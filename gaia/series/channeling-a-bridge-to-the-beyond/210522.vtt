00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> At the beginning
of the 1900s,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
humanity was being influenced
by photographs, newspapers,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
stage plays, and silent films.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:10%
During the 1930s,
the major studios

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
began creating motion
pictures with sound,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:10%
bringing these stories
closer to real life.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:10%
By the 1960s, color television
became a novelty item

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:10%
for several families.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people could
be influenced simultaneously

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
by highly edited
stories, giving them

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
a longer glimpse into
alternate realities

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that stage plays and
artwork couldn't do.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
The race for space was underway.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:10%
And humans began wondering
if contact with other worlds

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:10%
could actually be possible.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
As the late 1960s
swept the planet,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
more and more humans began
to awaken to the possibility

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of a greater reality.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And the shades were opened
on the occult secrets

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:90%
held in the libraries.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.801 align:middle line:84%
And new messages began
filling the shelves.

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Channel texts became
more and more available.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:10%
And the occult labels
and misconceptions

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
about this mysterious form
of spiritual communication

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:10%
began piling up.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:10%
It was becoming a phenomenon.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> My interest in the occult
began when I was growing up

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s in the borough
of Queens in New York City.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:10%
I was fascinated with mythology
and folklore, the paranormal,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:10%
the supernatural.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I vividly remember
my sister coming home

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
with books about Bigfoot
and flying saucers

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and the works of
Carlos Castaneda.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I was very interested
in astrology.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know where
all this came from.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:10%
>> I grew up in a house
that was so haunted,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:10%
you would set something
down, turn around,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
it would disappear.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.793 align:middle line:84%
We'd be watching TV,
back in the old days,

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
physical dial that you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
had to stand up, walk across
the room, and turn the knob.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, while we're sitting
down on the couch watching TV,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:90%
the knob would turn.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We would hear footsteps
going up and down

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
the hallway, toilets
flushing downstairs when

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
we were upstairs.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It was just so overwhelmingly
paranormal, it was crazy.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
When I started
telling my parents,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing these things,
I'm communicating

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
with these things, my
parents were like, OK.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back to our
old church, which turned out

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a spiritualist church,
which is your typical stand up,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
sit down, stand up, sit
down, stand up, sing.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But services ended when one
to three mediums would go up

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
on stage, go into a
deep trance, and spirits

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:90%
would channel through them.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Every Saturday night
in the church basement,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
we were doing seances.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with this everywhere.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you, also, my parents'
basement was full of books.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I could read about
anything that I wanted to.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the books that
stuck out the most to me

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
was Manly P. Hall's "Secret
Teaching of all Ages."

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And as a young teenager,
I'm devouring this book,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:90%
going, wow.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
These are the secrets
that I've been after.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.867 align:middle line:84%
This is what the Whisperers
have been talking to me about.

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Whisperers were my guide.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I get it.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.467 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's writing
about this stuff.

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, growing up Christian,
we believed the Bible was

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:90%
channeled by the Holy Spirit.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We just didn't use that word.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:10%
The word "channeling" is usually
associated with the occult

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:10%
and mysticism and
things that religion

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:10%
tends to shy away from.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.415 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask any good
Christian to explain

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
how the Bible is
written, they'll

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, the Holy Spirit
possessed one's mind

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing it
and wrote through them

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.963 align:middle line:84%
the words that it
wanted to write.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that sounds
a whole lot like channeling.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just different
words for the same thing.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call
it "inspiration,"

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
that word can be used as well.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think, especially
in religious circles,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
the word "channeling" inspires
occultism and things like that.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So they think it's a
word that's off-limits.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually, in my
estimation, exactly what

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
they believe of the Bible.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Several legendary stories
throughout religion have been

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
delivered through humans hearing
voices and carving or writing

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
down the messages.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:10%
This practice continued,
as oracles, prophets,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:10%
and poets shared their
messages through pen and paper

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:10%
and eventually the typewriter.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
automatic writing

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is another highly debated
form of channeling that has

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:90%
several different meanings.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:90%
But the question remains.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Who is moving the hands
and writing the message?

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the modern
age, automatic writing is one

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
of the most popular
forms of mediumship.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was very popular
in the United States

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and Europe, going back
to the mid-19th century,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
where an individual seated with
a piece of paper and a writing

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
implement, would feel that he
or she was receiving some kind

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
of extra physical information.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And probably the most popular
channel text in modern history,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
"A Course in Miracles," can
be considered the result

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
of automatic writing.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:10%
A research psychologist
named Helen Schucman

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:10%
at Columbia University
in the 1960s

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:10%
began to hear
clairaudient voices.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And she composed an
extraordinary comprehensive

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:84%
complex spiritual
psychology that

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
later came to be called
"A Course in Miracles."

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the
most popular channel text

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:90%
in modern history.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:10%
>> There's nothing that I would
call ordinary audition about

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.385 align:middle line:10%
this at all.

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a curious thing.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And it will be very
difficult to explain.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:10%
Somebody asked me, was it as
though your hand was moving?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:10%
I wrote perfectly
voluntarily, in response to--

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:10%
I call it a voice, but
a voice has sounds--

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:10%
or sounds as though it has
something to do with hearing.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:10%
I didn't hear anything.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the sort of hearing
that you can't really describe.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have anything
to do with ears or waves

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:10%
hitting a drum or
anything on that order.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe I'm using the
wrong word when I say "hear."

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I think "knew" may be a
better word than "heard."

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I sort of recognized it.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It came very easily, very
rapidly, very smoothly.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:10%
If I didn't catch a phrase, I
could sort of say "would you

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:10%
mind doing that again?"

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The story is
truly remarkable,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:10%
in that Helen Schucman,
in the early 1960s,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:10%
she was working with
a colleague, Dr.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:10%
William Thetford.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:10%
And they had worked together
for many, many years

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:10%
in this field of psychology.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Helen Schucman began having
psychic dreams, very, very

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
vivid dreams that she said it
"felt like some kind of entity

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.622 align:middle line:90%
was contacting me."

00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And for her, being an
atheist, of course,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
this felt very
bizarre and she almost

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
didn't wanna tell
anybody about it.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But she confided in
her colleague and said,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm having these dreams
of an entity coming

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to me that wants to
bring a message through

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like it
has a lot of authority.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to obey it,
but I don't know how

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:90%
to bring this message through.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And so William said, well,
next time you get this message,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
just say yes to it
and start writing.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And we'll read it together.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And if it sounds crazy,
we'll throw it in the fire

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and never talk about it.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's what Helen did.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The first message of
"A Course in Miracles"

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
came through, which
Helen describes

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
as "an inner voice"
that spoke to her

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and said, "This is a
course in miracles.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Please take notes."

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:10%
>> This is strictly mental.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, I would consider
it hallucinatory activity.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel it was that.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't my voice.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:10%
It couldn't have
been, because it

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:10%
talked about a whole area with
which I am entirely unfamiliar.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:10%
For some reason
or other, it never

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:10%
occurred to me not to do this.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:10%
I thought that this
should be done.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:10%
I made every effort
to keep it without me.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:10%
I did not want to intrude on it.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:10%
And I felt that it was a matter
of personal integrity not to.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:10%
I really did not
interfere with it.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:10%
>> And so she wrote for seven
years, almost every day,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:10%
chapter upon chapter of
a book that's, to many

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:10%
people's opinion, probably the
most profound channeled work

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:10%
ever came through her,
which was a sort of form

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:10%
of psychotherapy, using the
biblical gospel language that

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:10%
lays down this philosophy
of how to be in the world,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:10%
how to see one another
as one, not separate,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.757 align:middle line:10%
and how forgiveness actually
is the path to heaven,

00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
that the only way to get to
heaven is through the person

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:10%
right in front of me.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Because heaven is
entered two by two.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And Helen herself
said she wasn't

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
the best student of the course.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't very good at
living this philosophy, which,

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
to me, just speaks even
more about the validity

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
of the channeling itself,
that this wasn't something

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%
she could've made up herself.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the thing that I
found upsetting about it was it

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
went against
everything I believe,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:90%
which is very hard to do.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But I felt it was
much more important--

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:90%
I know what I believe.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't know what
this was going to do next.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Schucman identified
herself as the scribe,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:90%
but not as the author.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And she made this work
freely available to people.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And it first began circulating
through small study groups

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and then, later, was
published in the early 1970s

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and went on to become
a worldwide phenomenon.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of reasons
that "A Course in Miracles"

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
displays so much spiritual
genius in the way that

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:90%
it's written.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
One can read this
text and, even if you

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
don't know the
language yet, you can

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%
read it and go, my goodness.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:90%
This is profound.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
There's something
alive in this text

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and it starts to pull on you.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And you want to learn
the language system.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the "Course" is
a truly channel text

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in that, just like all
true channel texts,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
it will meet you where you're
at, spiritually speaking.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand what
you're ready to understand.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But the deeper you go
in your development,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:90%
the deeper the book goes.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
channeled text, especially

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
like "A Course in
Miracles," are texts

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that people return to
again and again for decades

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:90%
and decades of their life.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And every time you read it,
it feels like you've never

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%
read it before.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But I hadn't
caught up with it yet.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:10%
And I don't understand it.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:10%
And I still feel
very baffled by it.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:10%
I do think, and under
certain circumstances,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:10%
I think there are
questions I could probably

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:10%
write an answer to.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:10%
According to the
"Course," we should

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:10%
and everyone could ask about
anything and get an answer.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, even if one takes a hard
core materialist view of life

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and says, look, there's no
such thing as extra physical

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
cognition.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:90%
That's all delusion.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
She was writing this
down from her own psyche,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
from her own subconscious,
let's go with that for a moment.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with the
materialist point of view.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't reduce, by one
iota, the extraordinary nature

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:90%
of Schucman's accomplishment.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
If a work as complex, as
moving, as rich, as insightful

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
as "A Course in Miracles"
came from the subconscious

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of a research psychologist,
a self-professed atheist, who

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
just sat down and
took notes, what

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
does that tell us
about the unknown folds

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:90%
of our own psyches?

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, the
materialist or immaterialist

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
argument almost
becomes irrelevant.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Does it really matter whether a
skeptic or I agree or disagree

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of the source?

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at the result.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Another influential woman
who was raised near the famous

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Burned Over District in upstate
New York was Jane Roberts.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1960s, she and
her partner, Robert Butts,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.362 align:middle line:84%
began experimenting
with a Ouija board.

00:12:58.362 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:10%
>> We borrowed a Ouija board.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:10%
We didn't even buy one.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:10%
And after, I forget, once
or twice or something,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:10%
we started to get
stuck on the board.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:10%
The pointer would go over the
alphabet and spell messages.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:10%
>> And after a while, the
messages said they came from

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:10%
a personality called "Seth."

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:10%
The first thing I
thought of was, well,

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:10%
it's the subconscious.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:10%
Robert's pushing it
or Robert's saying--

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>> --I was pushing it.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:10%
So we went through that long--

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>> --kind of thing.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:10%
And after only maybe five or
six, seven sessions with it,

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:10%
Seth came through vocally.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:10%
I would start to know
what was going to be said.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:10%
And then, I would
start to want to speak.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:10%
I just began speaking
the words automatically,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:10%
for Seth, without
knowing what I was saying

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:10%
until I came out of trance.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:10%
There was no training per se
for this, no self-hypnosis,

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:10%
nothing.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It just came.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Although, I did give consent.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:10%
That is-- had I not wanted to do
it, it wouldn't have happened.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:10%
But I was so curious.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what was happening.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The revolutionary
book "Seth Speaks"

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
was published in the early
1970s and went on to become part

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of the game-changing 32-book
collection referred to as "The

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Seth Material."

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I heard about
the idea of channeling was when

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I came across Jane Roberts
and "The Seth Material."

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
that word sort of

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
started sticking in the
nomenclature of the New Age

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a kid, one of my
mom's favorite books was "Seth

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Speaks."

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Seth is a higher
level spirit that

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
was being channeled
through Jane Roberts.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jane Roberts was
one of those fun people

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that didn't know she had these
abilities, just it came on

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
like a flash, like a blip of
information coming through.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.267 align:middle line:90%
So she figured, OK.

00:14:58.267 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a spirit trying to talk.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I should do what everyone else
does, grab the Ouija board.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And that worked.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%
That worked for a while.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But then she realized she
was more of a mental medium

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and that the spirit was
speaking through her doing,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the automatic writing thing,
communicating with her.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:10%
So she was writing
all of these books

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:10%
as Seth channeling through her.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:10%
>> My consciousness
was just gone.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't an
out-of-body in the respect

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:10%
that I had another body.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I thought I did.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But I just came through the
window and then into the leaves

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and into everything.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I came
back that I found the script

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and realized that I
had to have written it.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't aware of my body at
all or the manuscript or writing

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:10%
or anything.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:10%
But the thing of it was that
the stuff that was in the script

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:10%
was stuff I had felt
while I was out.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:10%
But when I was out, I would
go into atoms and molecules.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:10%
And I felt their consciousness.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:10%
But then, when I
read the script,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:10%
it was terribly hard to
accept portions of it.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it pretty much went
against what I've been taught.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest messages
from Seth that I think is

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:84%
so profound is that
we create our reality,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
whatever our inner world is,
whatever we think, believe,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel, we're projecting that
outward and that we'll find

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
ways to make that reality
conform to our belief and that

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:90%
we create that.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And my mom loved these books.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.478 align:middle line:84%
She talked about
Seth all the time.

00:16:33.478 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
one of the things that

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
kept her positive
throughout her life

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and her spiritual
development is these lessons

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that came from Seth
through Jane Roberts.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Just really enhanced
her spiritual work

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:90%
and her spiritual practices.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Simply just by knowing
this information

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:90%
helped her out dramatically.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>> People, you might use them
or think of them as symbols.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Or no matter how
you say to them,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:10%
they have their own
fantastic individuality.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:10%
And whenever any beliefs, even
our own, blind you to that,

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:10%
you have lost.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you relate to someone
as simply a belief or you get

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:10%
your back up and you don't see
their reality, then we've won.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:10%
It will bring you
closer to people.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.895 align:middle line:10%
It will not divide you.

00:17:22.895 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:10%
If it divides you,
that is not what it is.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Jane Roberts' material, the
one thing that sticks with me

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:10%
is "the point of
power is the now."

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was a
pivotal piece of information

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:90%
for everybody to hear.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to realize,
maybe I could do that myself.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when I did start
going into medicine work,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I would be having these things
come forth that were well

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
beyond my pay grade.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this
is Hindu material

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
at the essence of these
philosophical teachings

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was thrilling
too, because I

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
think it's important for
people, and especially women,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
to feel like they
can be bringing forth

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
this high-level philosophical
information as well.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly enough,
"The Seth Material"

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
came out at the right time.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It was in the '60s,
where people were already

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
starting to explore alternate
paths of spirituality.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
They were starting to
question Orthodox religion.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're clamping
down on what

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
spiritual practice has to be.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So people were now
open and trying

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to explore some of
this extra material.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know what
the nature of spirituality

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:90%
versus religion was.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So "The Seth Material"
came in at the right time

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to actually spawn
that New Age movement

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual world
can be peace, love,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and light and happiness, that
you can achieve these higher

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
states of being without
the rigorous orthodoxy,

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can be that
conduit of spiritual growth,

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than some church telling
that you have to do it our way

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's the only way.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So the timing of
"Seth's Material"

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
was perfect to spawn this
whole New Age movement,

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we could actually
tune in and become

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:90%
our own spiritual teachers.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I don't call
Seth a spirit guide.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:10%
I never thought of Seth as
some white cloaked spirit

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:10%
who was just floating around.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:10%
Part of my life's
work certainly is

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:10%
to try to understand the
nature of our personalities,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:10%
our personalities, what
abilities we've got,

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:10%
what happens so that we can
get this kind of information.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that I really hope

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:10%
is that people would begin
to trust their own revelatory

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:10%
experience and not automatically
cloak it in whatever dogma

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:10%
they believe in.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Jane Roberts, I think,
was really someone who opened

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
the door for a lot of people
to know that they could

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
investigate these things,
that there are some profound

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
differences in states of beings
that humans can get into.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:10%
And certainly,
"The Seth Material"

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:10%
was really quite amazing
and quite distinct

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:10%
from almost anything else that
was out there at the time.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I think she's
generally considered

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
sort of the mother
of modern channeling.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of channels
have sort of gravitated

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to the way she presented herself
in a certain way and so have I.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.603 align:middle line:10%
She was very, in a sense,
irreverent about it,

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:10%
which was interesting.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.683 align:middle line:10%
Because I know she smoked.

00:20:37.683 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:10%
I know she drank
a beer before she

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:10%
channeled to loosen herself up.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And different people
have different ways

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:10%
of getting into that state.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:10%
And if she felt she
needed to just lose

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of her
inhibitions to do so,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:10%
well, then that's
what worked for her.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the fundaments
of "The Seth Material,"

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
the core information in
"The Seth Material," I think

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that in almost any
channel now, because it really,

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, I think,
in modern times, touched

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of those core
principles that, I mean, truth

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
is truth.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They may be said in
slightly different ways

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.308 align:middle line:84%
by different channels or
different philosophers

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
at different times, but I think
"The Seth Material" really laid

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
out the foundation for what the
core principles of metaphysics

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:90%
were really all about.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Real metaphysics, not
just outdated ideas,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:90%
but the core of metaphysics.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:10%
The idea of channeling
uses the same mechanism.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.640 align:middle line:10%
It's just it depends
upon the theme

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:10%
that the person chose,
the agreements that

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:10%
were made, so on and so forth.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But Seth is a multidimensional,
nonphysical being

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:84%
at this time, who has
experiences in physical reality

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge gathered from
all those experiences collected

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
back into what you might call a
type of oversoul, that can then

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
share those experiences
from a different perspective

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
as the collected
self, through beings,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
like Jane Roberts, that
are open to receiving

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:90%
such transmissions.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> As these powerful channeled
messages created a strong

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
foundation for this
growing phenomenon,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
these influential women ignited
the spirit of many to dive

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
deeper into the
nature of reality.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
As most will discover, there
is one constant message

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:90%
delivered throughout the ages.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancient wisdom, such as
the teachings of Vedic ancient

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:10%
India, where we have
these beautiful texts,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:10%
which are basically
communications between wise

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:10%
people and spiritual
intelligence that told them

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:10%
of the nature, they intuited
it, they experienced it through

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:10%
this multidimensional
communication,

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:10%
the nature of reality itself,
that all is consciousness,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:10%
all is mind and consciousness,
all the way through the great

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:10%
religious teachings, all the
way through to the more modern

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:10%
channeled texts, such as the
texts of Seth and "A Course

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:10%
in Miracles," almost all of them
speak that the deepest reality

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:10%
of the universe is that of love.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And what now, I and others
are bringing forward,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
with the evidence for such
unity expressed in diversity

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
is I sometimes call it
"the science of love."

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:10%
So in that regard, I honor
all the incredible giants

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
on whose shoulders we
stand, whether they

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:10%
be scientific giants,
spiritual, or in whatever way.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:10%
Because the scientific pioneers
also channeled, in many ways,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:10%
their own deeper understanding
of the nature of reality.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
What I do feel is important
is to honor and receive

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom, embody
it in our lives,

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and then go on
our own adventure.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So not to be held within it
as that is the only way, that

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:90%
is the only message.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look across
this vast panoply of wisdom,

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:84%
we see both the unity of
its underlying perception

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and we see the diversity
in which it's expressed.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And to continue that journey
in our own lives, I just feel,

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly important.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look in the
mirror, you will see images

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But you do not
perceive the inner self

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:90%
that you know exists.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And as so, each of us
here, as each of you,

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:10%
to realize that you have an
inner identity that you cannot

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:11.635 align:middle line:10%
physically perceive and an inner
voice that you do not hear with

00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:10%
your ears.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:10%
Each of us here, therefore,
before you, to admit

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:10%
the validity of your own being,
to enjoy the being that you see

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:10%
and feel and touch,
and yet to realize

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:10%
that you have a still
greater vitality and reality.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:90%
