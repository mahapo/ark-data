>> The flow state--

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:84%
most define this powerful
feeling as being "in the zone,"

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
fully connected to
the present moment.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
When humans reach
this state of oneness,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that allows the
power of the universe

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to flow freely through
us, to animate us,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to guide and inspire us, to
share our unique gifts with all

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The question remains--
is this flow state

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
a form of channeling?

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:10%
>> That connection with what's
arising in the moment allows us

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:10%
to drop out of the finite
sense of self and more

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:10%
into the universal self.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why everyone
describes the flow state

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
as a state of bliss
and joy and freedom.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.755 align:middle line:84%
It feels like, one is the
most alive in a flow state.

00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
>> What people sometimes call
flow state or inspiration,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:10%
I refer to as enthusiasm.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I think, enthusiasm, although
we hear that term all the time,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:90%
has mysterious qualities.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I find that when I'm
experiencing enthusiasm

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
at my back, I can write for
eight hours at a stretch.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I can sit down on a
sofa with my laptop

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.765 align:middle line:90%
and the hours just melt away.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When I write, because I
love to write and I'm called

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to write, it just
comes through me.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:10%
So whether you call it automatic
writing or I'm in the flow,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm in the zone, they're
all the same thing.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's that inspiration that's
inside of us that's either

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
coming from our own experience,
our own destined words that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
come out on the page for
the benefit of other people

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and for ourselves, or you've
been inspired by something

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.823 align:middle line:84%
you've run into that day--
a person or an environment--

00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:30.365 align:middle line:84%
and you just want to share it,
and it just comes through you.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many ways to
get into the flow state,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and it occurs when we are not
operating from the intellect

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
any longer, but we're in a
state of openness and surrender

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
to the present moment.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And so people get
into the flow state

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing it
just, through doing things

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:90%
that they enjoy.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to create a
larger space for that part

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So that could be a walk in
nature or meditation or writing

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
or dance or anything
that gets you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
into your most natural state.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The language of physical
reality is not words,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
is not energy, it's actions.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And when you act on the passion
that the higher mind sends you,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:10%
you're demonstrating
to the higher mind

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:10%
that you heard it, you
understand what it's telling

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:10%
you, that this is your
next step, follow it,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:10%
and you start that
dialogue then,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.857 align:middle line:10%
going between you
and the higher mind.

00:03:29.857 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:10%
Because once you're willing to
act on what the higher mind has

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.082 align:middle line:10%
already sent you, it will
send you more opportunities

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:10%
to act on your passion.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
If you don't act
on your passion,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.558 align:middle line:84%
the higher mind will
simply not send you

00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
any more opportunities, until
you act what it's already

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:90%
sent because why should it?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not acting
on anything, anyway.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's a real relationship,
even though it's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
another part of you.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we've created this
illusion of separation,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you have to develop
this relationship

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
with your non-physical
higher mind,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
the messages that it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
sends through the auspices of
excitement, curiosity, passion,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
love, creativity, and be willing
to act on it, take that step.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
>> As we become more connected
to those from all areas of this

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
planet, we are reminded that
no matter what shape, size,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
or color of skin, all
human bodies are supremely

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated in
design and structure.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
As science searches
for answers to explain

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
the human design and
our physical connection

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmos, there's a
powerful spiritual principle

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
about the grand design
of the separate forms

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:90%
in this physical reality.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything happens
in spirit first.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:10%
So anything that's in physical
reality starts with a template

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:10%
in spirit, so to speak.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Adjustments in that
spiritual template,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
when done in a certain
way, will make adjustments

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
in the physical version of it.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As ultimately, spiritual
beings having a human

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
experience, our perception of
ourselves, as human beings,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is very physical in the
main, and the appearance

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
of our physical selves seems
to be separate from each other,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
separate from our
planetary home,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
separate from the
wider universe.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:10%
That perception of
separation, as long

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:10%
as it helps us to have an
Earth experience of joy

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:10%
of relationship, is wonderful.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It's when we misunderstand that
appearance of individuation

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
as separation, and in
that sense of separation,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that illusion of
separation, we progressively

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
cut ourselves off from the
wider nature of reality.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Mitchell
was an engineer.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
He was also an Apollo 14
astronaut and the sixth person

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:90%
to walk on the moon.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:10%
He was on his way
home and the capsule

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:10%
was rotating 360 degrees.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:10%
He saw the sun, the
Earth, the stars,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:10%
and he was rotating
over and over again,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:10%
on his way back to the
beautiful blue planet.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he went into
this transcendent oneness

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Some people call that samadhi.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Edgar was no longer there.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
He completely
dissolved into oneness.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Felt that he was
intrinsically connected

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, the moon,
the stars, the Earth,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
part of him, as well.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This transformative
experience of oneness

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
hasn't just been
experienced by Edgar.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Many people around
the world have had

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%
these transcendent experiences.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:10%
You think about all
the different practices

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:10%
that incorporate
breathwork, you think

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:10%
about our physical body and
this idea of little c and big C

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:10%
consciousness that,
when we're contained

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:10%
in this physical body, we
feel separate, but somehow,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:10%
through meditation to
other altered states

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, we can
experience that big C

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, where
we are ourselves,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:10%
but also, so much
more than ourselves.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When we undertake
practices such as mindfulness

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
or meditation or
just being in nature,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
all of those help us to
remember, our innate wholeness,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
with the whole of creation,
with the whole of our universe.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Ra even says that meditation
is the most helpful practice

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to give the adept a foundation
upon which to listen

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:90%
to the creator.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And so meditation and channeling
are inseparable in that way.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
That until one can learn
to quiet the noisy mind

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
one isn't going

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to be able to receive
contact of higher information

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that the intellect
may disagree with.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
challenges of channeling

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
is that, a lot of
what comes through

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
is completely unknown
to the human mind

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:84%
or to our conception
of how reality works.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So not only does
there need to be

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stillness in the
mind, but a lot of openness

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to see
reality differently.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think,
beings who are looking

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
to contact the human
race at this time

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and deliver us
higher consciousness

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
are needing to find people
who've built this foundation.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone interested
in channeling,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the absolute,
preliminary prerequisite

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%
would be a meditative practice.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more we regularly
undertake those practices,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:90%
whatever they may be--

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I dance around
the kitchen table to ABBA.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That is my meditation practice.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I grow vegetables, that's
another meditation practice,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
but whatever it may be, when
it brings a song to our hearts,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
when it literally brings us
into that remembered wholeness,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
then that enables us
to not only understand

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
this emergent perspective of
unified reality, but crucially,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
vitally, to experience
it and embody it.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>> We all need to dig in
and open up these abilities,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and it's here and now.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
These old Oracle sites that
were shut down, cleared out,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the portals were closed--

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, we can't really access
that high-level information

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
in those places, but
we can in this place.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:10%
>> So we want you to first,
acknowledge you are channeling.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
You are channeling the
miraculous through you

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
When you feel love in your
heart, when you extend it

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to others who are as you are
in co-creation in each moment,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
you are channeling
divine voice through you.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:10%
This is what you are doing.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The philosophy to me, of
being a channel in the way I

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:10%
am, is simply that some
people, for whatever reason,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:10%
have made an agreement on
some level to bring through

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:10%
information in this particular
way as a vocal channel.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It is one way of expressing
the art of channeling,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
but I want to demystify the idea
so that everyone understands

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that this is not some strange,
mysterious phenomenon.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
is natural to humanity

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and really, without even
knowing it, a lot of people

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:90%
do it when they're in the zone.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Different forms of channeling
might require a different

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:90%
focus, a different dedication.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
what you choose to do,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:84%
what you're attracted
to, but if you

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
are attracted to a specific
expression of channeling,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
by following it, by acting
on it to the best you can,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
it will attract the
synchronicity that

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
will bring into your life
the elements, the tools,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the techniques, the knowledge,
the information, the people

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that need to be there to help
you move forward on that path.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of self-expanding,
self-guiding, self-correcting,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:10%
and if you just
act on it, that's

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:10%
what starts the ball rolling.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:10%
And the way you apply
that signature frequency

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:10%
through passion is to act
on your highest excitement

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:10%
to the best of your
ability, with no insistence

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:10%
or assumption as to
what the outcome ought

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:10%
to be, as to what
to come to fruition,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:10%
but to allow the synchronicity
in your life to present to you,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:10%
the opportunities that contain
that excitement so you can

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:10%
recognize it because excitement
is the compass needle that

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:10%
points to your magnetic North.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As a dancer flows to the
rhythm of a song or a direct

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
voice trance channel speaks of
the power of love and unity,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
connecting our hearts with
our minds and allowing spirit

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:07.205 align:middle line:84%
in all forms to flow through
us is a natural gift.

00:13:07.205 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.163 align:middle line:84%
>> When a medium or a
trance channeler is getting

00:13:16.163 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
into a channeling state, they
usually have to do some kind

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
of breathwork practice to get
them out of the thinking mind,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.463 align:middle line:84%
out of the identity
of the limited self,

00:13:24.463 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and into the universal self.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The trance channeler's mind
and mental capacity is used

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
as a tool.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So their education, their
vocabulary, the language

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they use is the
filter through which,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:90%
the channeling comes through.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So this term, the library of the
channeler's mind, denotes that.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, can a channeler, when
they're not trance channeling,

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
be able to access the
psychic reservoir outside

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:90%
of the library of their mind?

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe
that they can.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
There's unique
cases of channeling

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
where people actually speak a
language that they don't know.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
So my language is English.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
If I trance channel, I
might be able to speak

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
French or Spanish or Italian,
when I don't actually know it.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's numerous
verified cases of this.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So in that case,
the trance channeler

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
was going beyond their
library of the mind

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to speak
a different language.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I actually asked about
this during our focus group

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:90%
at Mount Shasta--

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
how can that be
possible if you're

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%
using the mind as a tool?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
The answer was, if the
person had a past life in one

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of those countries,
then the memory

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of that is actually
in their DNA,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're more easily able
to speak in that language.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
They also said that there
is a type of channeling

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't go through the
library of the mind, where

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
it is a complete
incorporation, if you will.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
The supposed being, if they
are of a strong enough nature

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and high enough frequency,
they just move the body

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.795 align:middle line:84%
and communicate without having
to go through the mental.

00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Every time that we went to
Egypt and I started to channel,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:10%
I used to say to the people,
what I am channeling is not

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:10%
the person that is living in
the temple, but the spirit,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:10%
the code of the information that
those people have pronounced,

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:10%
said, and resound between
the walls of that temple.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
That, just by opening yourself,
it's like if you are living it

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:90%
and you are able to become it.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I used to compare
channeling with trying

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:90%
to be an actor or an actress.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like allowing
yourself not to be yourself

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:84%
so you can allow another
data of someone else

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:90%
to act through you.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> As more receive messages
and guidance from the beyond,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:84%
will it be love or fear that
leads us through this journey

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.335 align:middle line:84%
to share our gifts and powerful
messages to help each other?

00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> As you can imagine, making
this transition from being

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:84%
a teacher of the Bible to a
teacher of extraterrestrial

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
channeled information was not
a transition that my religious

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
family and friends
were very privy to.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
I knew was inevitable.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
That, if I make
this transition, I'm

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
probably going to lose most
relationships in my life,

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:84%
but I think, any time we
feel so much inner conflict,

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
in a way we're living
inauthentically, we become more

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and more willing
to take those risks

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:84%
and to be willing to give
up anything for authenticity

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and being in integrity and in
alignment with our own truth.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And so after many
years of wrestling

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with that fear of
everyone's going

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to hate me call me a heretic,
a cult leader, which they did,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I just decided, there isn't
anything more important

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
than waking up every
morning with peace of mind

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
that I'm being true to myself.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm following the inner calling
that has been placed upon me,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and although, it was the
toughest decision I've ever

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
made in my life, it was also,
hands down, the best decision

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I've ever made.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For the first
time in my life,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
my personal and my professional
are aligned in such a beautiful

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful every single
day for the work that I do.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm so
blessed and lucky to be

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
able to do this
work and bring it

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
into the world in
a profound way.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Channeling Bashar has
definitely changed my life

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:10%
in profound ways.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, again, not everyone has
to believe that Bashar is real,

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:10%
but the information
can be proven

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:10%
to work because he's
delivering it like a kit.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:10%
He understands we're
physical, and he

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:10%
understands we need
practical applications that

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:10%
work in physical reality.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So he delivers information,
which he sometimes

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
calls an instruction
manual or the formula,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and when people follow
it as precisely as

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
possible, with an open
mind, they usually

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
find that profound changes
will happen in their lives.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they can prove to themselves
that the information works.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of
whether it's coming

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
from an alien entity
or a part of my higher

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
self or my own subconscious
mind, that doesn't matter.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
What matters is that
the information helps

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%
people live better lives.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very important for us,
at this time in our evolution,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:10%
for human beings to understand
that evolution is not just,

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:10%
about being on planet Earth and
watching things change around

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:10%
you.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It is about you being able
to access your abilities.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The human being has to
evolve into these higher

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The intellect of where we have
been to where we are going

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
requires us to tap
into our extra senses

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
so that we're able to move
into a different dynamic

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
everything around us.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality means that you are
choosing to evolve yourself.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So that is why it's
so important for us

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to be inspired and feel amazing
about opening ourselves up

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to these knowledges and these
informations and this wisdom

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
so that we, in our species,
can go higher in our evolution.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So that we can one day, not
have war on planet Earth,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
where we understand each other,
appreciate each other no matter

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
what sex you are, no
matter what color you are,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:84%
no matter who you are,
whatever culture you are.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We're not just in
harmony with each other,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
but we're in harmony
with the animal kingdom,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
we're in harmony
with nature, we're

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with everything,
and at that point in evolution,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that's when other beings will
make themselves known to us.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And they will share
their technology,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and they will share
their resources,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:84%
but until then, we have to make
that choice for our maturity

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and for our existence.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I just invite
anybody and everybody,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
who is willing to step on
this path, this adventure,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we don't
have to have these fine-tuned

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
sensibilities to be able to
receive and channel at depths.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:90%
That may come.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It may not.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's innate to all of us, but
the degree to which it comes

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:90%
is unique to all of us.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The beautiful thing about
moving through your fears when,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
if you do want to connect
and you have reservations,

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is that's going to
transfer into your life.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
become more empowered

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
in your physical living world,
as well as within this aspect

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:90%
of the unknown.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we're honest
with ourselves,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
we are living in the
unknown all the time,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's where we
dance with source,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's where we create,
and it's how we fall in love,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and it's why we laugh.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So working through those
fears in the metaphysical

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is only going to make
your life more expansive.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the awakening.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:10%
It's the shift of consciousness.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:10%
The shift of limiting beliefs,
the old ways of being that

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:10%
have been passed along
generation to generation.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
These old foundations, the old
ways of thinking, do not work.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The old structures
and foundations of old

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
are crumbling away and new will
be formed for a better world,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really time for us
to connect together and feel

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
a part of this
awakening community.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to participate
in this bigger picture

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and really be part
of this awakening

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves and for humanity.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that, that's
why we're all here--

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:10%
to do just that.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
To open up to the greater
us, the greater God self,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
if you would, which will help
the whole planet because Theo

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:84%
says if we recognize who we are,
the divine beings that we are,

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:90%
we'll have peace on our planet.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've
chosen to be here now,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
in this transformation
of consciousness.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing
such a greater awakening

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have an interest in this.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So many people
are having some of

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
their own personal
experiences of opening,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and they want to understand it.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many
parts of our world

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that people don't have
access to friends or family

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that can believe in what
they're experiencing,

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeking
community, they're

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
seeking connectivity and
understanding of self.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>> So our message is to
trust, she would say,

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:10%
your inherent self.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:10%
We are saying that your feeling
nature can take you home

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:10%
to, what you might call,
your euphoria-- yes.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Your being is important.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:44.540 align:middle line:10%
The fact that you are
[NON-ENGLISH] impresses us,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:10%
the universe, and that
impression is never lost.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Each and every one
has an important role,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
an important gift that is unique
to them to share with all,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:90%
and now is the time.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
No one can do what you can do.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:84%
They might do something similar,
but they can't do what you do.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I know that to be true.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We appreciate the
opportunity to serve.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:90%
God's love on to you.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Our deepest
appreciation to all of you,

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:84%
our deepest gratitude for
the co-creation of this

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
interaction, our
unconditional love to you all,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and in our own language,
we say, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:90%
In service to you.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:90%
