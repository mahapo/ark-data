00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history, the
third eye has been a topic

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
sequestered to secrecy, isolated
in a cult. But in the brain,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:90%
the third eye is in the center.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Through the imagery
of ancient mysticism,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
this all-seeing eye has had
several interpretations.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Most believe that we have
some psychic eye within us.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But the question
is, are the visions

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
we see with it a
form of channeling?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I wanted one simple answer.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to just
discover the one easy way

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:10%
to know how channeling works.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:10%
And what we found
in Mount Shasta

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:10%
was that there were likely
so many different ways that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:10%
channeling works,
and that it depended

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle line:10%
on the type of channeling
that the person was doing.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And so, in channeling that we
received about how it worked,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:10%
there was this idea
that information

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:10%
in the form of light came
through the pineal gland.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is a master
gland, transmuted that light

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
in some way to
influence the DNA.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Because our pineal gland
has light sensors within it.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the small gland within
the center of the brain,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and it has long been
anecdotally known

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to be associated with psychic
abilities and channeling

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:10%
>> The pineal gland is right
where the third eye is,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:10%
the sixth chakra.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
Plato even talked about.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
He told us that we
have a third eye.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:90%
It may be the seat of seeing.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, anything we can do
to clear off our pineal gland

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and open it up is going to
support us in this oracle work.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The pineal gland is the
more spiritual trigger,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:10%
in my view of things.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It is a catalytic converter,
if you will, for spirit energy.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Your quintessence coming
down through your body,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
rising up from somewhere
else in your body

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and catalyzing within
the pineal gland.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I've seen pineal glands that
have the energetic colors

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
of a Pixar movie, and that
is a person who is awake,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
how awake they are yet.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, they need to do their
work-- yoga, Tai Chi, prayer,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
chanting, a walkabout,
whatever they need to do.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Find a place where
they're happiest,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and that will catalyze
that even more.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is important
equally to the basal ganglia.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The basal ganglia is
really the end point

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of the intuitive
system in the brain

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
because the gut level intuitive
system and the vagal system

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
tell the brain what to do
and the pineal, what to do.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
When language comes
up into the brain,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the basal ganglia
is the one that

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
translates that
into whatever sector

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:84%
the visual, auditory,
kinesthetic language

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the brain.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, the pineal,
which is really

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
like the all-seeing eye in
the brain, watching all this

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
happen, and it will catalyze
at a different level.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The brain catalyzes
it at our human level.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland catalyzes
our spiritual level.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's our job
to integrate the two.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a fascinating
relationship between solar

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:10%
flares, and
geomagnetic activity,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:10%
and channeling experiences.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So when geomagnetic
activity is high,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:84%
we see a higher incidence of
expressive type channeling

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like seeing ghosts,
or poltergeists, or mind

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
over matter type experiences.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:10%
When geomagnetic
activity is low,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:10%
there's a higher prevalence of
clairaudience, clairvoyance,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:10%
telepathy, things like that.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
fascinating relationship

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
between our planet, and us being
on the planet, and our larger

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
What's also fascinating
about that is it

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:90%
connects to our pineal gland.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And so, we see this connection
between geomagnetic activity

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:10%
and the pineal gland,
and the pineal gland

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:10%
and this supposed relationship
to channeling experiences.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Several channeled messages
center around connecting with

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos above to provide
guidance and power to us below.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
The ancient practice of sun
gazing during the sunrise

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and sunset hours has been
thought to stimulate and ignite

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
visions within this mysterious
all-seeing eye in our brain.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we
consciously tune and connect

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
our sixth chakra with
the other chakras?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:10%
>> I think to understand our
innate abilities to channel,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:10%
in other words, just to open our
awareness to the greater nature

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:10%
of reality itself, is, how
do our bodies tune with this

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:10%
cosmic information, this
universal information

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:10%
that's available to us.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies
themselves, of course,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
are coherent
informational entities,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:84%
which are always within
themselves, and also

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
in our surroundings, and with
the whole universe, sharing

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
information, whether
aware of it or not.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
attributes of our bodies,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
such as some of our
endocrine glands,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
such as our nervous system
that are particularly attuned,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that are particularly
able to transduce

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:90%
large amounts of information.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And our pineal gland, which
is the perceived Ashna

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
chakra or insight
chakra, is one of those.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
informational network

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that can process enormous
amounts of information

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and then share it throughout
our bodily perspectives.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
We have other aspects.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The chakras,
generally, are deemed

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to be moderators
of that information

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
or transfer between us
and the wider cosmos.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Chakras are the
electromagnetics that come off

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
of your nervous system.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:90%
There are seven primary chakras.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at them--
and you can have your own

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.056 align:middle line:84%
experience, but I think this
is a place for you to start--

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
you feel something,
say, in your belly

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
because the third chakra is
located in the solar plexus.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
When you feel
butterflies, that's

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:90%
your third chakra ticking off.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So it extends out of
the body in the front

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and extends out of the body in
the back, same with the heart--

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
the front and the back.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Throat-- front and back.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Sixth chakra, where you
can see, front and back.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Seventh chakra, up
to your quintessence.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And your quintessence
comes down through it

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and feeds all of the energy
centers in your body.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
What's so interesting
about it is

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that it integrates with the
nervous system of the spine.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There's one in the root
that extends straight down

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in between the legs off of
the coccyx, the tailbone

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra is in
the lower abdominal area

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and goes through the front
and the back of the body.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
These are the primary ones,
and they guide your life.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
The southern hemisphere guides
the root and rudimentary parts

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
of your primal life.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The upper chakras,
they're your spirit world.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And the heart is the integrator.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The chakra system is an
energy dynamic system that is

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:10%
operating in energy field
that are both parallel

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:10%
and inter-dimensional.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're
operating gateways,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
like a stargate, that opens up
different levels of information

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universal
field of intelligence.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
begin to understand

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that the chakra is not just
a spinning ball of energy,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:90%
it's a stargate.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient mystical
traditions talked,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
not of a sevenfold
chakra system,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
which is our sense
of personal self.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you like, it's
our informational field

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that moderates and mediates
our personal sense of self

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and plugs us into that
greater cosmic wholeness.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about a
12-fold chakra system,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
where, as part of
mystical journeys,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
our awareness expands as it
were to higher vibrational

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
levels of awareness,
where we can literally

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
attune progressively with
more and more archetypal

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
expansive aspects of
universal consciousness.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me that,
now, we are everyday mystics

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that more and
more people are expanding

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
our awareness beyond that
sevenfold chakra system

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:90%
into transpersonal awareness.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that has been
guided by this understanding

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
of an 8th, 9th, 10th,
11th, 12th chakra.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
They're revealing that we have
this ability and, perhaps,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary
opportunity to be embodied

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
as what the ancients and
the mystical traditions

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:84%
would call Christed or
Buddhic consciousness.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So the more that we attune our
bodies through inner practices,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness, meditation--

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:90%
this was the ancient tradition--

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
we are literally tuning up
our entire information system

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to more easily access such
universal non-local cosmic

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So learn about chakras.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
They're valuable.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
They're an important
part of your radar,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
of how you feel in your body
and in the world around you.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You learn to play with them
because they're guiding you.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
They are a reflection
of your nervous system.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
They are a reflection
of your spirit

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and your soul inside your body,
and they will help guide you.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:90%
They help you heal.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The powerful art of plant
medicine has been used to help

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
humans ignite their third
eye, unlock dormant memories,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and pierce the veil
to other dimensions.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Shamans, throughout history,
have been the major guides

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
for humanity to discover
the spiritual and healing

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
powers of the plant
kingdom, but shamanism also

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
has several other forms of
connecting with the spirit

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Many, many traditions, many
traditions have worked with

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional communications,
channeling to gain great

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:90%
guidance.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember stories
of researchers

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
going into the Amazon jungle
and speaking with the shamans

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:84%
there, who have an encyclopedic
knowledge of plants and plant

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And when asked, how
did you get to this?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
The response was, we were told.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:90%
The plants told us.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
The plants were guiding us as
to what was beneficial for us.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think such channeling,
such openness to this guidance

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
is universal across
human experience.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Shamanism is
about relationship.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's about the relationship
to nature, ancestor, food,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a relationship.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
When we look at shamanism--
and people think shamanism,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
they always associate
it to plant medicine.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The Western world has
basically turned shamanism

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:90%
into a Hollywood gimmick.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
When people think shaman, they
think Native American culture,

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Peruvian culture.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
that the core of shamanism

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
has come from Africa,
Mongolia, and has spread out

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
from the Maori to
the Aboriginals

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Sami people
of the Nordics.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:10%
When we talk about
medicine in shamanism,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:10%
the way we look at medicine is
the information and knowledge

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:10%
that you bring
through your being.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So you are medicine
to the world.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times,
people think, medicine,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.042 align:middle line:90%
they think just plant medicine.

00:13:49.042 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a very different thing.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
The other understanding
of shamanism

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:90%
is what type of shaman are you?

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's earth
shamans, who, as you know,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
deal with different
types of medicines.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:84%
They're very knowledgeable of
the different medicines that

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
are available, and
they know how it's

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
going to affect the
spirits of the body

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's all connected
to the earth, the body.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is mother nature.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, when
people think of mother nature,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
they think Mother
Nature is earth.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Your body is made
up of everything

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that Mother Nature
is, so this is earth.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So they are aware of what earth
requires in order to heal it,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to replenish it, to
give it its sustenance

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that it needs in order
for it to continue to be

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:90%
ever expanding and ever living.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Then, there are water shamans.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Water shamans deal more
with emotional content.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, there are
the fire shamans.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
African tribes, there's
a lot of fire shamans.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They represent the aspect of
fire, which is the masculine.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a very masculine
ritual, and it also

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
is there to break your mind.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's there to take your
mind apart by intensities

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
until you literally
come undone, and then

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
that's how you actually start to
heal, and change, and so forth.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
The air shamans are the ones who
create sound, chanting, music,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
anything that can take you
into a trance-like state.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you see people
who are speaking in tongues.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Shamans who will use music that
take you into a trance, this

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:90%
is air shamanism.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, the spirit also
has the spirit shamanism,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
which is what I am, where
we not only make sounds,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
but we also commune
with all the spirits.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit shaman is
one who uses frequency.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:90%
We use sound.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
We can have things
come through us

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and bring new information
through sound.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to have a
spirit come through,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I can-- right now, I can
hear the spirit speaking

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
One spirit is saying,
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And I see these three men there,
dancing in the spirit world,

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
saying this over and over.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:90%
I hear this.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So then, I just let
it come through,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and I speak it into this world.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, powerful
things start to happen.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> As with most knowledge
passed down through shamanic

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
practices, misuse and
misunderstanding of these

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
sacred practices and plant
rituals have connected humans

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to spirits from less
desirable dimensions.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's controversy today
about the use of psychedelics

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
in the oracle field and
by anyone, in general.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:84%
There are two sides
of the coin here.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
One is that, yes, these plants
are a major opener for us

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get information.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
On the other, there
are hazards that

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
can come with it, including
getting connected with beings

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that you might not
want, and there's

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
discussion as to whether
these astral realms are being

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:90%
hijacked by unfriendly forces.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And this also goes
along with how

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
these plants may be transmuted,
hybridded, changed around.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not exactly
what they used

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to be when we were working
in a more pure way with them.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So there are some risks that
go along with using them.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
That said, many, many
people are starting

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to open up to the reality
of other dimensions

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and are being able to
receive information.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics are a very
interesting way of bringing

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:10%
about the channeling
state because they do have

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:10%
the ability to open that
gateway to intelligent infinity.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who's
taken psychedelics,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:84%
at least at a certain dosage,
understands the ability

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
these plant medicines
have to connect you

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:90%
with higher consciousness.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But it does come at
somewhat of a price tag

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
because psychedelics
use up enormous volumes

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of our vital energy,
which can get us

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
into these very high states
and then drop us out of them

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:90%
very abruptly.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayahuasca and other
psychedelics give you

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:90%
an experience in your brain.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't change your
spiritual aptitude.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
They may give you an experience
that feels very spiritual,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's authentic to that
person, but it doesn't last.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:84%
They still go back to the
office grumpy, or searching,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and we're always searching.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:90%
We're always searching.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want
to shift the gears

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
inside your precious neurons,
and open up your heart,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and open up the soul so it
starts moving through you,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the simplest practices
are always the best,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and that, really, is meditation.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, beyond that,
your skill of observation,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to
the way you feel.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's empathic.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's empathic.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Some are off the scale
empathic, and it's hard on them.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But pay attention to it,
and learn to rise above it.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:90%
You won't need the psychedelics.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
They're interesting,
so I've heard,

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
but they're also really
hard on the body.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.195 align:middle line:84%
And somebody who's had brain
issues, and brain surgery,

00:19:34.195 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and was lucky enough
to come through it

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and still stand
up vertically, you

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
don't want to mess
with your brain.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:90%
You need it.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we need
to be wise in our use.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a lot
of teaching and guidance

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
in this realm, if
we're really going

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to have sacred
medicines be useful

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and not turn into
something negative.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The natural teachers
provided by the Earth are

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:10%
for the purpose of helping to
remind you where you really

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:10%
come from, what you really are,
connecting you to different

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:10%
levels of your consciousness,
to different dimensions

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:10%
of experience.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The natural teachers
of the Earth,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
when not abused or falling
into a crutch or an addiction,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:90%
can be very helpful.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But always remember that once
you have allowed yourself

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
vibrational state that

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
is created by allowing yourself
to work with those plant

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
teachers or other natural
teachers from the Earth,

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
once you are familiar
with that frequency,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily need the
teacher anymore to recreate it.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Beyond a certain point,
it becomes an addiction

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and a crutch, whether
physically or psychologically.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's always about
self empowerment.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
It's always about
taking responsibility

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
for the vibration, knowing
that once you know what

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
a vibration felt like,
you're already in that state,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
even if it doesn't
feel the same.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you cannot experience
what you're not already

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be the
vibration of an experience

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to even remember you
had an experience.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> A unified message delivered
through mystics, shamans,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
plants, and messengers reminds
us that a balanced connection

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to the planet is a powerful
practice for spiritual

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:10%
>> We are reminding you to
channel your incredible force

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:10%
energy.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And the higher, the more
that you embody these things

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
from this higher intelligence,
the more information

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:90%
can come through.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But where's it going to
go if it is not utilized,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
if it is not put
into action to create

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
new systems, new ways
of seeing health,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
new ways of
connecting with body,

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
new ways of collaborating, with
reconnecting with the Earth's

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
intelligence, yes?

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
What about the
Earth's intelligence?

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
What is coming up through
Earth at all times?

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Incredible intelligence and
life force, allowing you to be.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's incredible
amounts of information

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are just
generally not aware of.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is that
saying of above and below.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:90%
It is within all things.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:10%
>> For thousands of years, we
have been walking this planet,

00:22:48.790 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:10%
this Earth, this land,
staring at the waves of water,

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:10%
wondering who we are.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
From all over the horizon,
it reached us, the question,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%
who are we?

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Human.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> As messengers guide us to
find the divinity within all

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
things and our spiritual
site becomes stronger,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
what messages will be received
when we consciously connect

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.825 align:middle line:84%
our third eye to the rhythm of
our heart and this beautiful

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:53.625 align:middle line:90%
planet?

00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:10%
>> There are journeys of
consciousness that no one can

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:10%
take but you.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:10%
And yet, you take them
as you take steps.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:10%
In other terms,
what have I learned?

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And you leave a mark for
your brothers and sisters

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to follow in their
own explorations.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:10%
>> If you could see
yourselves as we see you,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:10%
there would be no
discontent, no argument.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:10%
You would honor each other
appropriately with love.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
You would be collaborative and
not separating, not judging.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You would be assisting
each other more

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:90%
fully than you do today.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's better today,
even though it seems not,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:90%
than it's been in the past.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
When you love
yourself enough, there

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is that solid state within
you that you call God.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And from that place of being
is the utopia, the peace

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:90%
you seek in the world.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And it is happening now.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
