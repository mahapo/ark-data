adherence to the yet unknown

mechanism, known in
India as kundalini.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:28.422 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Vital force the western medical

independent of physical and
chemical forces regarded as

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

living organisms.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:46.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Does it seem to you, I mean this
amping up of the kundalini on

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the planet what we were just
talking about with people living

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in their heads and their
auto immune systems, all these

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:57.317 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
conditions that we're seeing
now, it would seem like these

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:01.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
tie together and people need to
ground this energy and learn how

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.424 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to work with it as a
part of their medicine.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.993 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
We need to understand medicine.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I get this picture in my mind
as I say that of the symbol of

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
medicine of the serpent which is
very much the kundalini and the

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:19.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
wings and the crown and the
blooming of health and you might

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.509 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
see that plastered all over the
place. In a medical institution

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but nobody is really talking
about these fundamental actual

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
aspects of nature that
are working through us.

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:35.489 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I do agree that in my mind
the crown on that figure is the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
pineal gland the snakes are the
kundalini but you're right it's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
rooted in the earth and you have
to join the energies together or

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
you'll burn out
the system on the way.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.434 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And there are a lot of people
burning out various endocrine

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:51.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
glands. May it be a thyroid or a
heart attack, second major cause

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of death in North
America right now.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.543 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Cancer is the most at
this point in time.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.812 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So you'll see these systems
burning out because they're not

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:02.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
connected so you're quite right
with the auto immune diseases in

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
my mind but there are many other
diseases that fit into to that

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
same classification, you've got
to have your feet on the ground,

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:13.527 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
your head in the sky so you
can be able to tune in to the

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
various sensitivities
that are coming along.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:30.243 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Here we are with the symbol
of love, rose, which is also as

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
an essential oil is known to be
really good for heart chakra,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:38.852 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it's very useful in states
of agitation or depression.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:42.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I've also commonly used the
essential oil with issues of

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.727 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
fertility and the flower petal
itself besides being able to be

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:53.133 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
tossed in a salad as a wild
food is used in teas to relieve

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:59.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
stagnant liver chi which usually
comes from resentment and not

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.974 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
expressing resentments as well.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It softens things, it cools
inflammation topically as

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.547 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
washes as well.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's known to regulate the
menstrual cycle

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.686 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and part of the reason and way
it does that is through working

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with the liver chi
because the liver chi is directl

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the flow of the liver and
the processing of hormones

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is directly related to a
balanced menstrual cycle

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.732 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and good fertility.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.536 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The other thing about fertility
is that it's useful because it

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:31.872 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
helps us get into a
soft and receptive space.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Just being with rose is very
healing. I like to include it in

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the wild food section because in
fall, after the first frost

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:44.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we'll see little rose hips dried
up. And those rose hips are

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
incredibly good for avoiding
scurvy &amp; any other issues from a

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:49.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
lack of vitamin C.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:55.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So rose, a legend as it is, is
good for so many things for us

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:59.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and commonly found in our
gardens, and throughout time

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this has been used as a
medicine around the world.

The tobacco plant is one of most
sacred plants on the planet.

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.622 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
People from many different
cultures, have used this as a

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.459 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
means of communing with the
sacredness of life and it's

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.664 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
considered in many situations
and ceremonial settings to be

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
kind of the master of
ceremonies so to speak.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Today we see tobacco being
abused and mixed with many other

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.776 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
harmful chemicals and very
addictive chemicals and causing

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:48.682 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
disease in the process but when
we look to traditional cultures

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that use this plant in many
different ways from ingesting it

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:59.626 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as an entheogen which literally
translates to realizing the god

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:04.497 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
within you and realizing your
divine nature the entheogenic

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:10.303 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
uses as well as the common uses
in cultures where there's not a

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
whole bunch of other chemicals
mixed with this plant there's

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
very little dis-ease or things
like cancer that are happening

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.511 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
as a byproduct.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:23.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So this plant has an
alkaloid beta-carboline.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now the alkaloids function in
many different ways in the body

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but it's thought that the
nicotine alkaloids are basically

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:38.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
functioning and affecting
the pineal system in the body,

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:39.899 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
helping glandular system.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now that's a very complex and
dynamic topic but the thing to

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:48.575 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
understand is that it has an
effect on a psychological level

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and in that way, it is
considered an entheogenic.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:55.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But it's also used as an
anthelmintic or for removing

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
parasites.

00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.321 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The nicotine is very similar to
something called lobeline which

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.225 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is found in a herb called
lobelia which is incredibly

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
valuable for asthmatics
or people who have sort of

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:09.496 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
bronchial constriction.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I've seen people who are in the
midst of asthma fits who when

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
they take a tincture of lobelia,
immediately their asthma

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:19.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
symptoms will disappear.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Lobelia what it's doing is
balancing sympathetic and

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:27.747 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
parasympathetic nervous system
and it's sort of relaxing body.

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it can be used in many
different ways and the early

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:35.588 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
herbalists really thought of it
as a thinking herb, that which

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:39.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
balances out the nervous
system which is a huge part of

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
physiological functioning, if we
can keep the nervous system in

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:47.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
balance things are really sort
of in a calm and balanced way

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the energy is
flowing through the body.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.441 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So lobeline is used in asthma,
it's also used in anxiety, it's

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:58.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
used for helping people get
off of nicotine, people will use

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:58.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
lobelia.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The important thing to remember
about lobelia, lobeline or

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.854 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
nicotine is they will make
you vomit if you have too much.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If anyone has smoked tobacco,
they'll know that they will

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
get nauseous if
they've smoked too much.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.497 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There are places on the planet
where this is often taken after

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dinner with green tea just
to help digestion and ease

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:21.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
digestion.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:28.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So these lobeline, nicotine,
lobelia and tobacco are very

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
valuable plants.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There's some modern
research coming out that they're

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
incredibly helpful in allaying
the intense symptoms of cytokine

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
storm.

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:42.389 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now what that is, when the body
is exposed to viruses, such as

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:46.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the H1N1 virus for example.
It almost has an immune system

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
freak-out where the body just
starts to overproduce white

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
blood cells and it almost builds
like snowball effect and begins

00:08:56.403 --> 00:09:01.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to clog the system up to the
point where the immune response,

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.778 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you hear this in the hantavirus
as well, it seems like the

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:08.448 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
strongest people are the ones
that get taken by the virus

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:11.584 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is very strange, it's not
the young, it's not the elderly

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.987 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it's those with the
strongest immune systems.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:17.957 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, I've come across research
on the nicotine as well as

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:22.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
potentially the lobeline to help
work through the nervous system,

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:28.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to calm cytokine response in the
lungs for example so that the

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:32.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
person is not falling prey to
the over activity of their own

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
immune system.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now the tobacco plant is easily

it's something we really have to

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.483 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
re-evaluate and sort of
restructure our relationship to

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:47.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%

I wanted to speak about
the effect of plants on our

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:04.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
nervous system and
on our state of mind.

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.675 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We commonly speak about the
effect of plants on let's say

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:12.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the liver, the kidneys and the
heart, but we also recognize

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that there're certain plants
like valerian or st. johns wort,

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
gingko for example, rosemary.
These plants are well known for

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
their effect on the mind
and on the nervous system.

We're at Sage Garden Herbs right
now where they have an incredibl

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.099 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
specimen of san Pedro cactus,

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:37.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
It's at least 14 - 15 years old.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is one example of a
traditional plant that's been

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.943 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
used to heal on the
level of consciousness.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.983 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There's increasing research
coming out, that situations and

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:55.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
conditions such as OCD and
obsessive compulsive disorder or

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:58.858 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
anxiety, these types of
conditions that could be deeply

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:01.227 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
rooted in the psyche can
actually be addressed through

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:01.995 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
plants.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:08.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Other plants that we can use
that are commonly purchased at

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:15.074 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
herb greenhouses such as Sage
Garden Herbs is that tulsi or

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.075 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
holy basil.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:20.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This plant is kind of the queen
of herbs of India, which kind of

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:25.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
says a lot about this plant
because Indian society knows a

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
heck of a lot about plants.

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:32.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This plant when you drink it you
will notice, it brings you to a

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
place of deep calm and clear
mindedness, a sense of feeling

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:41.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
very centered yet very alert
and calm all at the same time.

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
It's known as an adaptogen.

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:48.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
adaptogens nurture the adrenal
glands but part of the reason

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:52.812 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the adrenal glands get so
exhausted, is that people are

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:56.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
running in a state of excessive
ambition and sort of fight or

00:11:56.049 --> 00:12:00.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
flight response for too long
periods of time, day after day

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:05.658 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
using stimulants such as coffee
and others, chocolate, sugar,

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:08.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and over time, the
glands start to wear down.

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Adaptogens not only nurture the
nervous system and nurture the

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
adrenal glands, but they keep
people in a state of inner peace

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:19.839 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
and inner calm.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When we talk about these plants,
we have to understand that these

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:30.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
particular healing plants that
work with consciousness, with

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:33.186 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the nervous system and with
the mind, they're working

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
biochemically.

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:37.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They can be working through
serotonin receptors dopamine

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:39.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
receptors and
things such as those.

00:12:40.293 --> 00:12:46.999 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But at the same time, they're
lending a quality of insight

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:51.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
into our own patterns of
being, that might be causing us

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:56.376 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
excessive dis-ease and so in a
traditional society, we are not

00:12:56.376 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
just trying to bandage over a
feeling such as anxiety or

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
depression but we are trying to
get insight into why we might be

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
feeling such
anxiety or depression.

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:09.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Some of these so called master
plants or teaching plants such

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as san pedro, iowaska, in the
native American culture, they

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:22.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
use peyote, even sage, cedar and
tobacco, they're all used for

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
helping the mind and that is I
think under represented in both

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:33.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
spiritual and physical sciences.
Because plants have always been

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:36.249 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
used in traditional societies
and we can see them functioning

00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in different religions
for helping people connect.

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:45.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Connect to the sacredness of
life, connect to their inner

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:49.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
wisdom and when we do that,
there's a healing power that can

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:53.833 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
come to the body as well,
they're not separate at all and

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.135 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that's something that we're
really working through today.

00:13:56.135 --> 00:14:01.174 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Certain plants such as smudging
with sage really bring that

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:05.812 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
quality into nervous system and
help the mind clear itself from

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:11.284 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
daily worry and a racing mind
and so in any holistic herbal

00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:15.254 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
system, we have to consider not
just the nutritional aspects of

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:20.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
plants but the personality so to
speak of plants

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:21.861 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and what they bring to the
personality of the individuals.

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:26.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They can take scared people,
depressed people, anxious

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:31.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
people and transform them into
calm, centered and transformed

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
individuals when used them in an
informed manner and many of the

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
indigenous traditions around the
world, including the European

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:43.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
traditions carry this knowledge.

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's very fascinating that
plants will actually affect the

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.287 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
human nervous system.

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:51.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When we look to traditions
systems such as Ayurveda, we see

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.227 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that what they're actually
saying is that plants are not

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
only capturing the 
vital force from the sun

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.297 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
and nutrients 
from the earth,

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but they actually
bring a special quality

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
to the human 
nervous system

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:05.271 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the human mind 
that is intent

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:23%

blooming.

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.654 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
have some things we
have to overcome.

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:29.929 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But in our modern world, people
living in high rises, isolated

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:34.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from nature, it's important that
we find time to get out into

nature, it's important that
we find a way to reconnect.
