My journey started when I
was in my early 20s.

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was living like the average
young Canadian man's life.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I was bar hopping, going to
college, I really was looking to

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:46.967 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
find my place in the world
and you know, I ended up on

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:52.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
antibiotics and those
antibiotics unfortunately really

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.043 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
upset my body and
upset my system.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I was on them for quite some
time and I didn't know I had any

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
alternatives to using those
antibiotics and around the same

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
time I got a job as a Wilderness
Guide up in Haida Gwaii in the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.961 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
northwest British Columbia
coast and in Haida Gwaii, I was

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
exposed to a whole different
type of people up there.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:25.005 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I was exposed to the first
nation's people the Haida and I

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
was exposed to a lot of people
who were living close to the

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:33.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
land and picking their medicines
from the forest which I thought

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.851 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at the time was, I just
thought it was absurd really.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:42.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It fascinated me but I had a
hard time understanding that

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they could be
medicines and free and wild.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:54.835 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But I got well there I
actually experienced healing.

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:05.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That was the start of my path of
learning, so I started to study

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
natural medicine through a
natural healing college in

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:15.789 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Canada, in Alberta, Wild Rose
College and I also began to

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
study Ayurveda which is a system
of natural healing from India

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:26.399 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that dates back at least
5,000 years and at that point I

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:31.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
realized that healing was really
different than the covering of

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.038 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
symptoms.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
My entire perspective of life
changed and in many ways I was

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:42.415 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
lost because I felt alienated
from the culture that I grew up

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.083 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
in.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I learned more about the ways
that chemicals are used in our

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.063 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
environment, in agriculture, in
medicine and how we might find

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.732 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
alternatives to that.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:03.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, if we want to find our way
back to healing, if we want to

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:08.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
end some of these health crises
that we are facing, degenerative

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
diseases, we have to look at
some key issues, we have to ask

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
some hard questions, such as how
do we get out of this situation

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.388 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
we're in?

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:28.428 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Being so immersed in this world
run by chemical institutions,

empires really, educational
institutions run by chemical

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
empires, we have to ask
ourselves how we can return to a

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.875 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
more natural way of life.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.278 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Not just for ourselves
but for the rest of nature.

of the challenges we are facing

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:58.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
include how to heal the
relationship between man

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
and nature.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:09.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%

been the common goal of those

who work in the field
of natural healing.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When you work with the systems
of natural healing it's really

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
fascinating because you come
to realize that plants, if it

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.784 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
wasn't for plants we just
simply wouldn't be here.

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:30.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They give us air, they give us
food through capturing the light

00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:35.295 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the sun and gathering the
nutrients of the earth and they

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
also have special qualities that
affect different areas of our

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
bodies differently.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.338 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
So, literally the only way
we can capture energy on our

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:49.175 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
biological system on this planet
is through green energy, AKA

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.545 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
plants, algae whatever, they're
the perfect solar receptor.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They're receiving biological
energy, on the other side of it

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the microorganisms and the fungi
they're recycling it, so on one

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
side we have the plants and then
we have the fungus recycling the

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:05.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
energy and all biological life
on the planet relies on those

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
two mechanisms.

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If we could think of our
ancestors even a few hundred

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:13.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
years ago, it's a plant world.

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:17.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I mean, they lived to directly
feeding off of the plants,

00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
feeding off of the animals that
feed off of the plants using the

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.145 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
plants as medicine, using the
plants as clothes, using the

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.982 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
plants for housing...

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:35.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
As nature we live within certain
laws, and though

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:37.891 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
nature celebrates diversity

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:46.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there are repercussions for 
stepping too far out of balance.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A big part of healing is
finding balance between the

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
masculine and the feminine and
that you'll see in the symbols

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:58.078 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of alchemy or even with
modern symbols of medicine.

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:01.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They're representing that
balance yet in actual fact, we

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.251 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are seeing nature more as a
commodity something to be

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:09.589 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
managed and controlled by a
very masculine perspective.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:14.928 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So there's a natural connection
between the feminine and the

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:18.531 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
respect of the female including
what's referred to as mother

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:22.268 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
earth but other people might be
more comfortable referring to

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the earth as our source of life.

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The first place
that the healing begins is when

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.487 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we come to the forest and
we learn to just be here...

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.634 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
breathe, feel our feet on the
earth, then feel ourselves as a

00:08:54.634 --> 00:09:00.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
part of nature because as we
get closer to our natural mind

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there's another level of
intelligence that comes out of

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:07.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
us and plants are always sort of
ushering us in that direction.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're always teaching us how
to be grounded, how to open, how

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to share and work
together and how to bloom.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.022 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And that's really the
essence of natural healing.

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:20.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, the first thing that we
have to do when we come to these

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:23.963 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
plants is acknowledge them
as living beings, not just as

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
something we are
coming to snip up.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:31.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Traditionally, there was always
some way of communicating to the

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:32.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
plants when you're harvesting.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.475 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Saying thank you in some way,
that doesn't mean you have to

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:39.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
offer tobacco necessarily,
though if that's your tradition,

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.015 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that's great, but what it
means is that there is some

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
acknowledgement between the
human being and the plant that

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:50.023 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
these plants are eating,
drinking, living, breathing and

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:50.623 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
experiencing.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:56.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so when we start to pick
medicine, the power of the

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
medicine isn't just in
the chemicals, it's in the

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.033 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
relationship.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:11.177 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So here we are in
the Boreal Forest with Uva Ursi

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.012 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
also known as bear berry.

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now, this low lying shrub is
an incredible antibiotic for

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:19.052 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
urinary tract infections.

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:22.655 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It can be made into a tea and
used as a diuretic though it is

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:25.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
quite strong and if you're
looking for just a simple

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
diuretic you might want to use
something like nettle leaf or

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:31.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
parsley or even
dandelion leaf for the matter.

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But when it comes to infections
of the kidney or any sort of

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:38.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
inflamed situations
this herb is incredible.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It has a natural antibiotic
quality that when combined with

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:46.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
other anti-infectious herbs
like barberry for example we are

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
going to get really good results
for clearing up chronic urinary

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.218 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
tract infections.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, if it's a reoccurring
urinary tract infection, you are

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:59.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
going to want to use a probiotic
like reuteri for example and

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:04.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
sometimes you will have to use
other natural antibiotics such

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:08.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as grapefruit seed
extract or colloidal silver.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now this herb, it's very high in
tannins so you don't really want

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to use too much of it at once
or for a long period of time, it

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
can get irritating
for the kidneys.

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:23.249 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This has also been used as a
traditional smoking mix, it's

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:26.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
one of the main herbs behind the
word kinnikinnick which means

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:27.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
smoking mixture.

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:29.822 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Some people refer to
this plant as kinnikinnick.

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The flavor of this plant when
smoked is just really nice and

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.297 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we have to remember that when
we inhale things whether its

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:40.667 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
rosemary or uva ursi we
are still getting medicinal

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
qualities and a lot of issues
with the lung are actually to do

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.273 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
with sort of damp conditions.

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:50.677 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The berries on this plant which
you can sort of see starting to

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:55.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
come into bloom or into
being here are just little green

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
berries right now but what's
going to happen is this will

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:03.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
turn a bright red and although
it's not really edible at this

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
stage, once it turns red it is
edible raw but its better cooked

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and its usually mixed with other
berries because it's not really

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.199 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that tasty but it is 
a good survival food

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
if you really need it.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:18.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now when we are talking about
urinary tract infections, one of

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:22.275 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the best herbs found in the
boreal forest is actually a

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:25.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
lichen, it's actually a
combination between a lichen and

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:28.648 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
an algae in a
symbiotic relationship.

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:30.316 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
They need each other.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:34.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is an incredibly potent
antibiotic when it comes to both

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
lung infections as well as
urinary tract infections.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:43.663 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This has been shown to be
affective against fungal

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
infections as well as
staph, pneumonia, strep and even

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
tuberculosis so this is one of
the best lung remedies we have

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:55.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and when we find this growing in
the woods it's usually hanging

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.244 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
off of the branches,
it's known as caribou food.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:00.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What we would have to do
actually be able to digest the

00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
medicine out of it, is grind
it up and even soak it with a

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
little bit of alcohol and
then make a decoction out of it.

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:11.324 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The only other option is to
make a full tincture out of it.

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:14.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have to remember that
bacteria are having a new sort

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:18.831 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of generation every 20 minutes
and it's almost as if there's a

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
collective mind in
an entire region.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:24.771 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Once they figure out how to
adapt around a particular

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:28.708 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
antibiotic which really isn't
really that complex, then every

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
branch of that bacteria is
able to do so in an instant.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.618 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So that's why we are seeing
usnea being so affective in

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:41.954 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
these situations where rounds
of antibiotics are not working.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:46.759 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So both of these can be
used effectively as natural

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:50.863 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
antibiotics, the usnea can
be used for the urinary tract

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.766 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
infections it can also be
used for lung infections.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In both situations, any
other additional herbal natural

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:03.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
remedies that are antibiotics
such as garlic, such as barberry

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:09.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
or golden seal such as osha,
we can use oregano oil, all of

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:13.386 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
these things are strong natural
antibiotics that we can call on

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:13.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
when we need them.

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
[[Music Playing]]

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.501 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So we're entering
a nice little birch stand here,

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:34.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
mostly paper birch but there's a
lot of different kinds of birch,

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
sweet birch...

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.746 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Sweet birch is the one that's
got the methyl salicylate in it

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:44.751 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is sort of an essential
oil component that's used a lot

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:45.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in pain relievers.

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:51.824 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Absolutely beautiful plant.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:58.531 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This paper birch is being
studied a lot right now for the

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
betulinic acid content in it.

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:05.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What you'll find is when this
tree falls down to the ground,

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the core of the tree will rot
out over time but the betulinic

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:15.014 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
acid in the bark keeps
the bark from rotting away.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:19.652 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So this betulinic acid is being
studied for everything from

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:25.892 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
sunscreens to skin cancer to
brain tumors, HIV, this is an

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:30.429 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
incredible aspect
found in nature.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:35.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So traditionally, we see this
birch bark being made as a tea

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:38.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but also the chaga mushroom
that grows off of a wounded or

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:44.076 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
rotting birch concentrates that
betulinic acid and blends it

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
with the SOD enzyme.

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:51.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So the SOD enzyme as I've
mentioned with rishi is really

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:56.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
concentrated form of enzyme that
helps the body shed toxins and

00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's found in highest amounts
in the longest living animals on

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.928 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
the planet.

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:06.966 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The longest living mammals, the
shortest lowest amounts of SOD

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are found in the shortest
lived mammals and animals on the

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.872 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
planet.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:18.477 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, SOD gets concentrated in
the chaga and this white is the

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
betulinic acid that we see here.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That is very special component
in nature, it is the opposite of

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:32.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
decay, it is the opposite of rot
and that is why it's being so

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:35.161 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
successful in some of these
diseases and if you think about

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it sort of doctoring of
signatures, it is white, not

00:16:38.965 --> 00:16:42.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
only is it a tree, a very sacred
tree around the world but it is

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:46.539 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
white and it brings light
where there is darkness.

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:54.814 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
[[Music Playing]]

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ok we are going
to walk over and have a look at

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:08.628 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
this over here. So we've walked
around here a few times, Chad's

00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:15.568 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
been here many times and we'll
maybe ask Chad and see what he

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:16.469 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
sees in this.

00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:23.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Well, for me basically right
off the bat I feel this unity of

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:26.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the circle but I really feel
the cardinal directions to the

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
setting sun and maybe the rising
sun so I really feel a sense of

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
orientation from it
that's what I get from it.

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:39.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Most people when you look at
this they will see this as a

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:43.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
medicine wheel and these two
short arms are just showing that

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:46.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
there are not just
four set directions.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:52.705 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In Ojibway teachings here in
the east, the color is yellow

00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:55.107 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the eagle sits in the
east and the eagle teaches us

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:57.777 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
strength because you can
fly closest to the creator.

00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:01.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the south, the color is red
and the wolf sits there and it

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.115 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
teaches you humility.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:06.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Over in the west the bear sits
there, the color is black and

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
teaches courage and healing.

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:13.526 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the north, the white buffalo
and the sabe sit in the north

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:17.163 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and teach truth because now
you can truthfully say that you

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:20.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
believe in sabes because I can
show you his footprint on the

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
way out.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then you can have the four
races of people, you can have

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the four cardinal directions,
you can have the four stages of

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
plant growth, you can do
medicine wheel teachings for

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.713 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
days and days and days.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Another interesting thing is
when you look at petroforms most

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:40.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of them are open within the
middle as we walk around and why

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:45.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that is, it's because when we
bring people here for healing or

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:49.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
doctoring we will place a sick
person in the actual form of the

00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:52.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
petroform and the different
medicine people will be on the

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.935 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
outside administering whatever,
but we always place the sick

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
person in the actual form.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:07.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[[Music Playing]] 

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:11.784 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And so when we
start to pick medicine, the

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
power of the medicine isn't just
in the chemicals it's in the

00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
relationship, so the intention
starts when we enter the forest.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:23.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The intention starts in our
state of being as we address the

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
plants.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
First, we want to look around
and make sure that we don't have

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:29.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to be concerned that this is a
clear cut that's been sprayed

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with chemicals to keep
shrubs down for example.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Or that we are harvesting on a
road side where it's getting a

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
lot of toxins.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These aren't things that we
want in our plants as we are

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
harvesting medicines.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We also want to consider
whose property we might be on.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:48.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We want to consider the weather
because juniper which is a solar

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:51.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
shrub, obviously you're going to
want to harvest it to get that

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
solar energy, you are going
to want to harvest it at a hot

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.564 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
solar time of day, at a
hot solar time of year.

00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Whereas other plants you might
choose to harvest at a different

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:05.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
time of year when you are
actually wanting a yin energy or

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a different time of
day or night or moon.

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So these are all things to
consider, it's how the intricate

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:16.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
workings and energetics of
nature are affecting the

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.117 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
medicines that we're picking.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The other thing that we're
looking at is if there is any

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.324 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
other sort of animal tracks
around for example we were just

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:29.728 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
picking blueberries here and
we noticed some bear droppings.

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:33.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So we're reminded instantly that
the bears are also eating these

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:36.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
blueberries and they are
surviving off of them and they

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.337 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
are not just doing it as
something nice to put on

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.138 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
cheesecake.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So we're really kind of
considering about what other

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:45.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
creatures are using this forest.

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:48.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We're sharing this forest, we're
stewards of this forest, we're

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:52.151 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
one of many community members
and that's essential when it

00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:56.355 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
comes to wild harvesting
and any sort of healing path.

00:20:57.723 --> 00:21:05.331 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[Music Playing]

00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So here we're at
an incredible shrub that's known

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.338 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
around the world, this is
juniper, and one of the first

00:21:12.338 --> 00:21:15.407 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
things you notice when you
approach a juniper bush is that

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:20.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it likes really sunny, hot areas
and that is exactly how the old

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.115 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
herbalist, Culpeper
explained juniper.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:28.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It is a solar shrub, it is
hot to the third degree.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For that reason it's incredibly
good when you need to bring

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.292 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
warmth into the
digestive system.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:37.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's a very good carminative,
it's also a very strong diuretic

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:41.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but if you're trying to avoid
any excessive heat this would be

00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:45.104 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
very aggravating to pitta
condition and Ayurveda.

00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:49.341 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is too hot, so for example
in a kidney inflammation,

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
although this is an incredible
natural antibiotic and diuretic,

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:57.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it's very hot and irritating
at it can actually increase

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:03.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
bleeding if used improperly and
so in that situation it might be

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
better to use other herbs.

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:09.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now juniper, you notice when you
come up to it it's got a very

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:13.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
protective personality, you
actually just touch the needle

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:16.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they are
pricking right into you.

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:19.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And interestingly enough, this
herb is used around the world

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from Northern Europe to Native
America to India not only to

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
cleanse and protect the physical
body from sort of resistant

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
bacterial but also to sort of
protect the astral body or the

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:38.257 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
spirit or the essence
of the being as well.

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So that's an interesting
crossover and that's something

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:44.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
really exciting happening in our
age, is that we are seeing these

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
overlapping systems such as
Ayurveda, Native American

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.404 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
medicines, European traditional
healing and so we are able to

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
see like wow this is how
this was used around the world.

00:22:56.442 --> 00:23:01.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Herbalist have always way back
in the day chewed this berry

00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:05.851 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
here to protect themselves from
taking on any of the sort of

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
plagues of their patients.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But the main thing to remember
with juniper is that it's hot.

00:23:11.991 --> 00:23:14.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's great for vata and
kapha doshas but it's very

00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:16.395 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
aggravating to pitta.

00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:21.467 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When we're talking about
hot, we're talking also about

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:24.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
antibiotic
qualities found in garlic.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
antibiotic
qualities found in garlic.

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:29.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now garlic is something that we
all generally have access to and

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:34.313 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
people are very familiar with
garlic, but this plant, this

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:39.285 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
bulb, the part that's used most
commonly for infection is active

00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:43.322 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
against both gram positive
and gram negative bacteria.

00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:47.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So garlic is also used for
fighting candida albicans,

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:50.996 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
cancer, fatigue, high blood
pressure, high cholesterol,

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
heart disease. In Ayurveda

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:56.368 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it's very well-known for the
fact that it's lacking only one

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:59.238 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
taste and that is sour.

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:03.942 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It contains almost all six
tastes and that says a lot from

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a therapeutic perspective.

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:09.081 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So garlic can be used topical
for like ring worm conditions

00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:12.518 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
any kind of fungal condition in
the body, it's incredibly good

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:13.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
for.

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:17.856 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But again, it is a pitta herb
and very aggravating this was

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
not allowed in the
monastery for example.

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:23.862 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is an herb that we
generally all have in our homes

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:28.434 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and we have access to for
addressing lung infections, any

00:24:28.434 --> 00:24:31.337 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
sort of stomach
upset, very helpful.

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:35.174 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We would also want to
call upon bentonite clay.

00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:39.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Bentonite clay has an incredible
ability to sort of sop up toxins

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:44.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and stop the process of
dysentery in its tracks.

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's very good as
anti-inflammatory and has been

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
used in traditional
cultures around the world.

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We'll see animals often eating
clay when they are not feeling

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.894 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
well or if they are lacking
nutrients. Not only is clay

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:59.331 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
filled with minerals but it has
an ability to fight infections

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and inflammations.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Clay can be seen how magically
it works if you have a cut or

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
almost like an infected bite.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:09.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you wet the clay and make a
paste out of it and put it on

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:14.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that bite what you will notice
is that it draws out the toxins

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or the infection in the bite.

00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It will do the same internally
and it will pass through in

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
stool.

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:26.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So clay, garlic, juniper,
other herbs such as sage, thyme,

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:31.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
oregano, all spice, rosemary,
these are all herbs we can use

00:25:31.163 --> 00:25:34.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
as natural
alternatives to antibiotics.

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:37.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now if we combine that again
with things like beneficial

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:42.508 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
bacteria and understanding
ferments and how to make sure

00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:45.411 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that our hydrochloric acid
is present, we are a lot less

00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
susceptible to infection.

00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:52.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we have in this Boreal
forest around us an incredible

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:55.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
medicine chest of natural
antibiotics that are there for

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:59.024 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
us to use, they're free and
accessible, they should be used

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:03.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with awareness and cautiously
because they are medicines but

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.531 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they are medicines that
work and that we can call on.

00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:09.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And as we head into this new era
where antibiotics are challenged

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:13.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
by ever evolving super bugs, we
need to look to these plants and

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:17.042 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
keep them close at hand and
understand how to use them

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:18.544 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
before we really have to.

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:25.484 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The plants are
here to help us, they provide us

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with life and we are
dependent upon them.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They too are living beings that
breathe, drink, eat, feel and

reproduce.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They offer us a chance to walk
in the sacred garden of life.

in the web of life
and miraculous cures.

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:09.728 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The guidance and healing we
receive when we act as both

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
students and stewards of nature
is more than the quality and

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:15.868 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
longevity of our own lives.

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:24.409 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is about the healing,
survival and evolution on all

levels.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:31.383 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is also about finding our
greater role as human beings,

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:36.722 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
serving the next generation and
caring for the world within and

00:27:36.722 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
around us.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:46.431 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
