I think youth are
really good for this if given a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
chance to explore, there is some
spark that is still alive and

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:37.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
well in most youth that is
calling for the wild, like the

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.365 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
call of the wild.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.904 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's calling for that
reconnection, it is the call to

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:47.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
wholeness, it is the call home
because the healing force of

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
nature is there and
it wants balance.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The challenging part is
sometimes balance comes in

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.785 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
pretty jarring forms.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
How do we reconnect?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
How do we come down 
from the highrise,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.127 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
put our feet

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:11.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
plant some seeds, learn what's
growing around us that we used

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:17.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to call weeds, so that we're
prepared for change and that

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
we're empowered.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%

really poor, we're never really

almost become orphans in the
sense that our rational minds

are with comfrey or symphytum

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:55.162 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
officinale and when you watch
this plant grow in the spring,

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.632 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
one thing that stands out about
it is that it's extremely fast

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and its leaves get
extremely large.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:05.238 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What we're looking at here is a
very small specimen of comfrey.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mainly what this plant is known
for is regenerating tissues so

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
much so that you don't want to
use it where there's a situation

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.184 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of a wound that is infected
because it will get cell

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:21.721 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
proliferation actions happening
so fast that you're not able to

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.024 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
get the infection
out of the wound.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:27.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So you always want to make sure
that the tissue itself is fairly

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
clean and there's no infection
at which point you can use

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
comfrey in a poultice.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:37.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The root used traditionally its
names are knit bone for example,

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:44.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
bone set, it is used for
regenerating tissues even at

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:47.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
level of the bone,
regenerating bone.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it's not surprising that
this plant is and incredible

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
regenerator.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.489 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The root has been used for
regenerating any inflamed and

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
degenerated tissues,
the bowels, the lungs...

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.861 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
throughout history, it's been
used with other herbs such as

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:06.933 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
elecampane for healing really
deep seeded infections of

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the lungs or inflammations
of the lungs.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:14.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So you really don't want to use
this plant without thinking when

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
considering that there is
some controversy over it but any

look into the books, the history

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
books, this plant 
has been used safely

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
for 100s of years...

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
known as an
incredible wound healer.

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:47.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's used on burns, cuts,
scrapes, all kinds of abrasions,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:51.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's a disinfectant but at the
same time it stimulates new cell

growth.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's a very healing plant.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:58.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's usually the flower that's
used and it's often made into

00:06:58.051 --> 00:06:59.319 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
ointment.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This ointment is made by a local
herbalist River City Herbals,

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:08.728 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but it looks basically,
it's a salve meets an ointment.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's basically the calendula
soaked in some sort of oil and

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:15.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
mixed with some beeswax that can
be applied to dry irritated skin

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.972 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
or any kind of burn or cut.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:23.777 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Also you notice from looking at
calendula, that it has a very

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:28.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
good, bright, very,
very bright color to it.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It contains some similar
compounds that you might find in

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.885 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
such things like carrots.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:36.423 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so the calendula is also
very good for the eyes as well.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:41.027 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This has traditionally
been used in cancer formulas.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:44.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you think about it, cancer
is type of rot, it's a type of

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
darkness in a way.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What you're trying to
bring to it is light, color,

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:54.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
antioxidants, a brightness
quality, a light force quality

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and calendula is
definitely all of those things.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So if we also consider that all
kinds of diseases are related to

inflammation, any herb

anti-inflammatory is 
extremely helpful for us

what's known as the Whiteshell

the center of North America
which is also referred to as

If we don't have a good
relationship spiritually to the

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
land and to our source
of creation, it affects

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
psychologically and if we're not
balanced psychologically, the

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
body becomes affected.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:02.976 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We all know what it's like if
we feel anxiety or if we feel

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:05.912 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
stress or depression.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:10.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If we feel anxiety or we feel
arousal or hunger because we see

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:15.822 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
something around us or we think
something, the body responds.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:19.592 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For example when we use a plant
to heal, let's say we use a

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:24.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
bitter plant like yarrow, this
bitter flavor goes in and this

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:30.136 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
medicine is very highly refined
and complex medicine that works

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:33.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in many ways in the body will
start to cleanse out the liver

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and one things that happen
when we cleanse the liver, is we

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
actually start to move stored
emotion and so part of healing

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:49.823 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
process is to actually move
and keep flow happening in body

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:55.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
where they might otherwise be
stuck emotional issues, grief,

00:09:55.161 --> 00:10:01.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
resentment, fear, these are all
stored in different areas of the

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:05.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
body and this is a traditional
understanding around the world

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that you can't separate the
health of body from the health

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
of the mind.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:12.145 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I find flower essences are very
good because

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:15.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
an awful lot of people have
shut down the forth heart chakra

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
because they have been wounded.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.787 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It can be jilted at a dance all
the way to an ugly divorce and

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that's where the problem
is. In the flower essences

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you can be able to open
heart but have it protected.

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:29.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Most people are scared to open
up the fourth chakra because

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.665 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they've been wounded and so
the yarrow, especially the pink

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:35.535 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
yarrow here, is the best
one for protecting the heart.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:40.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So what I use is a combination
borrage, pink yarrow and

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Alberta wild rose with the
other two yarrows,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
white yarrow and yellow
yarrow to create a protection.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.885 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And then if there are other joys
that need to be brought into

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:54.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
their life maybe buttercup
or selfheal or something along

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:57.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
those lines but that would
help protect so I'm giving the

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:05.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
physical reality of herbs and
then the flower essence is the

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
energizer.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.935 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If I have person who comes in
and has had a heart attack,

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:11.771 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can be throwing Hawthorn at
them and reishi at them and

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.341 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
coenzyme Q10 and all those
herbs,but they won't stick.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If the chakra's closed down,
there's not enough magnetic

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:19.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
energy to do that.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:22.282 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So I have to open that up, so I
need the flower essence to open

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:26.152 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that level up so they can have
a magnetic thing to attract the

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
herbs to.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.357 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And it's necessary and that's
just as true if it's the cancer

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of sexual organs. I need to
work on the second chakra and

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
thyroid, whatever.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But the center of gravity, well
you've got seven and the middle

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is four that would be the heart.
It is the place that we have to

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
center in and literally it's the
one for us to grow out of our

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:49.609 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
third ego chakra into our fourth
chakra so we can communicate

00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
with our head again.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:58.718 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Here we are
with motherwort.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:05.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Latin name for this plant is
Leonurus Cardiaca which says a

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:10.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
lot because one of its main uses
is for helping the heart, to

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
calm the heart, calm the nerves.

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:16.369 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's very commonly used in
heart palpitation situations.

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:22.008 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's also used along with other
herbs such as dong quai or dang

00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:26.846 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
gui in Chinese medicine to
regulate the menstrual cycle.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:30.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I know women that have also used
this for addressing hot flashes

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:35.088 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and if you look at this plant,
it's really not a surprise that

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's great for the heart because
it makes basically a perfect

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
cross.

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:42.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And if anyone's familiar
with heart chakra in eastern

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:45.798 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
medicine, they'll recognize
that the symbol is the perfect

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
balance of an upward and
downward triangle sort of joined

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
together and this cross
represents centered balance to

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
calm the heart.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's hard for the heart to be
calm when the mind is overly

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
active and so one of the main
ways that we use motherwort is

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to calm the nerves
and calm the mind.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:15.028 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We use motherwort also in
situations where we want high

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:18.164 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
over functioning thyroids
because the thing about

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:23.169 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
hyperthyroidism is that it's
often accompanying hyper active

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
adrenal situations or a
personalities that are really

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.442 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
stuck in fight or
flight responses its seems.

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:33.246 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A person who is coming at their
lives from a very stressful

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:36.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
point, is that the adrenal's get
exhausted over time

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with cortisol production and
adrenaline production. 

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.921 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The adrenal and the thyroid
work really closely together.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Ultimately, all the glands are
working really closely together.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:50.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So if we want to calm the
thyroid down, motherwort is very

00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:53.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
helpful in combination with
plants such as bugleweed and

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:56.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
lemon balm. But we have to
consider how a person is

00:13:56.903 --> 00:14:00.773 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
relating to their life, what
their breathing patterns are,

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:03.109 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
what their eating patterns
are and whether they're using

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
stimulates and how they're
relating to their life.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:09.348 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So when it comes to any sort
of issues of calming the heart,

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:13.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which in Chinese medicine is
very closely associated with the

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
state of the mind or addressing
thyroid issues, menopausal

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.394 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
issues, blood flow issues,
we can call on the this not

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:24.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
surprisingly named
plant, motherwort.

Here we are with the
magnificent Angelica or Dong

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.076 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Quai.

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This plant is primarily known as
a fertility tonic and a general

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
overall tonic.

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:46.953 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
As you can see, it's very
strong, from the color of its

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:50.857 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
reddish hue, it's not surprising
that it's also a blood builder.

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's used in cases of anemia,
in cases of hair loss, or

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
dizziness, tinnitus,
heart palpitations.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:04.403 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When we're talking about in
other areas in this film, we're

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
talking about the importance
of agnee or digestive function.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.047 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In Ayurveda, the sexual energy
or ging energy in Chinese or in

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Daoist traditions,

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:19.352 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in Ayurveda traditions it's
referred to as ojas.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:23.956 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now, ojas transforms into
agni energy and agni energy

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:31.831 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
transforms from there into shen
energy. So it goes from sexual 

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:35.368 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
energy to pure chi and
then it gets transformed into

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:36.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
consciousness.

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:38.905 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So when we're working with
sexual tonics, we're not just

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:43.576 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
looking to stimulate. for men
for example there's other herbs

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:47.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
out there like damiana as a yang
tonic or there's horny goat weed

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:51.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for example, muira puama, 
yohimbe, they're all incredible.

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:54.987 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But really from a holistic
perspective, what you're trying

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:59.292 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to do is nurture the body and
you don't want to overdo it.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So when you're talking about
nurturing the body, when I say

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:06.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
overdoing it. I mean, use
that energy up right away.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:11.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Examples of tonics would
be like, for men and women

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:16.108 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
ashwagandha though ashwagandha
is an Indian herb, it's usually

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:21.447 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
used for males in India and
around the world now but it can

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.249 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
also be used for females.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:27.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's a tonic for the adrenals,
it's a tonic for the thyroid,

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:32.391 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
overall nurturing for the body,
health will equate to sexual

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
energy and vibrancy so we need
to embrace that as part of a

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
holistic program.

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.034 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Another commonly known one is
Siberian ginseng, this is known

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:45.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to increase the performance
of athletes, increase immune

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:48.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
function, and all of these
things are tied together.

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There are studies out of Russia
where workers can get a lot more

00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
done in a day, they can function
sharper on a mental level.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
All of these can be traced back
to a certain ging or ojas energy

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
in the body.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.457 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But the important thing to
remember when we're talking

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:08.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
about these tonics is that the
point is not just to increase

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:15.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the sexuality urge but to use
that within the nervous system

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:18.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to keep the body healthy, keep
the immune system functioning

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:18.938 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
well.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:24.176 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When we're talking about
hormonal balancers for females,

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:27.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
dong quai would be used
alongside other herbs like

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:30.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
chaste tree berry or vitex
which is an incredible hormone

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:31.284 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
balancer.

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Women can also use red clover
which I speak about commonly and

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.958 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
use commonly.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:44.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We can also use
this alongside maca.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Maca is known as a Peruvian
ginseng and they give it to

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.368 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
young couples to
increase their fertility.

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:53.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Again, it's a root, it's
a tonic, and it's full of

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
nourishment.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But if we're going to talk about
a holistic system of healing, we

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
embrace this sexual energy for
we also use that for vitality

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:05.217 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and chi within the body, moving
it with breath and exercise and

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:09.522 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
ideally bringing it up to the
brain and having

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:12.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it sort of bloom.
In this case, you see angelica..

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:17.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's very strong stalk, very
strong  body, very strong root

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which is usually what's used for
the medicine, is the root.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But then, look at the flowers,
look how many seeds there are

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.505 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and look at the messages of it.

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:30.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's a very expansive herb, it's
very good for consciousness and

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
if you even think, about the
name angelica, what that might

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
mean, although it's also known
around the world as dong quai or

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.718 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
dang gui.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So we're talking about blood
tonics, we're talking about

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:46.592 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
fertility, we're talking about
sexual energy. But in an eastern

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:51.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
system of healing, to increase
sexual urge can actually lead to

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:56.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
more dis-ease if it's going in
the direction of lust because

00:18:56.302 --> 00:19:00.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
lust and greed are very similar
and when they talk about that in

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:05.378 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Tibetan medicine the three main
causes of dis-ease are greed,

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
hatred and ignorance.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.049 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So that might sound like what
does that have to do with the

00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:14.253 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
body but all of those equate to
feeling and energy in the body

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
affecting the whole body
just like any type of stress or

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.557 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
emotion affects the body.

00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:23.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So when we're talking about
sexual tonics, the ideal place

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to take that energy to a place
of love, devotion and bliss.

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:31.637 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And so these tonics are
often used alongside oil like

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.774 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
sandalwood or rose for example.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:38.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, even in pregnancy tonics for
people who can't conceive you

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:43.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
will often see them used
alongside herbs or essences,

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:49.522 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
essential oils like sandalwood.
Like rose, things that are very

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:54.427 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sattvic, sweet, they bring that
sexual energy up into the heart

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:59.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from there, from that chi center
that promise center, that vital

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
energy and that softness bliss
energy, it can come up

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:10.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
into the brain and we can have
transcendent awareness

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.578 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
experiences that are very
healing not just for the

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:15.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
individual but for
the whole planet.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:19.185 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is where we take a magic
bullet question how do I get

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:22.788 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
pregnant or how do I increase my
libido and we understand it more

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:26.559 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
holistically and we can see the
potential not just for libido

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:30.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but to other levels
of experience as well.

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:33.833 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So the desire to merge on
the physical level can be

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
transformed to the desire to
merge on the heart level and can

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:40.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
be the desire to merge on
the divine level as well and

00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:43.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
angelica is incredible
representation of the holistic

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
plant that has all
of those qualities.
