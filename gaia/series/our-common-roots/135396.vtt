00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:11.271 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
Ayurveda is said to be 
at least 5,000 years old.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.407 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It's a very, very
old system.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's still functioning
and it's still refining.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The vedic sciences are really
about prolonging life they go in

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:28.488 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
part with Ayurveda is for the
body, we also have yoga for the

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
spirit and we have
tantra for the mind.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All of these are focusing on
balance, peace and harmony.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:42.669 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ayurveda, the science of health
and longevity

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:46.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is the ancient 
healing system of India.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
♪♪  Music  ♪♪

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.317 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Much like Chinese
medicine and other forms of

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
traditional healing, it can be
traced back thousands of years.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:17.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These systems see the body as a
complete garden and not simply a

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
machine made of parts.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Like the rest of nature the
body is comprised of the primary

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.294 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
elements of water,
air, earth and fire.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
All of these elements are
interacting within the element

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of ether or space.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:58.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Each element is interwoven with
the functioning of the body, the

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:03.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
mind and their many
processes or states.

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:10.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
According to Ayurveda, the
science of health and longevity,

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:15.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we are all a unique balance
of these elements which they

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:18.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
categorize into
three types or doshas.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Depending on our dosha type.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We will be dominated by fire and
water known as pitta, earth and

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:34.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
water known as kapha or
air and ether known as vata.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:38.351 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Everything in nature, including
different plants will fall into

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
these same categories.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:47.227 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Each category or elemental
nature a plant represents and

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
thus its effect on the body
can be categorized by its taste,

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:54.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
color and smell.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:04:01.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
For example, vata can be
recognized in the bitter flavor,

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.479 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
pitta in the pungent
and kapha in the sweet.

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:14.488 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Where we live, our sleeping
patterns, hobbies, diet,

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:19.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
vocations, emotions and so on 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.596 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
all affect our dosha balance.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The goal in traditional medicine
is to find elemental harmony or

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:32.172 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
constitutional balance
and thus avoid disease.

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If a garden gets moldy or
overtaken by a fungus due to its

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
lack of drainage or excess water
element, or its lack of exposure

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:45.886 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to wind and sun, it will do
little good to spray a chemical

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:46.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
on it.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:51.324 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
One must look at the balance
of the elements, which one is

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.727 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
lacking and which
one is in excess.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.598 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Traditional systems seek to
balance the body and mind via

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:03.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
diet, herbs and lifestyle
using the same ancient system of

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.171 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
elements.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:08.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Each element can be used
to balance the others.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:13.713 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is a holistic system
that embraces the micro and the

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.218 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
macro, the
environment and the individual.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.768 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So one of the old time 
herbalists, by the name of 

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:38.939 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Culpeper spoke about a plant,
named Rosemary as a 

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:45.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
way to bring in warmth in any 
coldness disease.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:48.682 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now, we have to remember that
the digestive function, the

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:52.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
stomach, the fire in the stomach
is really our first line of

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
defense and it's also what
makes sure that we're properly

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:00.627 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
breaking down food and that the
damp-warm conditions of body do

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not get overtaken by yeast
and sort of flem and mucus and

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.768 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
become really hospitable to
let's say parasites and harmful

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:09.669 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
bacteria.

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:14.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, when we're talking about
bringing warmth, rosemary is one

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.776 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of the best herbs that
we can use for that.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Rosemary helps to cleanse the
liver out and increase the flow

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:26.686 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of bile through the liver which
of course helps in digestion.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:30.924 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But it also as we know has an
incredibly antiseptic property.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:34.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This used to be burned as smudge
during times like the plague or

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
in hospitals to cleanse the air.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:43.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's used to, what Culpeper
says to bring brightness where

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.671 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
there's dull sight.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now the sight is closely related
to the Agni function in Ayurveda

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
or fire element.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now if we get too much dampness,
yeast or overgrowth conditions

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in the body, we
start to lose that Agni.

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:01.454 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So it's very important that we
use plants like rosemary in our

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:06.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
cooking along with many others
like oregano, thyme, ginger or

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
allspice.

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.563 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
These are all very helpful
for bringing that warmth to the

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.198 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
digestive function.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This plant happens to also be
used for clearing the mind and

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:20.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is said to be the one that is
used in ancient Greece where you

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.676 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
see the wreaths
around people's hair.

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:27.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It brings circulation to the
brain and there are studies that

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it stimulates certain areas
of the brain that may really

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
benefit in conditions like ADD.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But again, even though we're
talking about digestion and

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:39.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
immunity, we're also talking
about clarity of mind because if

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:44.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Agni or digestive fire is
not strong, we run into dampness

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:48.034 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
conditions from sinus
infections to foggy mind.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:51.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So these things like rosemary,
these herbs that bring that

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:58.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
strong digestive ability,
keep the blood clean as a result

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:02.816 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because if the food is not
digesting properly, then we end

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:06.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
up with putrefying food
instead of digesting food.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.723 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Other herbs that are used
that way for example are this

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Artemisia or wormwood.

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.328 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is named after the
goddess of the moon, Artemisia.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.965 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now, interestingly enough, this
is used in most anti parasitic

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:19.899 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
formulas.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There are many who believe
parasites are the main cause of

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
many of our serious
degenerative diseases.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:30.076 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Most people have parasites,
it's to what degree your immune

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:33.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
system has to
constantly keep things in check.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:38.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Herbs like Artemisia or wormwood
are used to fight parasites and

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
also to increase digestive
function and fight off dampness

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
or yeast conditions in the body.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:49.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, interestingly enough, this
herb being named after Artemisia

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:56.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the goddess of the moon, it's
said that parasites mainly breed

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:59.873 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or multiply and have the largest
effect on the body and on the

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.509 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
personality
during the full moon.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:05.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And if you talk to anyone who
works in an emergency room, they

00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
will testify to that.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:10.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So there's an interesting
connection there, definitely a

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:11.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
fascinating plant.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.654 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If you taste this, this is
by far one of the most bitter

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:16.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
plants that we have available.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:21.728 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So it is an apparatif, it does
get the stomach juices flowing,

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the hydrochloric acid is one
of our best defenses against

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:28.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
candida, yeast and all
kinds of digestive over growth

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.369 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
conditions.

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So this bitter flavor remember
is like blowing on a fire, the

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
fire being the digestive system.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:39.546 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Bitter is air and so what we're
doing when chew this before we

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
eat is bringing in
the air element.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:45.452 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now if we add to that good
proper traditional ferments and

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:48.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
foods that are high in
beneficial bacteria and then

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.623 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we're getting in our
glyconutrients, we're really in

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:54.527 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a good position to not have a
stressed out immune function.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:59.666 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, another plant that I'd like
to talk about on this topic is

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
calamus also
known as sweet flag.

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now the number of uses for this
plant are phenomenal but it is

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.576 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
in a lot of digestive formulas.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:12.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Around the world you'll hear
about Swedish bitters, or you'll

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.781 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
hear about Canadian
bitters, Chinese bitters.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Bitters get the digestive
function going, they fight

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:22.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
dampness, yeast, fungal
conditions in the body so

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
calamus is used for everything
from sinus infections, poor

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
digestion, diabetes, fungal
overgrowth, this is also used to

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.167 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sharpen the mind so again we
see that connection between the

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:38.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
digestive fire and a clear
system that when food is

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
digesting properly and the body
is not bogged by yeast and other

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
pathogens.

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:49.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Calamus, if you look at it, it
also looks like a brain stem.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:52.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is one of the ways we can
also consider the doctrine of

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
signatures.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's a major
rejuvenative for the mind.

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.859 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So all of these plants, we
have to consider when we're

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
considering the immune system.

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.596 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The immune system and the
digestive system go hand in

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
hand, it's very dynamic.

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This is the purpose of
cleansing, this is the purpose

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.803 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of taking glyconutrients,
roots, and mushrooms.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We keep immune system high but
we also have to make sure we

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
have the right amount of
hydrochloric acid, bile moving

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:22.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
enzymes because we're eating
live foods, we're not eating

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
foods designed for shelf life.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All of those things are what
create a good immune system.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If we add in mediation and
exercise, now we're talking and

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
together we have a more holistic
perspective of which herbs are

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
an essential part.

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:44.237 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:48.641 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Here we are with
verbascum thapsus also known as

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:52.045 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
mullein, commonly known as
rabbits' ear for how soft its

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.246 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
leaves are.

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:56.115 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
From feeling the leaves and
the flower, you immediately

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:59.185 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
understand how incredibly
soothing this plant is.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:03.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's very comforting and also by
noticing where it grows, you can

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
tell it really likes flow.

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:08.962 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It likes the flow of water, and
that's exactly what it's used

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
for, both of those reasons.

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:15.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It decreases stagnation in the
lungs, so in the lungs it's used

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as an expectorant when there's
lung congestion, it's also very

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
soothing to lung tissue.

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:26.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the lymphatic system, it also
moves congested lymph as well.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:29.983 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Lymph, when we're talking about
the lymphatic system, it's not

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.952 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
just a physical thing, it's
connected to the heart, there's

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:35.722 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
no pump for the lymphatic
system, it's connected to the

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:36.756 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
emotions.

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:39.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So mullein's not just working
on a physical level, it's also

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
helping on an emotional level.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The flowers are used along
with calendula which is an

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:49.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
anti-inflammatory as well as
garlic and olive oil and St.

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:53.039 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
John's Wort which is an anti-
inflammatory and anti-viral.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Both of those are anti-virals.

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Together, all of those
things and an ear oil are highly

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:02.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
affective for ear
infections and ear aches.

00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:05.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I've used it for many
years now very successfully.

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:10.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So when I think about plants
that help move lung congestion

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:15.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or address lung issues we
immediately think of other herbs

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
like licorice which is one of
the most incredible herbs in the

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.265 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
planet.

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It cleanses all 12 meridians in
the body, it's very soothing,

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:26.873 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and it's a natural
alternative to steroidal drugs.

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:30.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Another incredible natural
alternative to steroidal drugs

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:33.813 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
people might know more from
legend and from church is

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.915 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
frankincense.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Frankincense is also
known as boswellia.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:43.022 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Boswellia is an incredible
anti-inflammatory for all kinds

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of conditions.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:49.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're talking about IBS
condition, Crohn's, colitis,

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:53.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we're talking about inflammatory
conditions like asthma.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:58.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This will work when we're
addressing inflammation in the

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
body of all kinds whether
it's osteoarthritis rheumatoid

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:06.345 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
arthritis, asthma,
IBS as I mentioned.

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:10.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But, when we're talking about
inflammation and we're talking

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:15.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about allergies, IBS and asthma,
we have to talk about emotions

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.726 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because all of the pent up
emotional energy creates heated

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:26.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
internal responses, overactive
systems to food allergens, to

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:30.169 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
things that would not normally
bother the digestive tract or

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.072 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the respiratory tract so a lot
of people find their issues get

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
worse with stress.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.944 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They're suddenly responding
to lectins in the food very

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:42.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
negatively, to gluten, to dairy,
to things that they wouldn't

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
normally have problems with.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:47.086 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So when we're looking at
addressing these kinds of

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
issues, we're looking at
not just how do we calm the

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.794 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
inflammation but we're also
looking at how do we calm the

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:59.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
emotions, how do we vent
emotions, how do we address flow

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:04.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the body because we're also
looking at keeping the blood

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:08.875 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
clean, if we're trying to avoid
arthritis, if we're trying to

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:11.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
have a good digestive system,
we're talking about all of those

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:14.781 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
things around digestive
tonics that we covered.

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.518 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So this is a holistic concept
again, mullein is an incredible

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:22.288 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
ally that we can call upon,
these fuzzy rabbit's ears are

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:27.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
found all over the wild and
they're free and they're willing

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to help and they're
definitely a give of nature.

♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I know you've
written books on mind body

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:42.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
medicine and one of the things
that I really find fascinating

00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:46.946 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I see with my clients is a
lot of people who are living in

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
their heads and not really
knowing how to manage the stress

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they're experiencing ending
up with auto immune problems.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:16:02.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Absolutely, it's increasing 
more auto immune diseases.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It used to be considered an
anomaly for a person to have

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:07.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
more than one
auto immune disease.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the last couple of years,
I've had several patients that

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
have had more than one which
is theoretically impossible.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:16.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I still think the number one
major thing is personal stresses

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:18.778 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and how a person
addresses themselves.

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:22.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In our society, we're taught
mentally but we're only taught a

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
little bit physical and
we're not trained emotionally.

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So those emotional stresses are
still the things that I think

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:32.391 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
are driving the auto
immune things the most.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If you want to go back to the
grassroots, still the number one

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
most important
thing is meditation.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:41.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Again, my base herb would
definitely be the mushrooms,

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:44.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because the mushrooms especially
reishi in this case, because

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.671 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
reishi literally...

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.375 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
there's a whole classification
of medicine in Chinese medicine

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.078 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to protect an academic from
their own brain when they think

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:54.447 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
too much and reishi is kind of
the king or that, kind of the

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
emperor of that if you want.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.118 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So we have talked
about a lot of herbs thus far

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:02.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and I would like to talk
about a very special mushroom.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:07.026 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Here in this clinic, we use
this probably more than other

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:11.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
medicine and it is
reishi mushroom.

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
While chaga mushroom is
considered the king of the herbs

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:19.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of Siberia, reishi mushroom is
truly the king of herbs of Asia.

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:24.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This plant as you can see by
looking at it according to the

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:28.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
doctrine of signatures is
really good for the heart.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Reishi mushroom can be used for
high blood pressure, cholesterol

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but is also used for all
kinds of stress and hyperactive

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.556 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
conditions.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:41.961 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You may consider that an
overactive mind so it's said to

00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:46.499 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
save the academic from their
mind or people who are too much

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:51.637 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in their brains, insomniacs who
can't stop thinking, paranoia,

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:52.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
it's used...

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:55.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
very valuable in that situation.

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:58.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's also considered to be
calming to central nervous

00:17:58.277 --> 00:17:59.545 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
system.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:05.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This mushroom is one of our best
allies for calming over active

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:07.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
vata or air element.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now, there being a lot of nerve
impulses and mental activity,

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:15.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's really important to realize
that mushrooms are closer in DNA

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:19.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
structure to animals
than they are to plants.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Another fascinating thing is
that if you could see below this

00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:27.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
fruiting body into the earth,
mushrooms have a whole network

00:18:27.073 --> 00:18:32.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of mycelium and those mycelium
have the same sort of pattern in

00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:35.948 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
nature as our neural net in our
own brains, and even the

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:36.916 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
dark matter in space,

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so it's really
interesting to see these

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:43.522 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
patterns in nature repeating
themselves over and over again.

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So reishi is considered to be
not only grounding and calming

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.398 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but it can be used in such
situations as cancer, it can be

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
used in all kinds of infections.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So if you have overactive immune
system, it will calm it down and

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if you have an underactive
immune system, it will raise it

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:01.574 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
up.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That's thought to be due to the
water soluble polysaccharides in

00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:09.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
reishi mushroom.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:14.286 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We usually use this as a
tincture here at the clinic

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:18.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which is really effective,
generally starting at a low dose

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:22.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because it really is a great
detoxifier that really helps the

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.629 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
liver do its job.

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:28.267 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Research on it suggests that it
helps the body's production of

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.969 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
superoxide dismutase or

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:35.674 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
SOD which is one of our main
antioxidants and detoxifiers of

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:39.178 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the body, helps us break down
and get rid of all kinds of

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
things like pesticides from
the environment for example.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:46.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So the reishi can also be used
in a tea, traditionally it was

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:52.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
made into a decoction but
it's used for also an adaptogen.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:56.595 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Adaptogen is a crucial word
for us in this time because it's

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
really helping people to resist
stress, not only emotional

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
stress, but also environmental
stress, long term functioning

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
under a lot of pressure.

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:12.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It modulates the adrenal
function so it can be used not

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
only for fighting infections but
also for generally strengthening

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
people.

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:21.253 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When you look at such texts as
Terry Willard's text book which

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:24.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is a wonderful text from
Wild Rose, you'll see that the

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:30.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Chinese character for reishi
mushroom is deep forest, three

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:34.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
months of rain
Shaman special mushroom.

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, what that's telling you is
that it has this sort of quality

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.173 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that was not only used for
physical health which is

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
obviously very important, but it
has a mystical quality as well

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that you can see in some of
its traditional folk names,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
miraculous chi herb is a
traditional folk name of reishi

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:56.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
mushroom as is herb of spiritual
potency, so is happy herb,

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
longevity herb...

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:03.229 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So this is an A+ tonic, its
safety rating is gold, you just

00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:07.199 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
have to watch out how fast you
go up to what dosage, there can

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
be some detox reactions and it's
good to look into that before

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.337 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
you use it.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.574 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But if I was to choose just one
herb that is nonlocal to me, it

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
would have to be
reishi mushroom.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.514 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When you look into the research
on this plant it really is

00:21:21.514 --> 00:21:25.117 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
incredible, it almost sounds
like a snake oil because east

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and west, the studies that have
been done on it are incredible

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:32.358 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and there's so much more to
learn but its uses are so

00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:37.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
diverse, from asthma, high blood
pressure, cholesterol, auto

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:42.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
immune situations, stress,
anxiety, knots in the chest, the

00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
list goes on and on.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Definitely look further into
this herb if you are interested,

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it's one of our best allies.

So in your

00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
entitled greeting your green
community and really that page

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:23.842 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is designed to help you develop
a relationship with plants

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:29.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that's not just about text books
and laboratory information.

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:34.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Our ancestors around the world
used various methods of just

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:37.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
being with the plants,
tasting it, watching it in its

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.559 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
environment to understand what
its qualities were going to be.

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:45.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This plant here for example is
known as wormwood Artemisia.

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:50.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In the spring, it's one of
the very first plants up and

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:54.306 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
traditionally around the world,
you'll see that the plants that

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
come up first are bitter
plants after a winter.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.748 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so what that's really doing
is enkindling our digestive

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
system and helping cleanse our
body of parasites and fungus

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.424 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
overgrowth from the dampened
digestive system that happens

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:15.761 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
over the winter months when
we tend to be less active and

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:18.364 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
eating quite a bit
of food in general.

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, wormwood, you can learn
about it just by tasting it.

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:29.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The bitter flavor if we remember
studying our elements, the

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:30.909 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
bitter flavor is
the air element.

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:33.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And what that really does is
that it's kind of like blowing

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
on the digestive fire.

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:39.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So if we think about digestive
system as a fire, this very

00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:44.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
bitter element here, will help
that digestive system get going.

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:48.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
From a modern physiological
perspective what that's doing is

00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:52.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's actually getting our
hydrochloric acid moving, it's

00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:56.535 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
getting our bile moving, it's
getting our digestive system

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
going as a whole.

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:02.541 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Traditionally, they just saw
it as a bitter and they noticed

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.477 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that after they ate it, their
stomach would start gurgling.

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:08.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So that's an example of how we
might learn from a plant just

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:09.915 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
from being with it.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:13.319 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
With this same plant, we can
notice that nothing really feeds

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:14.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
on it.

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:19.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
No parasites feed on this plant,
no bugs really eat this plant so

00:24:19.258 --> 00:24:23.629 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
when you taste it and you
realize that, at the same time,

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:27.499 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it's not a big stretch to
understand that this plant in

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:30.869 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
itself would be a good remedy
for parasites and infections.

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:36.842 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The bitter flavor we have to
remember is the vata dosha in

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
Ayurveda.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.912 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What that means
is that it cools.

00:24:39.912 --> 00:24:45.651 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Vata is cold and so we can use
this topically for all kinds of

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:50.322 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
things for any kind of
inflammatory condition or any

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
kind of infestation or
yeast or fungal overgrowth.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:58.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That would be one way of looking
at this particular plant and

00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
then check the textbooks to make
yourself more comfortable with

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.469 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
that information.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.707 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Along those lines, we can
also look towards plantain, but

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:12.644 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
plantain is actually known as
white man's foot as its folk

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:16.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
name and plantain is said to
grow wherever the white men

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:17.349 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
went.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.486 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And part of the reason is that
we would take it with us as a

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
medicine.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's a potent antibiotic and
it's an incredible healer of all

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
kinds of wounds and abrasions.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:33.098 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Plantain, if you notice, being
with it and you watch it in its

00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:39.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
environment, not only can it
grow in very dry places like

00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
very gravely parking lots and
dry environments, it manages to

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
suck the moisture out
of the ground to thrive.

00:25:48.614 --> 00:25:52.518 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, right there you understand
that plantain has an incredible

00:25:52.518 --> 00:25:56.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
drawing ability and the
herbalists of old understood

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:59.992 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that about plantain and they
would use it to draw infections

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:04.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
out of cuts, they'd roll up
plantain leaves and stick them

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:07.533 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in sockets of teeth to
draw out infection as well.

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So there's many different ways
that it can cool and draw and

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
address infectious issues.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Another thing you might notice
from being with plantain is that

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:20.345 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it goes wherever
the earth is wounded.

00:26:20.813 --> 00:26:25.818 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So if a path gets worn or a
driveway gets cleared, one of

00:26:25.818 --> 00:26:28.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the very first plants to
come in will be plantain.

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.057 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's much like aloe, we
don't have aloe growing in this

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
northern hemisphere but plantain
follows a lot of the same laws

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.729 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
as the aloe vera.

00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:40.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We can also imagine
being with a burdock.

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's a very mighty and strong,

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:46.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
almost intimidatingly size plant

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:50.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We know now that burdock is
incredibly nutritious and it's a

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:53.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
desmutagen which helps to
remove toxins from the body.

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:58.517 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But in days gone past, we would
just spend time with that plant

00:26:58.517 --> 00:27:02.187 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and we would recognize that it
is incredibly strong, it's very

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:06.158 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
good at multiplying
and it's very big.

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:10.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so if you see a person
that's depleted, you would use

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the plant that's kind
of the balance of that.

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:16.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You would use the plant
that brings that energy.

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:21.874 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the same sense, if you find
somebody that's very aggravated

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:26.812 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you would use a chamomile plant
or a pineapple weed which often

00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
grows around here as well.

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Pineapple weed, if you
smell it, it's very sweet.

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:38.156 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's the opposite of big and
aggravated sort of personality.

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:42.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Pineapple weed is very sweet,
very humble and very calm it's

00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:44.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
very soft.

00:27:44.196 --> 00:27:49.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In that sense pineapple weed and
chamomile bring a really soft

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
energy to a
person who's agitated.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Or in Aryuveda, would be
called rajasic

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:59.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We can also look at the smell
of a rose the same way and how

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:01.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
someone might use rose
essential oil or lavender.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:06.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When we look at plants in this
way, what we're doing is we're

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:09.087 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
thinking more intuitively
and more meditatively.

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:13.158 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When we combine that with our
laboratory information 

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.526 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and our text books.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.763 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it's incredibly powerful and we
have to remember there's still

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:20.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
things yet to learn
that we may not already know and

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.569 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
haven't been
discovered in laboratories yet.

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:28.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The rishis of ancient India, the
wise people of Europe, those are

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:31.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the ways that they used to learn
about nature and learn about

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:36.248 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
plants is they would spend time
in nature which no matter what

00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:37.583 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
is good for us.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And try to intuit and try
to learn about the plants.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Sometimes they would drink a
tea of that plant and feel its

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:48.794 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
effects on the body, sometimes
they would eat very little and

00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:51.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
just take in that plant and see
if they would have a dream about

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:52.931 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
it.

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:56.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
All of these kinds of things are
nonlinear ways of learning about

00:28:56.234 --> 00:29:01.673 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
plants because we spend a lot
of time today online, on the

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:05.577 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
internet or researching
textbooks and I think if we

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:08.847 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
really want to be fully
empowered, we need to recognize

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:12.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
our body and these plants have
been living together for 100s of

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:16.822 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
1,000s of years and we have a
relationship already that we

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:20.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
really just need to remember and
there's ways of learning about

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:25.063 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
plants that are not commonly
used today and are a bit in

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:25.998 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
jeopardy.

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:30.369 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A lot of herbs
we know are considered weeds by

00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:35.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
most people and so the things
that are growing on the property

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
like the nettles, the
burdocks, the rose hips...

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.246 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
are there certain
herbs that are sort of...

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
aside from the mushrooms that
really stand out for you that

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you have a core
relationship with?

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:50.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The barnyard, I call those the
barnyard herbs and fortunately

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.024 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I've got a barn in my
yard so I really like them.

00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:55.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Those barnyard herbs are the
sustainers, the dandelions, 

00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
the burdocks, the nettles as
you say.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They grow themselves? You betcha
And those are some of the best.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have a tea on the market
called

00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:09.207 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
The Detox Tea under uncle Lee

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it literally has those.
It has the red clover, the

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.146 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
burdock and the
dandelion, that's all it is.

00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:18.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But it's a real good base note
and it's a sustainable thing.

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's cleaning our liver and
it's cleaning our wood element,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.691 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in Chinese system. Those
ones that are growing wild...

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
So yes, what are the best herbs?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The ones that live around you,
those are the best herbs.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So you live in boreal forest,
you've got a great resource.

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:43.709 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:46.411 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Here we are with the most
beautiful red clover. 

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There are many types of clover.
There's white clovers,

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
pink clovers we
prefer to work with the red.

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The number of uses for this
plant are really incredible.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.222 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's very high in coumarins
which  are blood cleansers,

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:01.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
used in many  traditional cancer
formulas  very successfully.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:03.762 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's also used in menopause
formulas.

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:09.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It is a phytoestrogen. It is use
to take the edge off some of

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
menopausal symptoms due to low
estrogen levels.

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:16.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It also cleanses the liver and
gull bladder, not many people

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:19.377 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
know that we can use this
plant as an antifungal.

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:23.115 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's used in bronchial
conditions, irritated bronchial

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:25.817 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
nerves, you can put it in lung
formulas, for cleansing out the

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:27.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
lungs.

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So all around we primarily use
this not just as an incredibly

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:35.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
nutritive plant but also for
cleansing the blood which is a

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:36.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
foundation in
traditional healing.

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:39.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If you can keep the blood clean,
it's like keeping the river

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
clean.

00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:45.003 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Things don't fester, things
don't grow that are harmful for

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.271 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
the organism.

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:49.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Red clover is this incredible
ally when it comes to cleaning

00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:53.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the blood, cleansing the liver
and gall bladder out, cleaning

00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:56.882 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the lungs and addressing
serious issues such as tumors

00:31:56.882 --> 00:32:00.051 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and cancer in traditional
formulas such as the hoxsey

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:01.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
formula.

♪♪ Music ♪♪

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:13.298 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So here we are
with one of the most well-known

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:16.501 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
herbs in North
America, this is Echinacea.

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:21.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Echinacea has two main varieties
that not a lot of people know

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
about.

00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:25.076 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The one with the really
large cone top is the Echinacea

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:26.344 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
purpurea.

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:30.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is more common in Europe
and normally what's used here to

00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:33.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
get the active constituents
we're looking for its immune

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:35.821 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
benefits, we
would use the flower.

00:32:36.922 --> 00:32:41.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Whereas the Echinacea
that's local to North America,

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:44.496 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
angustifolia, it's the
root that we are after.

00:32:44.496 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is an incredibly hardy
plant, it's extremely drought

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
resistant.

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:54.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Echinacea has been used
throughout the centuries.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:57.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
First nations used it for
everything from snake bites to

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:01.046 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
infections of all kinds, it's
known to be an incredible blood

00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:02.314 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
cleanser.

00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:06.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
As a tincture, it's one of the
best topical remedies for poison

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
ivy of anything ever studied.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.992 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's also known as a cell
normalizer, so when it comes in

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:19.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
contact with abnormal cells, it
actually restores them to normal

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:21.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
functioning in a very
short period of time.

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:25.503 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's used quite commonly
for abnormal pap smears, in

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:29.474 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
suppositories, it is apparently
successful at that as well.

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:35.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So angustifolia, purpurea,
Echinacea is an incredible not

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:38.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
only beautiful plant but
source of glychonutrients.

00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:43.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So anyone studying the immune
system needs to understand about

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
glychonutrients.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They are protein sugars
that makeup the immune system.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Consider them like an alphabet
for the immune system that wants

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:52.764 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
to...

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:55.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when the immune system wants
to communicate with itself, it

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
needs a full alphabet.

00:33:57.302 --> 00:34:01.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because our diets in these
modern times are so focused on

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:06.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
shelf life and convenience,
we're really not getting the

00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:09.481 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
same nutrients that we normally
would from mushrooms, 

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:11.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from the roots, from the
berries, all the

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
things that our
ancestors were eating.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:17.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So really what we're looking for
in a lot of the immune boosting

00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:20.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
herbs are these glychonutrients.

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:24.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They also happen to be
high in polysaccharides.

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:29.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So glychonutrients are immensely
helpful for the immune function.

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:33.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So though this is one of many
plants used for increasing the

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:37.108 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
immune function, if we're going
to talk about immunity, we have

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:38.576 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to talk about the
bigger picture.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We're talking about stress
reduction, we're talking about

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:43.448 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
exercise, we're
talking about probiotics.

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:48.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Basically what most of our
system resides in our guts in

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
our bowels, in our stomachs.

00:34:50.622 --> 00:34:55.593 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Our stomachs are first line of
defense as is our skin and both

00:34:55.593 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of those areas should be highly
populated by beneficial bacteria

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that fight and protect the body.

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:07.639 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Acidophiolus bifidus, reuteri,
lactobacillus, a whole bunch of

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
different types and those we
find in

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:14.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
traditional fermented food
our miso, our sauerkrauts.

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The traditional ferments create
not only proper digestion but

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:24.155 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
also bring these beneficial
probiotics to our immune

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:24.622 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
function.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.392 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So if we're going to talk about
immunity, we can't just talk

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:29.327 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
about magic bullets like these.

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:33.698 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%

The plants are
here to help us, they provide us

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:39.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with life and we are
dependent upon them.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:50.115 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They too are living beings that
breathe, drink, eat, feel,

00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
and reproduce.

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:56.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They offer us a chance to walk
in the sacred garden of life.

00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:05.764 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:18%
"<i>glory</i>"
"<i>glory</i>"

00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:09.734 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
To feel the harmonic
blessing of creation. Our place

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:12.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the web of life
and miraculous cures.

00:36:14.806 --> 00:36:17.942 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The guidance and healing we
receive when we act as both

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.913 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
students and stewards of nature
is more than the quality and

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.082 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
longevity of our own lives.

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:32.624 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is about the healing,
survival and evolution on all

00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:33.825 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
levels.

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:39.597 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is also about finding our
greater role as human beings,

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:44.936 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
serving the next generation and
caring for the world within and

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:45.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
around us.

00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:54.646 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is the path of the plant
lover, the wild crafter
