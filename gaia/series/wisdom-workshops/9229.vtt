00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Military defenses
are absolutely incapable

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:84%
of defending any nation
and preserving the peace.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
We've got to address
violence at its roots.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We got to go to the poor
that neurophysiological,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
psychological roots of
violence and displace

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that enmity and difference
dominated perception

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
with the deeper, more profound,
and powerful reality of unity

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
by experiencing and
stimulating, and enlivening

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.702 align:middle line:84%
for the whole
society that unity,

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
which is the ultimate
truth of existence.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Agape.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a total delight for
me to address this renowned

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
congregation of enlightened
souls, awakened souls.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm very excited to share with
you a message that I think,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:10%
is very profound and
profoundly practical.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:10%
I would say a convergence
of science and spirit,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:10%
a scientific affirmation of
the fundamental unity of life

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:10%
and of existence, the scientific
discovery of a field of peace

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.915 align:middle line:10%
and a technology of peace.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
In the last century, 100 million
lives were lost due to war.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Since the United Nations was
founded after World War II

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the outbreak
of further conflict,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%
there have been 120 major wars.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Military defenses are absolutely
incapable of defending

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
any nation and
preserving the peace.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Even diplomacy,
what is it really?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Diplomacy is verbal
agreements among heads

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of state, paper agreements
among representatives of nation,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
not worth the paper the
agreements are written

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
on, as long as enmity and
violence still seethes

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
in the hearts of the
warring factions.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got to address
violence at its roots,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and we got to go to the core,
that neurophysiological,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
psychological roots of
violence, and displace

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that enmity in difference
dominated perception

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
with the deeper, more profound
and powerful reality of unity

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
by experiencing and
stimulating, and enlivening

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
for the whole
society that unity,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the ultimate
truth of existence.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing now, I think
is a scientific verification

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of the primacy of consciousness,
the fundamental role

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
plays in the universe.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
See, modern science, through its
own clumsy methods of progress,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
has been exploring deeper
levels of nature, deeper levels

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:90%
of nature's intelligence.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, has
discovered at the foundation

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, a single
universal field of nature's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
intelligence that
underlies and pervades

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
everyone and everything in
the universe, an organizing

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
intelligence that governs the
expansion of the vast universe

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
with its trillions
of galaxies, each

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
with 100 billion suns, many
with planetary systems,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
teeming with life as is our own,
a single, all-nourishing field

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of nature's intelligence that
conducts the evolution of seven

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and a half million species
on Earth, in Earth's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
complex ecosystems,
in this intricate web

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
of mutual interdependence
and mutual nourishment.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
That vast organizing
intelligence of nature,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
natural law, the will of
God, and its unified source

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and an all-pervading
unified field

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence that
underlies and pervades us all.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The science, the discovery
of spirit of unity, of peace,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic intelligence, and
perhaps more importantly,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
this intelligence
of the universe

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
is just not foreign to us.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It is at the very foundation
of human existence,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
the very foundation
of human experience.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It is our own consciousness.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
If we scratch deeply
enough beneath the surface,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
beneath our molecular and
atomic and nuclear and sub

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
nuclear levels, and we
arrive at the foundation

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
of human existence, we all
arrive at the self same unity,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
at the pure, abstract
field of intelligence,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
universal intelligence,
or consciousness

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
that is the foundation
of human experience.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And human consciousness,
human awareness, human mind

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:84%
can experience this wholeness,
this cosmic intelligence

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the majesty,
the specialty

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
of this exquisitely designed
human nervous system,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to experience
unbounded consciousness

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
through the systematic expansion
of human comprehension.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the
scientific affirmation

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient tradition
of spiritual experience.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual experience,
capital S, is the experience

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
of unbounded cosmic
intelligence,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
which is our own intelligence,
which is our own cell.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Our whole human physiology
is made of that intelligence,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:90%
every fiber of us.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Every fiber of the human
brain, human physiology,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is steeped in that
cosmic intelligence.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
We are walking, living
libraries of total natural law.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We carry the infinite
organizing power of nature that

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:90%
governs the universe within us.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.455 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, admittedly, sometimes
our consciousness

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
gets rather caught up
in narrow boundaries

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:90%
of limitations and stress.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
spiritual experience

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
has been, in general, reserved
for the relatively few,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
for the fortunate
ones, who naturally

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
rise to that exalted
experience, or who

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
have come across a
program, a practice, that

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
leads the mind beyond
thought to the experience

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:90%
of the boundless.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But now, the significance
of science saying yes, we

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
are all one, science even,
affirming the fundamental unity

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of life and of humanity
means that now, perhaps

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
for the first time,
we can transcend

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that artificial separation
of church and state,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and we can provide
to our growing

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
youth in the name of science,
the experience of spirit,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:90%
the experience of wholeness.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.385 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
When unity, the experience,
living experience of unity,

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
which is our
birthright, and simply

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
results from that
natural expansion

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of human comprehension, then
we perceive life's truth,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
the scientific truth of
life, that we are all one.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
According to modern science,
everything in the universe, you

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and me and everyone
and everything,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
we're just vibrations
of this universal field

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The so-called
elementary particles

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that populate the universe,
what are they, in fact?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Little waves of vibration
of an unbounded ocean

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is not
a material universe.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a cosmic symphony, all
vibrating, scintillating

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And when we perceive directly
that reality, when we perceive

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:10%
other as the self, when
everything is as near

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:10%
and as dear as one's self, when
the unifying force of love,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:10%
the unified field unites
opposites and transcends

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:10%
surface differences to perceive
our central unity, that state

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:10%
of exalted spiritual
consciousness,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:10%
our birthright makes
it impossible to behave

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:10%
towards others, as you would
not have them behave unto you,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:10%
because you perceive directly
the truth of everyone

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:10%
and everything as one's self.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Now what have come to
share with you today

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps a step
beyond and a step more

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
exciting than the
capability of anyone

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%
anywhere to step on to
their spiritual nature.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is the power,
the world transforming

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
power of the collective
experience of unity.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Group spiritual experience.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There's an old saying from
somewhere, very dear, that

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
says, when two or more gather in
my name, it's called a church.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:90%
What's the significance of that?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
The significance is
the power of numbers.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And now that we know--

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you already
knew-- but now

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that we also know, that
consciousness is a field,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:84%
a universal field,
then we would expect

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that the field of consciousness
supports waves of vibration,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that travel out and touch
everyone everywhere all

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:90%
over the globe.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the value of sharing,
spiritual communion together,

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
pure consciousness, experience
the unified field together,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the phenomenon of
constructive interference

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
amplifies our
individual experience.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Now you do the math.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:84%
About 8,000 of us collectively
experiencing and stimulating

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
the field of peace, the
field of unity within,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
will create an indomitable
influence of coherence

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that can wipe away generations
of accumulated enmity, racial,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.738 align:middle line:90%
religious, and ethnic tension.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very important
scientific discovery,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
knowing which you just want to
take action and gather together

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
groups of sufficient size,
sharing and collectively

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
experiencing wholeness and
the indomitable waves of peace

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that this will create,
bearing in mind

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our favor,
that the field of peace,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
this unified field
that transcends

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
differences and unites
opposites is 10 million,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
million, million
times more powerful

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:90%
than the nuclear force.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It just needs to be unleashed.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:00.535 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:10%
What is the Trinity in
this scientific language?

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:10%
The Trinity is the unity of
knower, knowing, and known,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:10%
in one indivisible structure
of pure consciousness.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:10%
But consciousness
being conscious, wide

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:10%
awake within its own nature,
sees itself, and as such,

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:10%
perceives itself as the
knower and the known

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and the process of knowing.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:10%
This internal dynamism,
three-in-one structure

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:10%
of unity, this holy
Trinity, in turn,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:10%
gives rise to the
sequential emergence

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:10%
of all thought and all matter.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
In physics, we call this
sequential spontaneous

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.801 align:middle line:90%
dynamical symmetry breaking.

00:12:51.801 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:10%
But it is a field of
peace, a field of unity,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:10%
and it is our field,
because there is--

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:10%
now, we can
scientifically say perhaps

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:10%
what you've always felt. We
have a scientific explanation

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:10%
of why consciousness is always
experienced in the first person

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:10%
singular, why there
really ultimately is only

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:10%
an I of consciousness,
and that's

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:10%
because there is only one
consciousness in this room.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And it is you, and it is
me, and it is all of us.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we have
is an opportunity

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that is now manifesting
in the world

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to create together such a
powerful influence of peace

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that we can put an end
to the age old legacy

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:90%
of human brutality and war.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
In India, universities
of world peace

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
are being founded and
in the US and in Israel.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the number 8,000 students
at each of these campuses

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is significant because
that's the square root of 1%

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of the population of the world.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the number
that has been shown now

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
in 50 consecutive published
scientific studies

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
to transform the
direction of time.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
What happens when that
wholeness is enlivened,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
when thrills of unity
become enlivened

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
through the collective practice,
the collective experience

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit of unity?

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Then the spirit becomes more
accessible, more immediately

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.105 align:middle line:90%
present to everyone.

00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wakes up in the
morning with a little bit

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:90%
more EEG coherence.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wakes up with a
little bit more wholeness

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
or totality of natural
law, lively, that means.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts and actions
are more aligned

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
with natural law, life
supporting, life nourishing.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And the trends of
society subtly shift,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
but measurably,
demonstrably, and profoundly

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
from one of difference
dominated to one

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:90%
of a unified family of nations.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Look at the world today.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It is criss-crossed by
artificial national boundaries,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:84%
completely arbitrary
separations that pit

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
humanity against humanity, that
separate humanity from itself,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:84%
all of this basically a
product of a world of divided

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, obsolete knowledge,
barbaric and archaic knowledge,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
now being replaced by the
dawning knowledge of unity.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.478 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
What is the result when
this spiritual experience,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
the experience of unbounded
wholeness of spirit

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is enlivened in our very
brain physiology, when

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
total natural law, the
fountainhead of all

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature that uphold
and nourish the universe,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
when that is fully lively
in individual comprehension,

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
then every impulse
of thought and action

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
is aligned with
total natural law.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
That means
spontaneously righteous,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
life nourishing behavior results
when total natural law is

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
lively in human awareness.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
When individuals begin to
experience this, then we have,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
really, I guess you could say
ideal citizenship, the ability

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of self-government,
the ability to govern

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
one's own life spontaneously
free from problems, actions

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that benefit ourselves, but
also benefit the broader

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
society in the physical
environment in which we live.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Such comprehensive action
is coming and coming

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
quickly due to groups such
as this in these huge groups

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:84%
24 hours a day, practice of
transcendental meditation,

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:84%
stimulation of the
field of unity,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
plus other very unique
advanced Vedic technologies

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, mantras
that are extracted

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
from the vast Vedic literature
specifically engineered

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
to create a resonance in
the unified field that

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:84%
will enliven, stimulate
the experience of peace

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and the experience
of unity everywhere.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So added to our own
continuous activities,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
these permanent lighthouses
of coherence for the world,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe are going to
see a very powerful, very

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
rapid transformation in the
destiny of human civilization.

Now as someone with former
political aspirations,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:10%
I will say that don't
look to politicians.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:10%
To improve the destiny
of civilization.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:10%
A government, frankly, can't
give us what we don't deserve.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We sow the seeds of our
own health every day

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
through our life nourishing
behavior or life damaging.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We create our own wealth
through our own support

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of nature, our own energy,
our own industriousness,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:90%
our own ingenuity.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Government is not a treasure
chest of health or wealth.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We ultimately are the
governors of our own destiny.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So unless we, through our
own life supporting behavior,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and by elevating the behavior
of the world as a whole,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
ratchet up the collective
consciousness of human

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.594 align:middle line:84%
civilization, we cannot deserve
better, but we're about to.

I have a very
delightful personal,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:10%
taken on the responsibility
now of documenting

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:10%
the transformation in the trends
of time over the next months

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:10%
and over the next couple
years, as these groups,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:10%
these universities
of world peace,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:10%
dedicated solely to
the prevention of war

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:10%
and the promotion of peace, are
established and begin to have

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:10%
their influence in the world.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:10%
By the way, even the notion
of a university of peace

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:10%
is a refreshing
notion, something

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:10%
to counterbalance the
runaway proliferation

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:10%
of military academies and
graduate war colleges,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to advancing
the science of war.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Why not have one university
in the world dedicated

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to promoting and advancing
the science and art of peace

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and create in the process a new
profession in the world, that

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:90%
of professional peacemaker?

Equipped with all the knowledge
and all the technologies

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to diffuse environmental
negativity,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to diffuse social stress.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Any researcher in
the field of conflict

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that the first
step in the outbreak of war

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
is the build up of
enmity and stress

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and tensions among
rival factions.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Nip it in the bud.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Diffuse that escalating
tensions at its source

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
by creating indomitable
waves of unity and coherence

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
in the collective
consciousness of society.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
My job now is to
document the transition,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and I would like to urge
you all today to be alert,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to witness the
transformation that

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
will take place, the
drop in violent crime,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.337 align:middle line:90%
domestic abuse, drug dependency.

00:20:45.337 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen fast.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.626 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.626 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Through the power
of this spirit,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
we are going to see a total
transformation in civilization.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't witness
it, we'll miss it.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll find
is we will all soon

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
forget what human
life has been like for

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:90%
the last several hundred years.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting
over a disease.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:90%
You pray for relief.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You say, I'm going to be
good for the rest of my life

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
if I just get over this, if
you just help me get over this.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.845 align:middle line:90%
How quickly we forget.

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to forget
lesser states of evolution

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and to focus on the
increasing positivity,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
but we must document the
transformation of civilization,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't record
that for future generations,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.285 align:middle line:84%
they may forget what happens
when you neglect the spirit.

00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So let me just applaud you
and thank you most deeply

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
for your contribution to the
rising collective consciousness

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, to the
growing unit, the growing

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
liveliness of spirit.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You may not have known,
probably did, the impact

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
you have beyond the walls
of this beautiful church.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's huge.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The ripple effect goes
beyond our families,

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
beyond our work environment,
touches the world,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:90%
even the universe.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The heavens will
open when we enliven

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
total natural law
and human awareness

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness
of civilization,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
when people behave on Earth
in harmony with natural law

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
as they do in heaven, then
heavens will pour down upon us.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.795 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:51.795 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Witness this transformation.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Participate in it.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Be the core of it through
your own, capital S,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual experience.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Witness it, celebrate
it, and enjoy

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.090 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful and celebratory day.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
