>> What I say is how my
showing up in the world,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
because the other for
me is just practice.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And if I save myself, and
I'm not really connected

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:84%
with others and being
a beneficial presence

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, then all
the practice in my view

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.893 align:middle line:90%
is for naught.

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Those of you that are here,
I want to congratulate you,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
because you're here to talk
about the game of your life.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations for being here.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Winning the game of
life, this game plan

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
was developed, as
a lot of things

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
are, out of a very, very
difficult time, and 1989

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:90%
for me was watershed year.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
You know how a lot of
us look like we have it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
all together in our lives?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything looks
great on the outside,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
but maybe there's rumblings
inside that say otherwise.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
certainly true for me

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
in 1989, because at that
time, just prior to 1989,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
you would have
seen a person that

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
looked like he was in
a healthy relationship.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Wife and two kids, would go
into church every Sunday,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and well-coiffed and smiling
and bright-eyed and bushy tail.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
By all appearances,
good health, and we

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
had maybe 25 or 30 tire
stores in those days

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and looked like very much a
career success type thing.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So career, health, and
personal relationships,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
three of our potential
areas of wake up for us.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
All those looked like for me
to be pretty well in place,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:90%
everything going really well.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I kind of sensed there were
some things going on underneath,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:90%
but I was pretty good at denial.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty good
at fooling myself,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and I figured I could
out-think just about anything.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But within a four month period,
in 1989, those three things

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:90%
came tumbling down.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I was
shaving one morning,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
and I saw a lump right here.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And it proved to be cancer,
and it was an operation.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Took it out and
there was radiation

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in that area,
and ended up being very, very

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
difficult. I lost my taste buds
for maybe three or four months.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Radiation burns in my
mouth, so my weight

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:90%
went down to about 160-155.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 220 right now, so if
you can imagine 155 on me.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:90%
So that was very difficult.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that happened
within that four month period

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
was the end of my
25-year marriage.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the thing that
really hits me about that,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the night that my son--

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:90%
my younger son, Chris--

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
the night after we had told him.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
We were riding in the
car, and he looks at me.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And tears are in his eyes,
and he says, dad, we're

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.062 align:middle line:90%
not a family anymore.

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't rip your
heart out, nothing does.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And the third
thing that happened

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
was maybe a month later,
the chief financial officer

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Says Tom, our credit
line's exhausted,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.012 align:middle line:84%
and we're million dollars
short in the bank account.

00:03:56.012 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to make payment?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So this was 1989 in
a four-month period.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.545 align:middle line:84%
All three of our potential
areas for wake calls--

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:84%
not that there aren't
others, but those

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:90%
are three the biggies--

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:90%
came at once.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So I had to look and say,
OK, how have I been--

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a reassessment
time obviously.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I discovered
in that reassessment

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:90%
was that I'd done a really--

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time
controlling other people,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:90%
managing other people.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Man, I was the ultimate
manage control--

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
kids, spouse, employees.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Man, oh, man.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I was-- and if I heard
something in a seminar

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
or I read it in a book, never
did I say, wow, I could use it.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, oh, yeah,
she ought to do that.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Or yeah, yeah, the kids,
they need to read this.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll probably
underline it for them--

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:90%
or the employees.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we'll get
them going on that.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But this caused a
tremendous reassessment

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that said, no, you can't
look outside anymore.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't send
enough endorphins

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:90%
to the rescue with my workouts.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't out think it.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So I sat-- and I
didn't have the kind

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of psychological and spiritual
depth to be able to handle it.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So those things sent
me crashing down.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:90%
So how did I get out?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
I limped in to a therapist.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
After I interviewed
five, I found

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
a person who ended up being
my most valuable mentor

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and therapist.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And that woman happens
to be in the room.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Brenda, would you come
up please just a second.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is Brenda
Schafer, and, Brenda,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you a million.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.422 align:middle line:90%
Big round of applause for this--

00:05:48.422 --> 00:05:51.254 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
With Brenda in reading
Yogananda, Krishnamurti,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.596 align:middle line:84%
Ouspensky, Gurdjieff, Tao
Te Ching, many, many--

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
"A Course in Miracles"--
many, many things.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Psychologically, many
books on psychology.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:10%
Brenda, incredible
help in psychology.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:10%
So psychological,
spiritual things.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.197 align:middle line:10%
Took Tai Chi classes.

00:06:28.197 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:10%
I went full-court press on this.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:10%
I figured, at 42 years
old, how easy is it

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:10%
to change a 42-year-old male?

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
We're talking tough stuff.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, I
couldn't just have

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:90%
this kind of part measures.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Just kind of let--

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll just
dabble and go in and see

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
a therapist for a
couple three months,

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
find out where everybody
else is screwed up.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't going to fly.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Or get a-- or for
me, born again,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and just in denial
about everything else

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and just determine
to be born again.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It took full-court press,
all cylinders going.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
So out of that came--

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.338 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea
in those days there

00:07:12.338 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
was going to be any
book out of that.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
That only surfaced in
the last three years,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:90%
after tremendous amount of--

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
making tons of mistakes.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:10%
And I considered my company
and my personal life kind of

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.825 align:middle line:10%
like my laboratory.

00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:10%
And I'd mix this up,
and try this, and whoop,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:10%
that didn't work.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll try this,
and this works.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And after a lot of
trial and error,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:84%
came up with a game plan
that really works for me.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's served up, however, to
everybody else buffet-style.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So in this book, for
instance, the word "should,"

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able to find
anywhere in that book,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
unless Random House
slipped it in somewhere,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.362 align:middle line:84%
because every time I
saw that was in there,

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:90%
we got it out of there.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The word "oughta"
is not in there.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The word "need to"
is not in there.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all CEO and head
coach of our own existence.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Today, health is excellent.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.985 align:middle line:90%
I got a physical.

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get more
money, and the insurance

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
says-- our company has grown.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We want to have the insurance
up by many millions of dollars.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And the insurance agent
said, yeah, right.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Cancer radiation.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Tom.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well,
let's give it a shot.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So gave an intense
all-day physical,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:90%
because we wanted lots of money.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:90%
So they-- very, very careful.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:90%
And he called me back one night.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had known this
agent for like 30 years.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:90%
He was a neighbor.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.755 align:middle line:90%
And he was choking.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
He was really emotional,
in a nice way.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Very, very-- feeling
what was going on.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I can't
believe this, Tom.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.775 align:middle line:10%
He said, not only
can we insure you,

00:08:56.775 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:10%
and even though you were dinged
for the cancer and radiation,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.677 align:middle line:10%
all the pluses on
the rest of it--

00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:10%
not only can we
insure you, but you're

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.200 align:middle line:10%
in the lowest of six risk
categories, so that was real--

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:10%
He said, I used to
laugh at your meditation

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:10%
and your microbiotic
diet, he said,

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:10%
and all these other
things that you do.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Tai Chi and all
these other things.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm not
laughing anymore.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:90%
He says, this is incredible.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that
the business became much,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
much more successful, and
we grew from 20 to 25 stores

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:90%
then to the size we are today.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Material abundance flowed.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:90%
But the most important thing--

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the third thing-- was the
connectedness with everybody

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
that resulted in this.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:10%
I was living life on
more of a shallow--

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:10%
kind of on a
surface-type situation.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And what's happened as a
result of this full-court press

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:10%
has been deep,
deep relationships

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:10%
with significant other,
with children, with parents,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:10%
with co-workers, the universe.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a depth that I never--

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you can't
know what you don't know.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
that was available.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to have
the depth of relationships

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in all of those areas has
been the number one payoff.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.635 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:90%
In determining our mission--

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:90%
for me, that's bedrock.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.567 align:middle line:84%
To have our mission, to be in
touch with our mission, what

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:90%
our mission is about, our why.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Nietzsche said, "Once
you know your why,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%
you can bear most any how."

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that was really key.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:10%
When I got in touch with
my mission, I said, OK.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was done
through a guided imagery

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
in Brenda's office that
was very, very powerful.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And once I got in
touch with my mission,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
then, despite all the
challenges and roadblocks I saw,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that provided the
spark, the fuel.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a saying that
the pull of the future

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is more powerful than
the push of the past.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So there was something about
that, OK, here's my mission.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, OK,
here's my assignment.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.157 align:middle line:84%
I got in touch
with my assignment.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
So OK, what's the next step?

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.433 align:middle line:90%
I'm just moving toward it.

00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just walking,
and going toward it,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:90%
making things happen.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to get
myself stabilized--

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:90%
because I was in rough shape.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get out
of bed each day.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, I limped into
the office, laid on the couch,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and put do not disturb on
the door and the phone.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So I did-- in order
to stabilize--

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
go for about six months
with Prozac and Buspar,

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
an antidepressant
and an anti-anxiety.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I was in such difficult shape.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I may have done it with
a one-ring wake-up call.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I may have done it with a two.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:90%
I know I did it with three.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:90%
But whatever it took to--

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I was not able to even
stabilize myself to think.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So that got me the ability to
even halfway think straight,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
with all three of those
things happening at once.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Then, as the game plan
got kicking in, then

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
after six months,
I was fortunately

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:90%
able to not do that.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.565 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage anyone
who is in such trauma--

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I
think the key on some

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
of these-- doing a
game plan like this

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
if you're not in
trauma or crisis,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but if you're seeing some little
cracks in the foundation in any

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of those areas, then I just wish
I'd have engaged in the game

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
plan, because many of us
don't do that until we've

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:90%
come crashing down.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like a "pay me
now or pay me later."

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
You might as well go through
and be proactive about it,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and not wait until that occurs.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's-- by the way--

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
why, even though
I'm blessed today,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying on this game plan.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.658 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm
staying on my knees.

00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to keep doing it.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Rather than forget, I
don't want to forget.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to remember it
so that I keep doing it,

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:90%
rather than have a relapse.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So discover my
mission was bedrock.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, if my
only why, my only mission

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
was to give pain
to my birth mother

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and consume natural
resources, that probably

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a high level
of really what

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to accomplish here.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So I got in touch with something
a little deeper than that.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's two ways
to be able to do this.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
One is a birth
exploration, in terms of--

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:90%
we did the guided imagery.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it with a
psychologist, or a friend,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
or with yourself.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Whatever method someone
wants to do that.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Going back before my birth, and
envisioning myself being born.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And asking a higher power--

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
having a higher power ask
me what my mission is,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and my being able to
get in touch with that.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:90%
So that was an important piece.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The second way to do that
is a death exploration.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Is to think about,
OK, if somebody says,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
no, I really don't want to
do that, OK, then a death

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:90%
exploration is another one.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.815 align:middle line:84%
What do you want somebody to say
about you, as far as a eulogy?

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
somebody to say?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And a personal mission
statement can be one sentence,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
or it can be two pages.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Some people have differing
opinions on the length.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I say, go with what
feels good to you.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Mine is seven sentences.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
My mission statement
is to become

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
more awakened and
conscious and connected

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:90%
in all my relationships.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's to support that evolution
through this winning game plan.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It's to share love with
family and friends.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.585 align:middle line:84%
It's to share these
concepts in my--

00:15:16.585 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and create a
business environment

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
where I can share
these concepts.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Not with a "should" or an
"oughta," but with something

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that is served up buffet-style
with our teammates.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It's to respect the
Earth that we live on.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's to share the skills that
I've learned in the business

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
world with those I
know that are doing

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
great work in the world in terms
of personal growth and higher

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:10%
People like Deepak and John
Robbins, and various others,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:10%
to take--

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:10%
because this is a
two-worlds deal.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:10%
The business world
sometimes looks

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:10%
at the self-help, personal
growth, higher consciousness

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:10%
movement with saying,
well, wait a minute.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Little weird.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I see that the personal
growth community sometimes

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:90%
looks at business--

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
especially medium-sized and big
business-- as a little weird.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll walk into Present Moment
if I happen to have a suit on.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They go, what's this guy
doing invading our space?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, I've
seen discrimination

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:90%
going in both worlds, FYI.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So I love both worlds, and I
think what this book is about,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and this game plan is
about, is about merging

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:90%
the best of both worlds.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And the last one is
that of helping people

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
accomplish their mission.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And through the
book, the ability

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share things
that may help, in some way,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
each person accomplish
their mission

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and have a more fulfilled life.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So those are the seven
pieces of my mission.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The second element of the
plan is that of these seven

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
take-action steps.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are these
very linear steps

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:90%
that start with goal-setting.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
Whereas your mission was my
overall for-life situation--

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
can be tweaked--

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the seven take-action steps
start with goal-setting.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:90%
This annual goal-setting.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Every November,
December, I sit down

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and I say, what do
I want to accomplish

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
moving toward my mission
in each of those areas?

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
In each of those areas are my
headings in my goal-setting.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I like outlining for
my annual goal-setting.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And let's say all of those
where were the headings.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I would use subheadings
under each of those.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And under the parents and
elders, let's say one of mine,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
some time ago, was deepen my
relationship with my mother.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you could put deepen
your relationship-- let's

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:84%
say parents and elders
would be the heading.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And then a subheading would
be, deepen your relationship

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
with blank, and put
whatever you wanted to put.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use an
example with mother.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is going to sound a
little linear for some people,

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
but just hang with
me just a minute.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Then I would put
things like, OK, I

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
want to take an annual
vacation with mom.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'd write that down.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I want to
call her every Sunday.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I want to do
this, and I want to do that.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'd lay out.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Send cards on these dates.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to do these kinds
of things with mom.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the
qualitative-type things.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to share more
deeply with mom.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out what's
going on in her world.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Find out how she feels
about things, what

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
she did when she was young.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to share things that
are going on in my life

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
more deeply.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So there are those
qualitative-type things.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
do in each area--

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and then I would take
each one of those areas.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And with children, OK, I want
an annual vacation, just them

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and I, where we do
this, this, and this.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And lay these things out.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, if at the end of
each year right now,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.873 align:middle line:84%
you're giving and getting
in the world in each

00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
of these relationships,
then I wouldn't screw around

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
with this, because it has that
linear component that maybe is

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:90%
necessary to be able to do it.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.205 align:middle line:84%
For me, though, I'd
say, god, the year pa--

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get this done,
didn't get that done.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:10%
So this gives it the
ability, when I lay out--

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:10%
and it takes me a couple hours
to lay out two or three sheets.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I convert
those goals and action

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.015 align:middle line:84%
plans right to my schedule
as I'm doing my scheduling.

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You know when we say
what our priorities are?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.538 align:middle line:84%
What we say what they
are and our schedule,

00:19:46.538 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
check your schedule
out and that will

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:90%
say what they actually are.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the connecting the
dots of, here's my mission,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
then here are my goals to help
me get toward my mission, goals

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and action plans,
then here are my--

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
then I'm moving
that to my schedule

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and it actually happens.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Now you say, too
structured for me.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Too not spontaneous enough.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to be
spontaneous because I know

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that those things are all set.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm doing activities,
anything I'm doing,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm really in the
present moment.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking about,
gosh, what do I have to do?

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this
stuff is set out.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I also know that if
something else comes up,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
now I want to be careful and
not engage in procrastination,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.863 align:middle line:84%
but I also know that if I
need to call an audible,

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I still have the
flexibility to do that.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.825 align:middle line:84%
Then time competency is another
one of the seven action steps.

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have all the time

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.506 align:middle line:84%
you need to get done whatever
you need to get done?

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, I don't see any hands.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
A couple tips on that.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
One would be,
careful the message

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.475 align:middle line:84%
we're sending
ourselves each day.

00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I was sending
myself the message,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough time,
I don't have enough time,

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough time.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
We all know the
power of our minds,

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.328 align:middle line:90%
and the placebo effect, and--

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
this group certainly knows
the power of the mind.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So careful of the messages
that we're sending ourselves.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, to understand actually
how many hours we truly do

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:90%
have in a week.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And we have 168.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
If you sleep seven hours
a night, you got 120 left.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:84%
If you work 50 hours a week, you
got 70 waking non-worked hours.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you work or
sleep slightly different,

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:90%
adjust that.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's 60.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's 70.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's 80.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:10%
But the average person has 70
waking non-work hours per week

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:10%
available.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't feel that way, does it?

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I talk about in the
book what I call the seven

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
sabotaging time-stealers.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The things that I believe
filch time from us.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that of doing
non-mission-related activities.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if I haven't
determined my mission,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and determined what are the
goals, the action plans,

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and what I want to do in
1999, then what happens?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.985 align:middle line:84%
I end up getting bounced
around like a ping pong ball.

00:22:06.985 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing other
things, and I'm not

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
spending time on the
things that I need to do--

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
the things that I want to
get and give in the world.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when I'm talking
about goal-setting,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about what
I want to get and give.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not a me, me,
me, want, want, want.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way situation.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:90%
A third sabotager is that of TV.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.722 align:middle line:90%
And now, TV/internet.

00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, Wisdom TV would go
a long ways, and PBS.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
There's some good programming,
so don't get me wrong.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.065 align:middle line:84%
So TV was one thing that
didn't make the cut.

00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:90%
That was gone.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, I probably
watch a half an hour a day,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.078 align:middle line:84%
and catch a little CNN to see
what's happening on the news.

00:22:55.078 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
But TV went.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The average person
watches 25 hours a week.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's 33%,
roughly one third

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:90%
of their waking non-work hours.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So-- by the way.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And if that's according to
what we want out of our lives,

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%
then great.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.242 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if we
determine that's part

00:23:12.242 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of our mission, that's part of
our goal-setting for the year,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
then high-five
yourself, because this

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
isn't about shoulds
or oughtas, but it's

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
about doing things consciously.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Waking up.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.547 align:middle line:84%
That's what this whole
movement's about,

00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
is doing things in
a more awakened,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.502 align:middle line:90%
more conscious manner.

00:23:27.502 --> 00:23:29.967 align:middle line:90%

00:23:34.305 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the behaviors,
these are the traits

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.263 align:middle line:90%
that I think are critical.

00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:40.157 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.157 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And we also look for
teammates that are like that.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I look for this in myself, and I
look for teammates on our team.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that we
recruit for at Tires Plus.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:90%
The six things that we look for.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The first is that of--
and our six traits

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:90%
are the acronym COPPSS.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It signifies it.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, our COPPSS has
two Ps and two Ss.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:90%
The first is that of caring.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Being caring.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.825 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do most
people say when they

00:24:08.825 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:90%
are interviewing for a job?

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They like to work with what?

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> People.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You got it.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:90%
People.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
What do a lot of people
say after three, four,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.305 align:middle line:84%
or five months in a high
people-contact business?

00:24:21.305 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hate people.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLING] I hate people.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
These people.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand them.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, these people.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this laboratory of my
company, I've looked at that,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and I've really looked
at that and examined it.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen-- and this
is a gross generalization,

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
but you have one
group that are people

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, they like
to work with people,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
but don't let me have to go out
of my way too much for them.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen that in a waiter,
a waitress, or some clerk?

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:90%
They're not mean.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's a little
bit of an imposition.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And then there's people
that-- and by the way,

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
for those people, helping
people sucks energy from them.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They're depleted
by helping people.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got people
that are altruistic,

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
service-oriented, curious
about people, love people.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Not only like to work with them,
but really truly like to help

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And those people generally
draw energy from others,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and from that helping.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.952 align:middle line:90%
They really-- it's exciting.

00:25:23.952 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting for them.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Wow, this is fun.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Wow, I get to help.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that
those people don't

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.660 align:middle line:84%
have an occasional
rough experience,

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:90%
or an occasional rough day.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, they draw
energy from helping people.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:90%
So check your caring index.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
My dad, by the way,
is one of those

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that has a high
caring index that

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:90%
are real curious about people.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
One day, my two
sons and I and he

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
were retracing his steps that he
had taken during World War II.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:90%
We were in Paris.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:90%
We were in the Louvre Museum.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was about five minutes
before the thing was to close,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and we hadn't seen
the Mona Lisa.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And we were lost.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So Dad says, I'll
go ask these people.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.892 align:middle line:84%
So he goes over
and he asks them.

00:26:05.892 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like about a
minute or two has gone.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.933 align:middle line:90%
He's over there talking to them.

00:26:08.933 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:90%
I say, Dad, where are you going?

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, these are
the greatest people!

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:90%
We can see that another time.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:90%
He didn't care.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:90%
He loves people.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:90%
So check your caring index.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Where are you on
the caring index?

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Are you high?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Are you low?

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell
you, if you think

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:84%
that the relationships you're in
and how we're acting in those--

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:90%
those affect it.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Our spiritual connection,
our psychological wellness,

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:90%
our physical wellness.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
How we're eating, how we're
exercising, how we're sleeping.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:90%
These things all have--

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not doing well in
those areas, I'm cranky.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.818 align:middle line:84%
But if I am, I'm taking care
of myself in those areas.

00:26:47.818 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's sometimes what
we got to look at, is--

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.388 align:middle line:84%
we can also err
on the other side,

00:26:51.388 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is give, give, give
to everyone else,

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and we don't take
care of ourselves

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
so we can then nurture
and give to others.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:90%
So caring's a big piece.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Optimism is another
important piece.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
authentic optimism.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
the phony optimism.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.658 align:middle line:84%
If you saw "Fargo," the
car salesperson there.

00:27:08.658 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll say, how's it going?

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:90%
You betcha.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Or the Eddie Haskell type.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, Mrs. Cleaver, don't
you look great today."

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
that kind of stuff.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm also not talking
about negativism,

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.863 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, oh,
you can't do this.

00:27:26.863 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you can do
this here in this company.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:90%
No way you can do that.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And sending messages to ourself
on, we're not very good,

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:90%
or I'm not very good.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thing
is sabotaging to us,

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and that pessimism
drags us down.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:10%
And because of the
power of the mind

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.888 align:middle line:10%
really makes it not possible
for things to happen.

00:27:47.888 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, that
kind of thing is like--

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe we all have this
wise coach that's coaching us.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then this
rambunctious child that's

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
wanting to go over and do this.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So it'd be like, if we're
sending negative thoughts

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves and
being a pessimist,

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
then it's like, let's say we're
huddling our team together

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're saying,
OK, inner team.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:90%
You're not very good.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You're probably not going to
win this game of your life.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But go out there
and play it anyway.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not going to work.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It's also not going to work
that everything's perfect here.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:90%
We do our affirmations.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything's good.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.198 align:middle line:84%
But what is is,
hey, you know what?

00:28:28.198 --> 00:28:29.865 align:middle line:84%
There's some challenges
here, but here's

00:28:29.865 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
how we're going to overcome it.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's authentic optimism.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:84%
The third trait is
that of passion.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Getting passion into our lives.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:90%
True passion.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was more
into the intellect,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and really didn't get in
touch with the full passion.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have my heart, my gut,
my soul into what I was saying.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.983 align:middle line:90%
I was very into the intellect.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.650 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
ever given an apo--

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and passion enters into
various ways of our lives,

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
but our apologies, selling,
coaching or leading others

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:90%
are just three of many ways.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.996 align:middle line:90%
Let's take an apology.

00:29:08.996 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
(DRYLY) I'm sorry if I did
something that made you mad.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.407 align:middle line:84%
That's very discounting to
you, and I'm-- we got the right

00:29:15.407 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:90%
lingo, right?

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
It's very discounting to you.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.213 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you don't
feel good about that,

00:29:20.213 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and I can totally
understand that.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Or are you doing this?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, don't
say it like this

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.097 align:middle line:90%
if you don't really feel it.

00:29:31.097 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're not talking about
phony-ing something up.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you really do feel
apologetic, then get in touch

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and say, (CONCERNED) gosh,
I am so sorry I did that.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
That is not OK.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Very discounting to you.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Different deal?

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And again, don't phony it up.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'm saying.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.410 align:middle line:84%
If you do truly feel
sorry, bring your heart,

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.195 align:middle line:90%
your gut, your soul into it.

00:29:56.195 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And you won't have
many apologies

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that aren't accepted if
you apologize like that.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:90%
So ask yourself.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And why this is so
important is because

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
of the importance of
tone and body language,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
which is 93% of
our interpersonal--

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:84%
of what people get,
or the message people

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is receiving for us
that are receiving

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:90%
from us in our communications.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:90%
93%.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:90%
7% is actually the words.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So real, real important
piece to have passion in it.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The fourth trait is
that of persistence.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Persistence is about, when
we keep going for it--

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Murphy's laws work
a lot of times.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:84%
If anything can
go wrong, it will.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, never vision Murphy's law.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
power of the mind.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But know that it has the
potential underpinnings

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:90%
of things going on.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So to access that
persistence is important.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, the best
example of persistence

00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:90%
was back in 1976, '77.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:10%
We had just started the company.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.772 align:middle line:84%
And you remember the shortage
in the gasoline lines?

00:31:07.772 --> 00:31:09.797 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or the li-- no
shortage in the lines.

00:31:09.797 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The lines were long.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:90%
The gas was short.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.598 align:middle line:84%
And we had three gas
stations back then

00:31:15.598 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that we turned them
into tire stores.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:90%
That's how we got started.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.497 align:middle line:10%
We bought three
Shell gas stations

00:31:19.497 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and turned them
into tire stores.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.453 align:middle line:84%
So gasoline was an important
part of what we were doing.

00:31:25.453 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And we got our allocation
from the government,

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and the allocation
was way too low.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So we said, OK, what
are we going to do?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to appeal it,
in the interest of persistence.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:90%
And we appealed it.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Appeal denied.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And we said, OK, we're
going to call down.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to appeal the appeal.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
process, so stay at home.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I'm
going to go to Chicago.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
headquarters were.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the name of the head
of the Department of Energy,

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Ray Feeney.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Says, I'm going to go see him.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Fly to Chicago.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Go up there.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.545 align:middle line:90%
Ask the receptionist.

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Say, can I see Mr. Feeney?

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And she says, no, you
can't see Mr. Feeney.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%
He is so busy.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, ma'am, I've
got to see Mr. Feeney.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll just sit down over here.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I knew he had to
come out sometime.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I sit, I sit, I sit.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
2, 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Finally, he came out.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Ted, would you mind helping
me out on this, please?

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no poetic
license being taken here.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.830 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly what happened.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Feeney did
walk into the restroom.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind?

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.765 align:middle line:90%
And I did follow him.

00:32:34.765 --> 00:32:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I swear, this is
exactly what happened.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mr. Feeney, I am
so sorry to bother you.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And he was using the facilities.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, my name's Tom Gegak.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Tires Plus in Minneapolis.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him 30 seconds on
why we should get our appeal.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, kid.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Get into my office.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.163 align:middle line:90%
And we got the increased appeal.

00:32:54.163 --> 00:32:56.498 align:middle line:84%
Let's give Ted a
round of applause.

00:32:56.498 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:90%
So persistence.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Critical.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Think about the things.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:84%
What are the roadblocks
for you right now?

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.478 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain roadblocks
that are standing in your way?

00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you've done
the double-check on,

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:90%
is this part of my mission?

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.266 align:middle line:84%
Is this honoring
to me and others?

00:33:16.266 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
If it meets various criteria,
go for it, go for it, go for it.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.162 align:middle line:84%
Then the fifth trade is
that of systems discipline.

00:33:27.162 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Are we following the rules and
procedures in our companies?

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I know us free spirits
don't like to do that.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't,
there's chaos, so try

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to do your best to
abide by the rules.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Especially the higher-ups,
they like that.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
They think they're higher-ups.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.646 align:middle line:90%
They're not higher-ups.

00:33:42.646 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But they like those biding
by the rules things.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So score some points.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Sixth is that of
being spirit-filled.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Spirit-filled.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the sixth trait.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is
personified by what

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Obi Wan Kenobi said to Luke.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "May the
force be with you."

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And when that force
is with me, when

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm in touch with my mission,
and I'm acting consistently,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.528 align:middle line:84%
congruently with that, and
moving toward my mission

00:34:16.528 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and acting rightly in the
world, and when that happens,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, waters
part, doors open,

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.867 align:middle line:84%
coincidences occur
that are unbelievable.

00:34:24.867 --> 00:34:27.159 align:middle line:84%
The kind of things that ended
up resulting in this book

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:90%
are incredible.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
At Deepak Chopra's
daughter's wedding

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:90%
in India in December of '96.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had just only vaguely
thought of writing a book.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were out with Deepak's
publicist, Arielle Ford,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:90%
for a walk.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She says, you want
to go for a walk?

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And the park we're
walking in was a park

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.552 align:middle line:84%
that Deepak's editors from
Random House was walking in.

00:34:53.552 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
let's have lunch.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:90%
We go to lunch.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.310 align:middle line:90%
He starts asking about--

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I start telling a little
bit about my story.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.935 align:middle line:84%
Based on what she
said, she says,

00:35:00.935 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
have you ever thought
of writing a book?

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, I bet a ton
of people ask you.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know you were
going around asking people.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of coincidences
that have occurred

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:84%
with that and so
many other things

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.500 align:middle line:84%
as I've been in touch with
my mission and acting rightly

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:90%
is just incredible.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So spirit-filled is
such an important piece,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.902 align:middle line:90%
as you all know.

00:35:25.902 --> 00:35:28.362 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:28.362 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The next four areas are that
of wellness, overall wellness,

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:84%
holistic wellness,
integrated wellness.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:10%
Physical is one aspect
of that, as we said.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%
It's our bodies.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:90%
How are we eating?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:84%
What does food do--
and everything we take

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:90%
into our body, food and drink.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:90%
What does that do to our bodies?

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose?

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.324 align:middle line:90%
To provide what?

00:35:58.324 --> 00:35:59.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuel.

00:35:59.124 --> 00:36:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Nutrition.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Fuel and nourishment.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So out of the three criteria
that we pick for food

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of convenience,
taste, and nourishment,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.032 align:middle line:90%
where does nourishment rank?

00:36:15.032 --> 00:36:15.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Last.

00:36:15.884 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's last.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So think about where
you're ranking it

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of-- nourishment for
me is now an important piece.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Is convenience part?

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Is taste part?

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But nourishment's
important piece for me.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And just ask yourself, how am
I nourishing all the tissues

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and cells in my body?

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we take a pill and
we say, what will this pill do?

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what the
15 pounds of food, how

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.520 align:middle line:90%
that's affecting us each week?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, I went macrobiotic in '89.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Eat mostly organic foods.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm in a restaurant
and I can't get what I need,

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't stress out
about it either.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I did a long time
ago, but I don't now.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I do my very best.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:90%
So taking in healthy foods.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Whole foods.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many great
places to get whole foods here

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:90%
in the Twin Cities.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:90%
So food.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Very important piece.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Exercise.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I said-- exercise.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the benefits of
exercise, it's unbelievable.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Destressor.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Reduces chance of
heart disease by 60%.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Breast cancer by 64%.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Significantly reduces the
chance of prostate cancer,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.640 align:middle line:90%
colon cancer.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We're talking heavy duty
increase your clarity of mind.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they put all that
in a pill, it'd outsell Viagra.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:84%
That exercise is
great, great stuff.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I schedule
it as an appointment.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I got an appointment
with myself to go exercise.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And I get what I call--

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:84%
ever the good
businessman-- a good ROIT,

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.083 align:middle line:90%
return on invested time.

00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
If I exercise for an hour
and a half three times

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
a week, which I do, then that's
4 and 1/2, 5 hours a week.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.588 align:middle line:84%
Then for all the
rest of the time--

00:38:12.588 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and when I exercise
for an hour and a half,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I get 48 hours worth
of really feeling good.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Really clear-minded.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Really energetic.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And when I don't, I'm stressed.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So the food-- food
determines your mood--

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:84%
food and exercise, two
critical, critical pieces

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:90%
for our physical.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And we know that.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't like
new information.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.915 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you're
hearing something today

00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and you say, I've heard it,
rather than "I've heard it,"

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
ask yourself, am I doing it?

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.983 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to do it?

00:38:40.983 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to do it--
if you don't want to exercise

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.775 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
to eat right--

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:90%
no problem.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the other things that were
helpful for me were bodywork.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:90%
The energy work that I did.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
The chakra work was just
tremendously helpful.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a real blockage
in the heart.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It was like--

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I had just a ton of
work, the heart chakra,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:90%
to be able to feel more.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Intellectual wellness.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that a ton.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move--

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.755 align:middle line:84%
just think about, are you using
your right and left brain?

00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Or you're just using
your right or your left?

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Or are you using both?

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Are you taking in all the
information we have today?

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Or are you getting rid of the
information you don't need

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and taking information
that can benefit you,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and converting that to
knowledge and then to wisdom?

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It becomes knowledge
when you retain it.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It becomes wisdom
when you retain it

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and you use it with regard
to attaining your mission.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I talked about 10
different plays

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
in the book, plays
or methods to be

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
able to make behavioral
modifications.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:84%
One of those plays
is self-coaching.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
be sharp enough

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make those
behavioral changes just

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
by coaching yourself
and saying, OK, Tom.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to do this.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.483 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:40:10.483 --> 00:40:11.900 align:middle line:84%
That's something
you want to drop.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.817 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to do it.

00:40:12.817 --> 00:40:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't, don't, don't.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:90%
So you can coach yourself.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:90%
That's one option.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Another option is
that of books, tapes.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.015 align:middle line:84%
Another option is that of
what I call one-on-one.

00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:84%
One-on-one is a
great therapist to be

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
able to help move
me through these,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate team to
assist in the dropping

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:90%
of these behaviors.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The identification of them
and the dropping of them,

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:90%
or modifying.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
excellent, excellent way.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Then group therapy was another
important trait for me,

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:90%
or another play that helped me.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.943 align:middle line:84%
The group was
important because--

00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the one-on-one was great,
but the group really

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:90%
complemented it.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there
were retreats where

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we'd go on a one-week
retreat where

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
we're practicing these
behaviors in a full week,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:90%
stumbling here, stumbling there.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:10%
So those are some of the ways
in terms of psychological.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Spiritual wellness.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:10%
There are many ways for
spiritual practice we all know.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Prayer, meditation.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I meditate half an hour a day.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I also do what I call
affirmations that are sutras.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I learned it
from Deepak, where

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:84%
they are various one-word
affirmations that

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:90%
line up four per chakra.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:90%
So there's 28 of them.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's been a powerful,
powerful situation,

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
are those one-word sutras
which line up with each chakra.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the root chakra
is stability, flexibility,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.750 align:middle line:90%
coherence, and transformation.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's the four
that I say to myself,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and aim the consciousness
into that area.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:84%
For the crown, it's infinity,
immortality, enlightenment,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
and holy.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So I get real power out of
that when I say those words

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and visualize something that
reminds me of those words

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and aim it into those
areas, those energy centers.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.682 align:middle line:90%
So wise words.

00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of great books.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So 10 ways I talk about in
terms of spiritual practice.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.440 align:middle line:90%
That's practice.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Practice is important.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But the real game for me,
spiritual wellness, and really

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:84%
accessing spirit, is, how
am I showing up every day?

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Am I smiling at people, or
am I frowning at people?

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:10%
Am I encouraging people, or
am I discouraging people?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Am I forgiving people,
or am I holding grudges?

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Am I asking for forgiveness,
or am I saying, eh.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was a bad
idea to blow them off.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Am I holding the door?

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:84%
As I'm going through the door
and somebody's 10 feet behind,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:84%
am I holding it for them,
or am I letting it slam?

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
In my home, when I use the
last of the toilet paper,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:84%
am I replacing the roll, or
am I saying, let her do it?

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a million
different things that

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:90%
are what I call the real game.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have been talking
spiritual practice for 10 years

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is, how am
I showing up in the world?

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the other, for
me, is just practice.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And if I save myself, and
I'm not really connected

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
with others and being
a beneficial presence

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.170 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, then all
the practice, in my view,

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:90%
is for naught.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll end by saying I wish
you all the very best

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:84%
in winning in the
game of your life.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And on the trip, keep
things in perspective.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:90%
We know that life is messy.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.738 align:middle line:90%
It's challenging.

00:44:20.738 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Scott Peck says in his
book "Road Less Traveled,"

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:84%
first three words,
"Life is difficult."

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.990 align:middle line:90%
So it is messy.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But if we keep things
in perspective,

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.880 align:middle line:84%
keep these relationships, keep
our mission in perspective,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.440 align:middle line:90%
that can help.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And this message of keeping
things in perspective

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is best illustrated
with a letter

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that a young woman wrote
to her mom from college.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:84%
She says, dear
Mom, I thought I'd

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.200 align:middle line:84%
write to let you know what's
been going on here at school.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't get worried, but
my arm's in a cast.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I broke it yesterday
when I did jump out

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.240 align:middle line:84%
of the dorm window
because of the fire

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.550 align:middle line:84%
which was accidentally
started when Mary and I got

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.237 align:middle line:90%
too high smoking pot.

00:44:59.237 --> 00:45:01.522 align:middle line:90%

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.575 align:middle line:90%
They kept us in jail overnight.

00:45:05.575 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter it's
my writing hand that's

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:84%
broken because I'm going
to quit school next week

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:90%
and marry Johnny anyway.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Johnny's father has
offered him a partnership

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:90%
in his gas station in Alaska.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:90%
That really sounds swell.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.750 align:middle line:84%
There's an extra room
over the station which

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.240 align:middle line:84%
would be large enough at
least until the baby comes

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:90%
in a few months.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Hope things are
going well for you.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Love, Molly.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:34.112 align:middle line:90%
PS, there's no fire.

00:45:34.112 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't break my hand.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't smoke dope.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get put in jail.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't quit school.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't marry Johnny,
and I'm not pregnant.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.025 align:middle line:84%
However, I did get
a D in chemistry,

00:45:44.025 --> 00:45:46.525 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted you to put
things in a proper perspective.

Thank you.

00:45:54.483 --> 00:45:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Keep things in their
proper perspective,

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.377 align:middle line:84%
and I wish you all winning
in the game of your life.

00:45:58.377 --> 00:45:59.210 align:middle line:90%
