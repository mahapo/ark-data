00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello I'm Chantel Westerman
for Wisdom Television.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our "Wisdom
Workshop" series.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to note
that in the last 18 months,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.710 align:middle line:84%
nearly a quarter
of a million people

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
have come to Whole
Life Expos looking

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
for information about natural
health, personal growth,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and global change.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'd like to
invite you to join me

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:84%
as I walk the floor
of a Whole Life Expo,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:84%
attending the
workshops, and meeting

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
some of the best-selling
authors in the field.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:90%
You may be surprised.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
This world is a
lot more mainstream

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.812 align:middle line:90%
than you ever thought.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
In Phoenix, Whole
Life Expo attendees

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
were treated to
a special event--

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.756 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:09.042 align:middle line:84%
an appearance by the Tibetan
monks of Drepung Loseling.

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The monks are
particularly renowned

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.415 align:middle line:90%
for their multiphonic singing.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Each chant master simultaneously
intones three notes, thus

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.402 align:middle line:84%
creating a complete
cord with one voice.

In the Dance of the
Black Hat Masters,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.715 align:middle line:84%
the performers rejoice
in the elimination

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:90%
of negative energies.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
The Playful Yak Dance
symbolizes the joy

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
of all living creatures
when humans entered

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:90%
the realm of balanced living.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The Lamas also demonstrate
a traditional form

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
of monastic inquiry.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a lively debate
that brings them

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to deeper levels of
spiritual understanding.

00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I often would hear people go
to God asking God to send them

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:90%
a relationship.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that once
a relationship got here,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
how often they stopped talking
to God after that point.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:10%
You sort of see it symbolized
in the marriage ceremony.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:10%
You go to the
synagogue or the church

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:10%
on the day of the wedding,
but then you don't necessarily

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:10%
go back.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
There's this sense that we ask
God to send us a relationship.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We might even thank God
for the fact that He did.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But how little we actually
make the sacred dimension

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
of our lives a part of
our deepest relationships.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the modern
world, particularly

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
under the Christian
dispensation,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
has seen God over here
and sex over there.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
That's a large part
of the issue, which

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
has led us to think of
our romantic lives very,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
very separately from
our sacred lives.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm interested in is,
what role does spirituality

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
play in our romantic journey?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And what role does
our romantic journey

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:90%
play in our spiritual lives?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:10%
I know that I've had the
experience-- as many of us,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:10%
if not all of us have--

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:10%
of having been
very much in love.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:10%
And then, after a
certain period of time,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:10%
if a certain something didn't
continue, the world would say,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:10%
well, you know,
that wasn't real.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't real.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
That was just a delusion.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
That was just an infatuation,
and then reality set in.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
You've had that experience?

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:10%
But I've come to believe,
at this point in my life,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:10%
that that is the exact
opposite of the truth.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:90%
That was not delusion.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:90%
That was reality.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:10%
And then non-reality set in.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's Jennifer,
and there's John.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So how does the Holy
Spirit make assignments?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, theoretically,
the Holy Spirit

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
sees Jennifer and goes,
what Jennifer most needs

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
to learn in her life is
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And John-- John could be
in Timbuktu at that moment,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but the universe
says, John needs

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to learn blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Jennifer and
John knew each other,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that would provide the
maximal opportunities.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no one better
than John for Jennifer

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:90%
to learn with it this time.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no one better
than Jennifer than John

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.183 align:middle line:90%
to learn with at this time.

00:06:54.183 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the notion here
is that the universe is

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
like a gigantic bio-computer.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the universe
then conspires.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
John might think he's going to
spend the summer in Timbuktu.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Because he's needed to meet
Jennifer at her cousin's

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:90%
wedding in Cleveland.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So those two will be brought
together by cosmic forces.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is to say that
they are destined to meet.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
That is not to say that they
are destined to stay together.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Free will-- you know,
karma says you will meet.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Free will says what you will
do with the opportunity.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's going
on inside Jennifer,

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on inside John?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jennifer and John are
just like the rest of us.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Deep in their hearts, they yearn
for the deepest, truest love.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Jennifer
and John are human.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:10%
In "A Course in
Miracles," it says

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:10%
that our love for another
person, our deepest

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:10%
passion for another
person, is but a shadow--

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:10%
it's a shadow-- of
our love for God.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, in "Les
Miserable," there's

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that song where the words
go "to love another person

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:90%
is to see the face of God."

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a Heaven
that we yearn for.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
"The Course in Miracles"
says Heaven is not

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:90%
a place or condition.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It's an awareness.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we fall in
love with somebody,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
we have an awareness of
our oneness with them.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a merger on the
deepest level of our souls.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We bypass boundaries, not
in a dysfunctional way,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
but in the highest,
most transcendent way.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And we experience our oneness
with another human being.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of us do that,
all Heaven breaks loose.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So notice, a girlfriend
of mine once said,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I can only be with a man so long
before I have to kill him off.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I can only be with a man so long
before the color of his socks

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:90%
starts bothering me.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I can only be with a man
so long before the fact

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that he is not a perfect
human being becomes

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:90%
an unbearable fact to me.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
As I say often, if
you're not perfect,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
what perfect person
do you think is

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:90%
going to show up in your life.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
You're not perfect.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Why would they be perfect?

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's not even
to mention that I just

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.128 align:middle line:84%
don't think there are that many
enlightened masters dating.

00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of
situation is this

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
if we have no hope
of holding on to love

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
if someone not being perfect is
such a bitter disappointment?

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we are given,
from a spiritual perspective,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that the whole
point of the relationship

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
here to be healed.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That is, in fact, why
John and Jennifer met.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer is thinking, on
some level of her mind,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to meet a man in whose
love I can forget my wounds.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And God is saying, I'm
going to send Jennifer

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
a man with whom she
can address her wounds.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But she will only
be able to address

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
her wounds in a situation
where they come up.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So then, Jennifer might later
say, I don't like this guy.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:90%
He wounded me.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
When the truth of the matter
is he didn't wound her.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
He triggered her wounds that
she had before she even met him.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had to be
triggered in order for her

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to take a good look at them,
for her to forgive whoever--

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it was someone
else or herself.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Which now, at this
time, her mind probably

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is projecting it wasn't someone
else, and it wasn't her.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It was John.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And so she now has the
opportunity to heal.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But what usually happens,
or happens so often?

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
John says, I can't

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
deal with this woman's issues.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Or Jennifer says, I don't like
the way this guy makes me feel.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
What she's really
saying is, I don't

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
like the way the last 30 years
of my life have made me feel,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
but I'm coping.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But in his presence,
I can't even cope,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.163 align:middle line:90%
it comes up so strong.

00:11:32.163 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
In "A Course in
Miracles," this is

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
called the difference between
a special relationship

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and a holy relationship.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
A special relationship is where
Jennifer's ego meets John's ego

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.647 align:middle line:84%
and where Jennifer wants
John to be perfect somehow.

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to hide
her own imperfections,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.772 align:middle line:84%
because she figures if John
saw what she's really like,

00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:90%
he would probably reject her.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And John is doing the
same thing to Jennifer.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And if either one of them had
the audacity or the misfortune

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to show up as a
real human being,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:90%
they are likely to be rejected.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:10%
A holy relationship is where
John and Jennifer understand,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:10%
we both are wounded.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
That's why we were sent here.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Our love can be a
hospital for our souls.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And your stuff's
going to come up,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and my stuff's going to come up.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Often, not because we're
not meant for each other,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:90%
but because we are.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But we can make of this
relationship a sanctuary.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Mary, I come into
this a little bit skeptically.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think my skepticism
comes from not knowing

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
what aura video vision is.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This system will allow you
to interact live with your aura.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:10%
You'll actually be able to see
it live and what's happening

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:10%
and what's going on--

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:10%
all the responses to your
emotional, your mental,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:10%
and some of your
physical, as well.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So as we're talking
about different things,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
going to see a change

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and alter on screen
while that's happening.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> What is an aura, exactly?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, an aura is the
electromagnetic energy field

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:90%
around our body.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, all right.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that's alive has
it-- plants, animals, humans.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.555 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and slide your
fingers right into the sensor.

00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:18.513 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what's
happening with the sensor

00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is it's reading
off the acupuncture

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
points on your fingers.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Takes that information and
pulls it into your aura

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.882 align:middle line:84%
so we can take a
good look at it.

00:13:25.882 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
we're going to notice

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:90%
is you have a lot of blues.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You've got some greens.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is
right above your head,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
into the crown chakra.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I mention chakras, do
you understand what I'm talking

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk
about them a little bit,

00:13:38.313 --> 00:13:39.968 align:middle line:90%
for people who might not know.

00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, there's seven
energy centers on the body.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
They're called chakras.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They are all tied
into hormonal glands

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our bodies.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
This one happens to be the crown
chakra, the one way up on top

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that ties us into our higher
self, the more divine aspect

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.435 align:middle line:90%
about who and what we are.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I'm looking
at yours, you

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.692 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of blue, deep blues,
and you've got a lot of purple.

00:13:59.692 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, really, what that
tells me is you're

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the type of person who
really is in search

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:90%
for very deep information.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Not just on the surface or
shallow-type information,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.243 align:middle line:84%
but really the deeper aspect
of who and what you are.

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You're probably
the type of person

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that looks up into the stars
at night and goes, God,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
there's gotta be more
to life than just what I

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
experience on a regular basis,
because it shows up as that.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the violet?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the violent really is
the aspect of the visionary,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%
the higher intuitive.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.405 align:middle line:84%
So you're probably
extremely intuitive.

00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:90%
You just know things.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it right here.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
You get it in your
gut, and you know when

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
it's right, when it's wrong.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.557 align:middle line:84%
When you meet
people, you probably

00:14:34.557 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:90%
size them up very well.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
You just have that
inner intuitive knowing.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's
green on one side.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.992 align:middle line:90%
That comes and goes.

00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see a lot of
greens, it's about our tie-in

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to animals and into nature
and the ability to teach.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I'm thinking
about my dogs right now.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Whoo, look at the green
that just came up!

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you see
the greens pop up?

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Especially at your heart
center, because that obviously

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.642 align:middle line:84%
is an area for you
that's important.

00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of pops
up in that area,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.725 align:middle line:84%
and you get a lot of
green around that.

00:15:02.725 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so interesting.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that awesome?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.052 align:middle line:84%
So now, as we come up here, this
is your third eye center, OK?

00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we can tell
in relation to that

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:90%
is your third eye is above--

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
it's more up here into your
crown area instead of here

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:90%
where it should be.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.523 align:middle line:84%
>> That's because sometimes you
have a tendency to be a little

00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:90%
ungrounded.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You probably spend a
lot of time at night,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.667 align:middle line:84%
while you're sleeping,
out of your body,

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:90%
maybe doing a lot of traveling.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So you might have some pretty
active dreams at night.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
You might wake up in the
morning feeling pretty fatigued,

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
drained, like,
God, I feel like--

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> This is amazing.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --I didn't sleep at all.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> This is amazing, Mary.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
This is really, really
interesting stuff.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can tell a lot
from an aura when you know how

00:15:40.237 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to assimilate all that energy.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we can do is go
ahead now and just print out

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
your aura.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What that's going to do
is freeze you in that space.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, look at the--

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's going to
take it just a moment.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.485 align:middle line:90%
>> --space I got frozen in.

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sorry.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Although, the way I
was frozen in the picture,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
it kind of tells the
real story of me.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like, don't get too close.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, keep a
watchful eye out.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anything get
in there too closely.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Mary.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:90%
This has been great.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous.

but you know, I don't know why
there's such a bad rap attached

people immediately think of all
those ridiculous stereotypes,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:10%
They think of the green-faced
hag with the wart on her nose,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:10%
brewing up evil potions.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, a
lot of fundamentalists

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
think of Satanists, which
has absolutely nothing

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to do-- neither of them.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:90%
They're stereotypes.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
people think that is

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
because 500 years ago, the
Church accused practitioners

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of the old religion of the
Goddess of being Satanists.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So it started off with
the religion of the Goddess?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what it
was known as then?

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:50.041 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the ancient pre-Christian
religion of the Goddess.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.377 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ancient.

00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It goes back thousands of years.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It predates Judaism and
Christianity and Islam

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.002 align:middle line:90%
by thousands of years.

00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the
religion out of which

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Western civilization was born.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
7500 BC, the very first
evidence of the human effort

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to create civilization in all
of the various river valleys--

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the Tigris and
Euphrates, the Ganges,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:84%
which was named for the great
goddess Ganga, the Nile.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They were all
Goddess-worshipping cultures.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They all saw the divine
as present in the world.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.887 align:middle line:84%
They saw the body of the
Goddess in the Earth,

00:17:22.887 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and they worshipped the Goddess.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
old religion-- that's

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:90%
what witchcraft actually is.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the European
shamanic survival

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient religion
of the Goddess.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot like Native American
spirituality, in many ways,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's cosmology,
many practices.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Has a lot of
similarities to Taoism

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and Australian
aboriginal wisdom.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing to know.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I would have never known that.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you go back in
Greek mythology, of course,

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:90%
like Isis--

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, a great
ancient Egyptian goddess,

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
a magnificent figure.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
When a woman sees an
image of the Goddess,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:90%
she's looking in a mirror.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And she sees herself--

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:90%
perhaps for the first time--

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way that the culture
of the world that we live in

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
has never allowed
her or encouraged her

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:90%
or helped her to see herself.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
She sees herself as wise.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:90%
She sees herself as powerful.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
She sees herself as
creative, dynamic, healing,

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, no matter
what she looks like.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:10%
And I think, for
men, that when they

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:10%
look at an image of the
Goddess, they see healing,

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:10%
and they see permission
to have their feelings,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:10%
to be spontaneous, to
be sexual, to retrieve

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:10%
the part of themselves
that they've

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:10%
lost because the culture has
placed such emphasis on what

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:10%
I think of as a very
distorted kind of masculinity.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So 500 years ago,
the Church went

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
after practitioners of the
old religion of the goddess

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
They were competition, had
a very different experience

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had absolutely
no familiarity

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:90%
with any of this history.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what had happened.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The struggle that
women have today--

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
for equal rights, for equal
pay, for equal opportunities--

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
stem from what happened to them
500 years ago during the witch

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:84%
craze, which was really
a women's Holocaust.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They lost all of
their legal rights.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't receive
an education.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't practice the
old religion of the Goddess.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
that it went underground.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And to the victors went the
spoils and the opportunity--

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> --to retell history,
and the lie grew.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did the
word "witch" come in?

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Because goddess is so
lovely and so powerful.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.725 align:middle line:84%
But almost anybody I know, when
you say a witch, they go, ugh.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Even when it's somebody
you don't like,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
you're not actually calling
her a witch, but you say,

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.645 align:middle line:90%
she's such a witch.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, on the soap operas,
they do it all the time,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
because they won't
use the B-word.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:90%
So they use the W-word.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Susan Lucci has said that a lot.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.097 align:middle line:84%
And the witch has
actually become,

00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I think, a repository for
the culture's fear of women--

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --which you
see 500 years ago.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I call
myself a witch, I'm

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
very clear that I'm taking
back my power as a woman,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
because the damage that was done
to women and the damage that

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
was done to the old
religion of the Goddess.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Those two things are
inextricably intertwined.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But the word "witch" is actually
an old Anglo-Saxon word--

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Wicca, W-I-C-C-A. And it
means a wise one or a shaman.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.405 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what it is.

00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> How interesting is that?

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, Wicca is the organization.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think of
it as a religion?

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I try not to.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:10%
When I think of
religion, I immediately

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:10%
start thinking of hierarchies.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think of theology,
which I think has left us

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:10%
in a terrible state.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:10%
I think of it as a
spiritual practice,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.030 align:middle line:10%
because that's what it is.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not a belief system.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a system of practices.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And they are remarkable.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They are shamanic
practices, what

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
we call core shamanic
techniques, active meditations,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
usually done in the
presence of nature.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, nature
is a spiritual nature.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are a
means of communing

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.098 align:middle line:84%
with the divine, of seeing
the sacred in yourself

00:21:07.098 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and in the world around you, in
other people and in the Earth

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And are they
organized rituals?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, when we
think of Catholic, Muslim,

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Judaism, you think of churches.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:90%
You think of synagogues.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
You think of temples.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.195 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't have buildings.

00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They're very useful to have
if it gets particularly

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:84%
hot or particularly cold,
but for us, the Earth

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
itself is sacred.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we work in
a circle, which

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor for the
divine, for the feminine.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It is also an expression
of an essential equality.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-hierarchical
spiritual practice.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is equal in a circle.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
There is a priest, a priestess,
but they're teachers.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What they are doing is
teaching other people

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
how to use these
practices themselves.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a priest?

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So there are men in Wicca?

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, increasingly.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, see, this
is interesting.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Increasingly.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.665 align:middle line:84%
>> This is interesting,
because I think a lot

00:22:01.665 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
of the misconceptions
about Wicca are among--

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I should rephrase that.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Among the misconceptions
about Wicca,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's that
it's all women.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.005 align:middle line:84%
Well, that grew out of the
persecution and the fact

00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
that 90% of the people tortured
and murdered were women.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And so from that, you got the
idea that witches were women.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, all
of our ancestors

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.632 align:middle line:84%
were practicing this
ancient religion--

00:22:24.632 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's a circle?

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> --men and women.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.182 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we work in a circle.

00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
It's called casting a circle.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
creation or the recognition

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:90%
of sacred space.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And very similar
to Native American

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.910 align:middle line:90%
spirituality in that way.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And then there is an honoring
of the four directions--

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom and the
powers and the spirits

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:90%
of the four directions.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And then we begin to work.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We will invoke a goddess,
a god, which we understand

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor, an expression
of a particular aspect

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.237 align:middle line:84%
of divine energy that is
appropriate to the work

00:22:59.237 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that-- the spiritual,
sacred work that we're

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
doing at the time, whether
it's healing or love or peace

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual enlightenment.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's really
an active meditation.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:90%
We create ritual.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very personal,
very dynamic.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:10%
You can create rituals that
are very personally meaningful.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.730 align:middle line:10%
Or there is the
ancient rituals, which

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:10%
we have retrieved from the
Greek, from the Celtic,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:10%
from the Scandinavian,
the Romanian, the French.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
We are actively engaged in a
kind of academic archeology,

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
pulling out these
ancient practices.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually
done to correspond

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:84%
with the natural rhythms
of Earth and Moon

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and Sun, because we're
seeking to attune ourselves

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
to the natural cycles
of the Earth, of nature.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, as I said,
nature is a spiritual teacher.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And by attuning ourselves
to those rhythms,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
there is a great
wisdom that is provided

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to us that helps us to
live in a sacred manner.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.404 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.404 --> 00:24:03.338 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:10%


00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:10%
>> We are obsessed-- a
nation obsessed with age,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:10%
getting older.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:10%
Why are we so
uncomfortable with it?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think
there are two things.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:10%
One is we don't have to get old.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And two, we worry about some
of the disabilities of old age.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:10%
But the neat thing, the great
thing from our research,

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:10%
is you can live both
younger and with a shorter

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:10%
period of disability
at the end of life

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:10%
if you make easy choices,
really easy choices--

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:10%
for instance, just
changing to olive oil.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a Misto,
a little sprayer,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:90%
so you can use less fat.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:90%
You need some fat.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You need about 25% of
your diet to be fat,

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and it should be healthy fats.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And the worst fat is
margarine-- trans fat.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It's partially hydrogenated
oils, if you look on the label.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Switching from those to
healthy monounsaturated fat

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:84%
makes you over
four years younger.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What about this this?

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Is fat-free tomato sauce.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
There are two reasons
we have fat-free stuff.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to think that
fat is fattening,

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
because it has nine calories
per ounce, if you will.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Having fat with your
food is much more caloric

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
than having fat free, but
it isn't necessarily better.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
We need fat for a couple
of reasons, one of which

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.180 align:middle line:90%
is to absorb the nutrients.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.705 align:middle line:84%
So tomato paste has
wonderful nutrients in it.

00:25:30.705 --> 00:25:32.255 align:middle line:90%
It keeps you younger.

00:25:32.255 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
There are a total
of nine studies

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
in humans that 10
tablespoons of tomato

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:84%
paste a week decrease your risk
of prostate cancer 40% to 50%

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and actually decrease the risk
of nine other cancers by about

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:90%
the same amount.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But you don't absorb the tomato
sauce, the lycopene in it,

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.397 align:middle line:90%
if you have it fat free.

00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about
something like rice?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I know that was a
big deal in the book.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you want to eat--

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:10%
there only are about 20 rules of
eating, and they're in the book

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:10%
and they're on the website.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's easy to learn the 20.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But the first is,
eat what you like.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:90%
So eat the best foods.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Make it wonderful foods.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The second is eat nutrient
rich, calorie poor.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So you want to eat things
with a lot of nutrients in it.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the worst
foods white rice,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:84%
because they've taken all the
nutrients out, and all you get

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
is the calories.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, a good
food is long grain wild rice.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't take much
longer to cook it--

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:10%
maybe a minute longer to cook
this versus the white rice--

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:10%
and it's much, much
healthier, because it's

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:10%
got all the nutrients in it.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have
complex carbohydrates,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
but you want to have them
with the nutrients in them.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we go any further,
let's tell the audience where

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
they can find the RealAge
quiz on the internet.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's at
www.realage.com.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:10%
It's realage.com.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:10%
It's the easiest thing.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Four million people have taken--
a little over four million

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:90%
have taken the RealAge quiz now.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> For the people who
have not read the book,

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
the RealAge quiz is a quiz
you take that determines what?

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are five
actual components to it.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But the first one
is it tells you

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:84%
whether you're aging faster or
slower than your calendar age.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, all of us
want to be younger.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So it tells you whether
you are younger or not.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a landmark
of where you are.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The second thing it does is it
tells you all those choices you

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:90%
have to make yourself younger.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So it tells you what you're
doing that get you older

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and also what things you can
do to make yourself younger.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it does a
very important thing--

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:90%
it values each choice for you.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, it
might say that having

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
10 helpings of tomato paste
for the average man a week,

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
10 helpings of tomato
sauce or tomato paste,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
will make him 8/10
of a year younger.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So he knows that if he starts
that now, within three years,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
he gains almost a
full year younger.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But it does that with
each of your choices.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:84%
For everything else in
life, we have targets.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What this does is says, you
can rate everything in health

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
by its age effect
and then have a goal.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you another place
where I and a lot of my friends

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
who took your quiz lost
points and became younger--

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:90%
flossing.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Flossing-- that is,
preventing periodontal

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:90%
disease--

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:90%
is a huge benefit.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it make your smile
look great, but in addition,

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
the bacteria

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that set up periodontal
disease, that cause

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:84%
disease in your
oral cavity, set up

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
an immune reaction which
attacks your arteries

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and makes your arteries
older if you have it.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
By flossing, by preventing that,
you make your arteries younger.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways you can
prevent wrinkling as well as

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
keep your arteries younger
and keep your memory intact,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
prevent impotence, keep
quality of orgasm high.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Prevent heart disease and
stroke is to floss your teeth.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an easy one.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought I would begin
a sentence like this, Michael,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:84%
but speaking of orgasms, how
does sex play a role in being

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:90%
younger, staying younger?

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't know why
it makes you younger,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:10%
but it actually decreases your
rate of aging in all three

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:10%
components.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps your
arteries younger,

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
it keeps your immune
system younger,

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and it shortens or
lessens the chance

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of environmental and social
factors causing aging.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think it's because
of the companionship,

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the intimacy, the relationship
and decreasing stress.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:90%
But no one knows why.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a different factor for
men and women, as you know.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
For men, it's number of
orgasms a year, if you will,

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that correlates.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.230 align:middle line:84%
For women, it's
quality of orgasm.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
The more sex you have,
the younger you are.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
really amazed me was--

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
see if I'm right
on this, Michael.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
When you take vitamins,
it's a minus 6.5

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
or something in
the RealAge book.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a strong amount younger.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't take vitamins.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, if I
eat the right foods.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was something
that surprised me.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:90%
What vitamins?

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Surprised me, too.

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
None of my patients-- even I
don't eat balanced enough diet

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to get the right
amount of multivitamins

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:90%
to prevent deficiency disease.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So I take a
multivitamin every day,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and I tell my patients
to take what's

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
called an RDA, or daily
value, multivitamin every day.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, there
are more vitamins

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that you take that
help optimize health,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's a pretty easy
mnemonic to remember--

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
CDEF, calcium and magnesium.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's the alphabet, CDEF,
and then calcium and magnesium

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and the number 400.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What does F do for us?

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> F is not vitamin F, but
it's folic acid, or folate.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a B vitamin.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.692 align:middle line:84%
I just remember it that way,
because it fits with CDEF.

00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And the second part you have
to remember is the number 400.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.850 align:middle line:90%
So even I can remember this.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:84%
400 milligrams of vitamin
C three times a day.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Why do you need it
more than once a day?

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it's water soluble,
and you urinate it out.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So in order to keep a
steady level, you need 400,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and you need it
three times a day.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D, 400 international
units once a day.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin E, 400 international
units once a day.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Folate, or folic acid, 400 mcg
more than a diet once a day.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Calcium, 400 three times a day.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.625 align:middle line:84%
Calcium you can
take all at once.

00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:40.958 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to spread it out.

00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Especially for women.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And magnesium, 400.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.213 align:middle line:84%
Well, calcium is very
important for men, too.

00:31:46.213 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The reason we think it's more
important-- the reason we've

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
associate it's more
important with women

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
is because women tend
to live longer than men.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's in their older age
that they get osteoarthritis

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and they get osteoporosis,
both of which

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
are helped greatly
by having calcium.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Men build up bigger bones
when they're younger.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So when they fall
when they get older,

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
they don't have quite
the number of fractures.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And they die of other
things before women.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, we've thought it
isn't as important for men,

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's just as
important for men.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's especially
important preventing

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:90%
arthritis or osteoarthritis.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Do women or men
age more quickly?

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it turns out that
until age 50, men age quicker.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, those women who
don't take hormone replacement

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
therapy age quicker.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
By age 66, men and
women catch up.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, men never quite
catch up to women,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's why women
tend to live longer.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, right now, in the
RealAge book, as we look at it,

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
both men and women can change
their rate of aging greatly.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the last 12
years in America,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in fact, men have aged as
a group, believe it or not,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:90%
only 9.7 years--

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:90%
women, about 10.9 years.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So men are doing
things to catch up

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to the slower rate of
aging that women have now.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So if the world stood
still right now, Michael,

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was listening to
you and everybody could hear,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.690 align:middle line:84%
would you give men different
advice than you would women

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
in terms of aging?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'd give everyone
the same advice.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Take the RealAge program,
find out your options,

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and then choose some you want.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what is
easy for you may be

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.740 align:middle line:90%
difficult for me and vice versa.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But we all have some
things that we can

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:90%
do that are relatively easy.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
My most successful patients
start with three or four things

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:84%
from the RealAge book--
read the chapters

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:84%
as well as pick
them out, so they

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:90%
know and understand what to do.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, after 90
days, they're doing

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
two or three of the three or
four things they've chosen,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and they add one.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And they incrementally add.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, they're
getting much younger

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and feeling more
vigorous and knowing

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:84%
that they'll be around to
care for their loved ones,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.696 align:middle line:84%
rather than having to be
cared for by their loved ones.

00:34:14.696 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
How did this whole
program start?

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It started by someone
who was smoking.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:90%
One of my friends--

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a friend at that
time, was a patient--

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:90%
came to my office.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
He was having an
operation on his leg.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.449 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't walk from here
to one third of the way

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:10%
to the other side of
the room without having

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.985 align:middle line:10%
to stop two or three times.

00:34:38.985 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:84%
He was smoking and wasn't
getting enough blood flow

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
into his legs.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.281 align:middle line:90%
So he said, what's my risk, Doc?

00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:84%
The surgeon has told
me that I don't have

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:90%
much risk, because I'm only 49.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Simon,
if you were only 49,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.860 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't have much risk.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But you're smoking makes you
at least eight years older.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't be.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why not?

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
no man in my family

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:84%
has lived to their
50th birthday,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and I got a birthday
in two weeks.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, my job is
partially to reassure patients.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the job of a physician.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'd done
the right thing.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Simon,
you can get younger.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:84%
If you stop smoking today,
you get one year younger

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:84%
in two months and two years
younger in five months.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And he stopped smoking that day.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't bright
enough to put it

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:84%
together as how good a
motivational tool this was

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.743 align:middle line:84%
till about eight
years later, when

00:35:30.743 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing another patient
who wasn't taking their blood

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:90%
pressure pills.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have every
one of my patients

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.577 align:middle line:84%
bring all their
pills in with them.

00:35:38.577 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So he brought two bottles
of blood pressure pills.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.280 align:middle line:90%
His name was Martin.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was half
empty, and one of them

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:84%
was hardly touched, and his
blood pressure was 140 over 90.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were both renewed
from-- the pharmacy data

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.545 align:middle line:90%
on them, it was the same date.

00:35:51.545 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Martin, you're
not taking your blood pressure

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.337 align:middle line:84%
pills the way you
should, are you?

00:35:55.337 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:90%
He said, how do you know?

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
half of one pill

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.857 align:middle line:90%
is meh, not much of the other.

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, what
difference does it make?

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You said my blood
pressure is 140 over 90,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and many doctors wouldn't
even treat me for 140 over 90,

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:90%
would they?

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, but it
makes you five years older

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.037 align:middle line:84%
than if your blood
pressure were 115 over 75.

00:36:15.037 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, you live as though--

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.400 align:middle line:90%
he was 47 at the time.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.272 align:middle line:84%
You live as though
you're 52, not 47.

00:36:23.272 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:84%
You live with the vigor
and vitality of someone

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:90%
who's five years older.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, show me the data.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.170 align:middle line:84%
He'd been a physics
major in college.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So I showed him
the data, which was

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:90%
from a VA cooperative study.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:10%
And he said, how many
other things in medicine

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:10%
can you do that for?

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why do
you want to know?

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
this is really powerful.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.663 align:middle line:84%
People have told me
I might die a year

00:36:45.663 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
or two early if I don't
take my blood pressure

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
pills the way I'm
supposed to, but no one

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.042 align:middle line:90%
has told me I'd live older.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he repeated
the question--

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
how many other things in
medicine can you do this for?

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how much will
it cost me to find out?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I know some
epidemiologist at Stanford

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and some at Hopkins,
and I know the person

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.060 align:middle line:84%
who runs the Health Risk
Assessment Project for the CDC

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.467 align:middle line:90%
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:37:07.467 --> 00:37:09.675 align:middle line:84%
And then we need a statistician,
because all this is,

00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is putting his net present
value of health changes,

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.272 align:middle line:84%
just like people do net
present value of investments.

00:37:15.272 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK, how
much will that cost?

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, about $25,000.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll need two meetings and
some research assistant time.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
To my surprise, he
reached into his pocket,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
pulled out his checkbook, wrote
a check for $25,000, and said,

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I want the answer in six weeks.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, we gave him the answer
in about 10 weeks, and we said,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you could do it for
60 to 70 things.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how much
will it cost to do it?

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
much more expensive.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of time.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's probably at least $10,000
for each item, maybe $50,000.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It's probably 800,000
to a million and a half.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, he
reached into his pocket,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
pulled out his checkbook,
wrote a check for $50,000,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and said, get started.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll help you raise
the rest of the money.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
started this project.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who is the
developer of the RealAge

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:84%
website so you can
take the RealAge

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.210 align:middle line:84%
program free on the
web at www.realage.com.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:84%
The long program is what
I urge you to now take.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Its 45 minutes, but don't
worry, you can do it in modules.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can do five minutes
here and five minutes there

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:90%
till you get all of it entered.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing is
remember your password,

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:84%
because you can go back and
update your record anytime

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:90%
and find out your real age.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's
never too late,

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in a nursing
home or you're here.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
There are always things
you can do to get younger,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.249 align:middle line:84%
and it's never too
late to get younger.

00:38:39.249 --> 00:38:42.087 align:middle line:10%

>> Competing with a man, it's
not even about good or bad.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:10%
It's stupid.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%

Pat Ellen tells a great
story that I always remember.

00:38:57.312 --> 00:38:58.770 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about
this whole idea

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of showing respect
for a man's thoughts--

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:84%
instead of competing, showing
respect for man's thoughts.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great story,
I think, about competition.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:84%
She says, a man and a woman
are going to a dinner party,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and before they go
to a dinner party,

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:90%
they go to a cocktail party.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:84%
They get to the dinner party,
and somebody says to them,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.930 align:middle line:84%
were you over at the cocktail
party over at the hotel?

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says,
yeah, we were there.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the person at the dinner
party says, how many people

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:90%
were over there?

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says, oh, I think
there were about 75 people.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And the woman, the competitive,
woman says, uh, darling,

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:90%
there were not 75 people there.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:90%
There were 30 people.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Then she even says to the
person who asked, trust me,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
there were maybe 30.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.110 align:middle line:10%
This is a woman who
will lose her man.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, the women in the
audience at Pat Allen

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.628 align:middle line:84%
would say, now, wait a
minute, but what if there were

00:39:54.628 --> 00:39:57.913 align:middle line:90%
only 30 people at the party?

00:39:57.913 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you expect me to do?

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of pretend I
don't know what I know?

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.088 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not about pretending
you don't know what you know.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's about showing respect
for this man's thoughts,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:90%
especially in public.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So women would say, well,
what should the woman

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:90%
do in that situation?

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Pat Allen says, just
kind of look at him.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.730 align:middle line:84%
He just said there
were 75 people there,

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and you just kind
of look at him.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.617 align:middle line:84%
It's a very good chance he's
going to look at you and say,

00:40:22.617 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:84%
How many people do
you think were there?

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
say something like,

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.915 align:middle line:90%
I thought there were fewer.

00:40:28.915 --> 00:40:32.265 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.265 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he might
even say, well,

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.070 align:middle line:84%
how many people do
you think were there?

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.656 align:middle line:90%
I thought there were about 30.

00:40:39.656 --> 00:40:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, she says, if
you do that, if you

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:47.220 align:middle line:84%
do that, later at night, just
about before you get into bed,

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:84%
he will turn to you
and say, you know,

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there were about 30
people there at that party.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:90%
See the difference?

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Respect was shown
for his thoughts.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Respect was shown
for his thoughts.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, from the
way I see those things

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
about competition with a man,
I can do it if I want to do it.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have to
decide what I want.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to win the argument,
or do I want the man?

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the real argument
is not about the facts.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.870 align:middle line:84%
The real argument is
about that push/pull

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:90%
that is not comforting.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And a man wants to feel
comfort from a woman.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of
the relationship.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.125 align:middle line:90%
He's doing that stuff all day.

00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:90%
He's doing that stuff.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, isn't that what we want?

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that what we want?

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.370 align:middle line:84%
To me, the secret
of a relationship

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
is how many times we can tell
each other how fabulous we

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:90%
are on any given day.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.940 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
How many ways were you
able to tell him today

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.430 align:middle line:90%
how fantastic he is?

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:84%
How many ways today were
you able to tell him

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.390 align:middle line:90%
how brilliant he is?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.990 align:middle line:84%
How many ways today
are we able to tell him

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%
how wonderful he is?

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We can talk, we can go
into all this stuff--

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.620 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff-- but let's
be really, really honest

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves-- that's it.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because what is it that
we want to be told?

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.890 align:middle line:84%
We want to be told
that we're wonderful.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to learn
how, when somebody says,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.437 align:middle line:84%
you're wonderful, you can say,
well, I might be wonderful,

00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:21.023 align:middle line:90%
but you're even more wonderful.

00:42:21.023 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:84%
People are wonderful,
and they hear all day,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
every day that they're not.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And they deserve to come home
to you and hear that they are.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's about.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what home is
supposed to be, right?

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what home
is supposed to be.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Home is supposed to be where
somebody isn't on your case

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The challenge of marriage is
to not let the routine begin

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:90%
to define the relationship.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to protect
mystery in a relationship.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to protect the
magic in a relationship.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.380 align:middle line:10%
You have to be careful not to
let the worldly things take up

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:10%
the whole screen.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.240 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you need
a sacred dimension.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Only a sacred dimension,
because a sacred dimension is

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:90%
another place in consciousness.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The thinking of the world is
a destroyer of the sacred.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of us spend-- you
know, we're on the Earth.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:90%
We have jobs.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:90%
We have lives.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We spend a lot of time in
the worldly dimensions.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's in a
relationship with ourselves

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
or relationship with
another human being,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.600 align:middle line:90%
we have to build a temple.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And you need a temple in your
home and in your practice

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:84%
together and in your
prayers together

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and your meditations together.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And ask God to make you the
mother that he would make you.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And ask Him to make you the
wife that he would have you be.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And pray together for your
child, and pray for each other.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you,
that's really--

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual
perspective, from a faith

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:90%
perspective, that's it.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
realize how potent,

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.470 align:middle line:84%
how powerful prayer
and meditation

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:90%
are until you don't do them.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.063 align:middle line:90%
That's why people are saying--

00:44:06.063 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:84%
most people know me better
than to say this anymore,

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.520 align:middle line:90%
but people say, yeah, yeah.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know about prayer.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I know about meditation.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, what else can I do?

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I just told you, well, here's
the most powerful force

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.620 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:90%
You could try that.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And people are like, yeah,
yeah, but what else can I do?

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that make sense?

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:90%
One more.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I recently-- my wife and I,
we've been together 20 years.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've recently taken on,
for my life and her life,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:90%
a domain in our life called--

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I want to get it right--

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.410 align:middle line:90%
outrageous romance, you know?

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Like a full, self-expressed
love of my wife--

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:84%
not just for us, but
like a model for our kids

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and their kids and their kids.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to thank you,
from my soul, this opportunity,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:90%
having us be here.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's new.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, this spiritual
path that you speak of

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.410 align:middle line:90%
is new for me.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a new experience, and it is
absolutely the most enlivening

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:90%
space I can be in.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like, yeah.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what's been missing.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we wish we could
just make you into pill form.

00:45:56.726 --> 00:45:59.534 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:59.534 --> 00:46:00.938 align:middle line:90%


00:46:00.938 --> 00:46:02.719 align:middle line:90%
Can we take him home?

00:46:02.719 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We're thrilled for both
of you, and we mean it.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I think we cry at
weddings because we

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:14.950 align:middle line:84%
feel, subconsciously,
somewhere deep down,

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:84%
if they could have it,
we could all have it.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I really want to
let you know, each of you,

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that it truly is available
in your lives to have

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:84%
a rock-your-world romance with
the partner that you're with.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> How wonderful.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And all it takes is your
speaking it into reality.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:90%
You speak it.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
what practices you

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:46.310 align:middle line:84%
can put into place to have that
happen, to keep it in reality.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:50.810 align:middle line:84%
One of those practices, for
me, is like flowers forever.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that my wife
has fresh flowers around her

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.037 align:middle line:90%
Because I got that that's a--

00:46:58.037 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> See, it's interesting
you say that.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.340 align:middle line:10%
Some men would say--

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.465 align:middle line:10%
I have a part in my book
about this idea of a woman

00:47:02.465 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:10%
being high maintenance.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's high maintenance,
to give a woman flowers

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.610 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Women have got to
stop apologizing

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.442 align:middle line:90%
for being high maintenance.

00:47:14.442 --> 00:47:17.418 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:17.418 --> 00:47:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Damn right I'm high maintenance.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Does a Jaguar or a
Rolls Royce apologize

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:90%
for being high maintenance?

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Does the most gorgeous
house apologize

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.140 align:middle line:90%
for being high maintenance?

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The men I know, what they're
really looking for deep inside,

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.568 align:middle line:90%
is a woman--

00:47:35.568 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:84%
they're not really looking
for a low-maintenance woman.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for a woman
that makes them really want

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.510 align:middle line:90%
to maintain at a high level.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A guy doesn't really want
to not bring her flowers.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.215 align:middle line:84%
He wants to meet a
woman that he really

00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:49.830 align:middle line:90%
wants to bring flowers to.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right?

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So why would a woman
go around saying, oh,

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:90%
you have to bring me flowers.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:84%
On every level, your
energy should just

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.422 align:middle line:84%
exude, what kind of idiot are
you that you wouldn't bring me

00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:04.222 align:middle line:90%
flowers?

00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a woman that
the guy wouldn't even conceive

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of not bringing you flowers.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.133 align:middle line:84%
You need to be a woman that
a man would think, oh, I bet

00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:15.430 align:middle line:90%
a woman like that gets flowers.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Damn right.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Your wife, obviously,
has this down.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.080 align:middle line:90%
She's taught you well.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for sharing.

00:48:27.434 --> 00:48:28.652 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:28.652 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It was really lovely
to be here with you.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.480 align:middle line:10%
