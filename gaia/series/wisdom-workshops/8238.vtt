>> It is only through a shift or
a change in consciousness from

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
the world of form to the world
spirit that we will be able

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
to eliminate and eradicate
the kinds of things that are

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:10%
so sorrowful to all of us.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:10%

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:10%
I took 60 days about
a year and a half

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:10%
ago to write 60 essays based
upon 60 of the greatest

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:10%
teachers that have
ever influenced my life

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:10%
or ever walked among us.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
There were many great
teachers who, perhaps we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
think they're now
gone, but their spirit

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
is something that we will
always be connected to.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is that
spirit that I wanted

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to address in this most
important undertaking

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:90%
of my life up until now.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And I set aside these 60 days.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And in those 60 days,
I decided that I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
would try to challenge
myself like I had never

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
been challenged before.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:10%
I was going to take,
on each given day,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:10%
I was going to wake up at 4 AM.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I would take the person
that I was highlighting.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would read all I
could about their lives,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
what their lives were like.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.797 align:middle line:84%
Because as much as what they
had to say is significant,

00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
a big part of what I want to
share with you this evening

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
is what are people like
who live at the highest

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And after seven or eight
hours of immersing myself

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
in their work, I
would take an hour,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
walk and meditate.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take the
afternoon for seven or eight

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
hours, and I would look at all
that they had contributed--

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
their poetry, their
statesmanship,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
their drawings if they
were artists, whatever it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:90%
was that they had contributed.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And then again, I would
meditate and get very quiet.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would take a picture,
or a sculpture, or a bust,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and I would look at that
picture, or that drawing,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:90%
or that bust.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask the
question, what would you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
say to the people
who are here today?

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me write it.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And then I would get very quiet.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And this may sound
a little strange.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you surrender, when you
let go, when you turn it over,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
when you surrender the
little mind to the big mind

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and you allow something
greater inside of you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that you are always connected
to but you sometimes

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
feel separate from,
when you allow

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
this to be the
force in your life,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
the most miraculous
things begin to happen.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, in a
book called How to Know God,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the third essay that I
wrote was written by a man

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
that no one had any pictures,
the only person that there were

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:90%
no pictures of or no drawings.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
His name was Patanjali.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we don't
even know when he lived.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhere between the
third and the fourth century

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:90%
before Christ.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:10%
And his great
writings were found

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:10%
and were called the
original yoga sutras.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:10%
There were four of them.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And in those yoga
sutras, Patanjali

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
talked about how to go within
and not know about God,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
not believe in God, but
how to come to know God.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Knowing in such a way that
you make conscious contact,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
so that all doubt
about whether or not

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
you and God are connected
is diminished and banished

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
from your life.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And in How to Know God,
I began to practice

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:90%
some of those sutras.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I read them one page at a time
for almost a year, each day,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:90%
one day.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would practice these
sutras, which are really

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
sort of like almost affirmations
that you make inside

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of you from a
perspective of surrender.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
and astonishing things

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
began to happen in my life.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I began to feel lighter.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
My arms would feel almost as
if they were like feathers.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would get up from
one of those experiences

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'd put my leg
down, and it was

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:90%
like there was no leg there.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
being stoned, I

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
guess, without having to go
through all of that poisons.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very light,
wonderful feeling.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:10%
And then one time when I
was doing this in my office,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:10%
I noticed that my body
began to move and rise.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.545 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of this
will sound weird.

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And I guess when it
does, I'll point it

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
out so that you don't
think I don't know--

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.883 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
--that some of this is going
to sound weird tonight.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just telling
you my experience.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I watched myself
lift up off the ground

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and go back down in this
ecstatic state of bliss

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
practicing these sutras on how
to know God, where I literally

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
was able to see my body
but not be a part of it.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And it lifted up again.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%
And then my ego got in it.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.281 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, boy, I could
go on "The Tonight Show."

00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was never
able to do it again.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:90%
As soon as the ego got involved.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Saint Paul said, that which
is seen, that which is seen

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
hath not come from
that which doth appear.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
That is, the source
of everything

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
over here in the physical world
is not in the physical world.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to be able
to reach the highest

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness
and awareness, which

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is what this evening
will be about,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
you have to figure out a way to
get out of the world of form.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And Patanjali, writing
somewhere 300 or 400 years

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
before Christ and after
Buddha, said these words

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
that I laminated.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And they are the part
of the third essay

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:90%
in Wisdom of the Ages.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
He said, when you are inspired--

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
now, the word inspired
comes from in spirit.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The word information
comes from in form.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So that when you are in form, in
the physical body, what you get

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is information, lots and
lots of information--

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
stuff, data.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is something that I'm
moving away from in my life,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:90%
less information.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an email.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a cell phone.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an
answering machine.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting rid of my telephone.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I want less information because
it has a tendency for me--

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and again, I'm just,
I have the mic, OK,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like what I'm
saying is true for everyone.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But you came to hear
what I have to say.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of it you'll like
and some of it won't like.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's all fine.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in form,
you get information.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And you get inundated with it.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're a culture
that's becoming

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:90%
inundated with information.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in spirit,
what you get is inspiration.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And Patanjali put it this way--

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
when you are inspired
by some great purpose,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
some extraordinary project,
all of your thoughts

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:90%
break their bonds.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Your mind transcends
limitations.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:10%
Your consciousness expands
in every direction.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself in a new
and great and wonderful world.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Then he said the part
that really blows me away.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:10%
He said-- dormant forces--

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:10%
that is, forces that
are not active--

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:10%
dormant forces, faculties,
and talents come alive.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And you discover yourself to
be a greater person by far

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
than you ever dreamed
yourself to be.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Those are the most
powerful words

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
for transforming your life,
your community, our world

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:90%
that I know.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:10%
When we lose our
connection to spirit,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:10%
we lose our capacity to be able
to get past the world of form

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and all of the
things and the evils

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:10%
that get represented by it.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:10%
It is only through a shift
or a change in consciousness

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:10%
from the world of form
to the world of spirit

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:10%
that we will be able to
eliminate and eradicate

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.551 align:middle line:10%
the kinds of things that are
so sorrowful to all of us.

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:10.435 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to now move on
to an explanation of what

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:10%
this higher level of
consciousness looks like.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:10%


00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:10%
If you can think of a
continuum along this stage

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:10%
with over here representing
point A, that is, to the far

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:10%
left.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll use the carpet
here as the endpoint.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And point A is represented
right here by this speaker.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Point B is right
here in the center.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.026 align:middle line:84%
And point C is where the
speaker is at my right.

00:11:57.026 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
All right, that's the whole
continuum, beginning to end.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we first think about
the physical body, your body,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
point A in terms of
your health represents

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
an absence of health.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It represents
things being wrong.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
This is where you have diseases,
aches and pains, coughs,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
hernias, flu, arthritis, cancer,
heart disease, high blood

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
pressure, whatever it is that
might be currently wracking

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Point A is symptoms up
until you get to point

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:90%
B, which is where you feel OK.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
This is where I feel fine.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
When someone says,
how do you feel,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:90%
you say, I feel all right.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is wrong.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:90%
This is an absence of symptoms.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And most of us, when we
think of our physical health,

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
we think of moving between
point A and point B.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Point C over here
represents super health.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
This is where you're feeling as
great as it's possible to feel.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the place
where your body, which

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is your temple that was granted
to you to house your soul,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
is treated with the
reverence that it

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:90%
deserves to be treated with.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
You are at perfect health.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So between point
B and point C is

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
where you feel OK to I
feel absolutely fantastic.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:90%
There are no toxins in my body.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no tobacco in my body.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:90%
There's no alcohol in my body.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:04.105 align:middle line:84%
There's an absence of
caffeines and things like that

00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that we know are just
destructive to our body.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This is where I take positive,
great care of myself.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's A, B,
and C. But I don't

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about that
tonight because it's

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:90%
depressing to most of you.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.305 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.305 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
All right, now let's take
your emotional health.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Point A over here represents
anxiety, stress, depression,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
fear, being upset,
feeling out of sorts,

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:90%
just being unhappy generally.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Point B represents
I have no symptoms.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not depressed.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing basically wrong.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
This is called ordinary
human awareness.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Point C represents,
again, I feel fantastic.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Depression isn't something that
is a part of my vocabulary.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
If someone says to me, don't
you ever get depressed,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:90%
as a woman once did.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.658 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:16.825 align:middle line:90%
She said, that's depressing.

00:15:16.825 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%
That's just depressing.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a place where you
are in love with life.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're not looking
at the negatives.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're not bonding yourself
to the wounds of your past.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You're not bonded
to those wounds.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
the emotional health.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want
to talk about that.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
What I want to talk about
is higher consciousness,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
highest levels of
consciousness, the place where

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
the most fully functioning
people among us live.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give this three
names as well for A, B,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and C. Point A represents
individual consciousness,

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
the ego.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the place
where I identify

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
who I am on the basis of
what I have, what I do,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and what other
people think of me.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
What I have, what I do, and
what other people think of me.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a place where
I basically see myself

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:90%
as separate from everyone else.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.013 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in competition with
all of those people that

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.353 align:middle line:84%
And in order for me to feel
really good about myself,

00:16:44.353 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I have to be better
than they are.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Point B represents
group consciousness.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Group consciousness
is one in which

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
my identification is with
the various groups that

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:90%
are a part of my life.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So here is like, I'm
not just ego involved,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
but I have an identification of
myself as, oh, I'm an American

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're a Canadian, or you're
a Mexican, or you're an Asian,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Here I am a male and
you are a female.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Here I am Catholic;
you are Protestant.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I am Muslim; you are something
that I despise called Jewish.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I identify
myself on the basis

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
of these tribes or these
groups that I belong to.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can take it from very
large groups to very, very

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
small groups, such as the
ones at the high school

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:90%
in Littleton.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
My identification is
as a member of this.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And very often, most of us
spend almost all of our life

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
either at point A or point B
or in combinations of this.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
That I am what I have, what I
do, what others think of me.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I am a member of
these various groups.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And on the basis of
these groups most

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
of the violence that takes place
in our society and our culture

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
is perpetrated.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
If you were born on
this side of the river

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was born on that
side of the river,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
then this means this is
where my loyalties lie

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:90%
and I have to be against you.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This is called
group consciousness.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very low, low
level of consciousness.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's one, unfortunately,
that most of the planet

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:90%
is still living on.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:90%
But we can change.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.868 align:middle line:84%
Over here is where I want
to spend most of tonight.

00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:90%
I'll put this right here.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
This is called
unity consciousness,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:90%
also called God consciousness.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It's called Christ
consciousness.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
In the East, it's called siddhi
consciousness, S-I-D-D-H-I,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:90%
siddhi consciousness.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness that is
represented by our ability

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transcend
our form, which

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is the definition of
the word transform.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Trans in front of form means to
go beyond form, to transform.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
When Lao Tzu was asked the
question, what is real,

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
master what is
real, he responded

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that is real which
never changes.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.913 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:10%
So now you've got to
find the part of you that

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:10%
meets that definition.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:10%
What part of you is
real and authentic

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:10%
that has never changed?

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it your body?

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Not mine.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I look in the mirror and I can't
even believe what looks back.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I just don't
think that's me.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.753 align:middle line:84%
That's just an old man
in there renting my face.

00:20:08.753 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Truly, that's how I see it.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to find
the part of you that

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is able to look at all
of that, to observe it.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember one morning
I was out running

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and my wife was
across the street.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.912 align:middle line:84%
And she just came
out about 6:00, 6:30.

00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said, come on, we're
going to have breakfast.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.412 align:middle line:84%
And then she was standing on
the other side of a fence.

00:20:34.412 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:90%
The fence was about this high.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I ran up to the fence
and I hurled over the fence.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.212 align:middle line:90%
I just jumped over the fence.

00:20:41.212 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And she screamed at me.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:90%
She said, you can't do that!

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, can't do what?

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:90%
She said, you're 56 years old.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't jump over fences
when you're 56 years old.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:90%
You could kill yourself.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh my god, I forgot.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And this observer in here,
this witness to this form--

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
which is the eternal
part of who we are--

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't ever age.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of you
that's been looking out

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:90%
that has never aged a bit.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:90%
How can it age?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It has no form.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It has no beginnings.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It has no ends.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
It has no boundaries.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It has no limits.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just that which is
beyond the world of form.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way I
know how to describe it.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you use
words, you're using symbols

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:90%
that have beginnings and ends.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.448 align:middle line:84%
And you can't define
it any longer.

00:21:34.448 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like trying to define God.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
You can only experience
God to know God.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that can
be described with words.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So this knowing,
this invisible part

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
of us in here that is
eternal, Carl Jung said--

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
the telling question
of a person's life

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
is their relationship
to the infinite.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's the most
important thing

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
that you can have in your life.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a relationship
with the infinite?

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that there's a
part of you that can never die?

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:10%
The people who live at
this level of consciousness

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:10%
that I'm calling
self-actualization, or higher

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:10%
awareness, or
higher consciousness

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:10%
have a different relationship
to the infinite than people

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:10%
who live over here
in the world of ego

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:10%
and in the world of the
group consciousness.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
These are people who
talk about the soul.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people
that I selected

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
for this Wisdom of the Ages
collection, Herman Melville.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:10%
I remember reading Moby Dick
when I was in high school

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:10%
and just being fascinated with
this obsession for this whale.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And Melville, I discovered
when I read about Melville,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:90%
went out--

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:84%
he was writing up
in Massachusetts.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.745 align:middle line:84%
And he went out
into a cornfield.

00:23:24.745 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And he sat in the
middle of a cornfield

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.805 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of July.

00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you know
what those are like?

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Where you can do nothing
but see corn all around you?

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
--so that he could get himself
into the feeling of what

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to describe.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he wrote.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was
one of the passages

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that I underlined when
I was in high school.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was, again, one that
I selected for this book

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
to write an essay about.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
He said-- for as this
appalling ocean surrounds

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
the verdant land, so
in the soul of man

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
there lies one insular
Tahiti full of peace and joy,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but encompassed by all of the
horrors of the half-lived life.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
When people say to me, what do
I do in moments of distress?

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
How can I overcome the
struggles and the difficulties

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:90%
in my life?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I say, go to Tahiti.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Go to that invisible
place within you,

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that place where you have
access to the divine peace.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.023 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have
to look at all

00:24:48.023 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of the things that have ever
happened to you in your past.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I have four words.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:90%
These are the four words.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.255 align:middle line:84%
These four words, if you
memorize these words--

00:25:04.255 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and you won't need
to write them down--

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
you will eliminate
virtually all turmoil

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your life
in all relationships,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's with your in-laws,
your husband, your wife,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
your ex-wife, your spouses,
your ex-in-laws, people

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
on the freeway, waiters,
baggage handlers,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
rude people on the street,
whatever it might be.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You get these four words
down, and you practice them

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.578 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But before I do, I think I
should take up a collection.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.184 align:middle line:84%
This is too good for what
you paid to get in here.

00:25:43.184 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're going to get
too much out of it, you know.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:90%
And here are the four words--

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
you're right about that.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.651 align:middle line:90%
Let me hear it.

00:25:58.651 --> 00:26:00.559 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right about that.

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really a very
weak, dumb audience.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.652 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.652 --> 00:26:07.388 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right about that.

00:26:07.388 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right about that.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, the idea here is
that it doesn't make me right.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It just allows me to
believe that I'm right.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's all the ego wants.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.930 align:middle line:90%
That's all the ego needs.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The ego just needs to
believe that it's right.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you can let any ego that
comes at you believe that it is

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:90%
right, your at turmoil is over.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.936 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I had
a talk about this.

00:26:38.936 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.413 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we've been
married a long time.

00:26:42.413 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're committed
to each other.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.788 align:middle line:90%
And we love each other.

00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
children together.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're pretty much in
this thing for the long haul.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, but sometimes even
though we love each other,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the way we talk to each other
doesn't sound like love.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You know after you've been
together for a long time?

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I know it's hard
for you to believe

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:90%
that this could come from me.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.815 align:middle line:90%
But it's not from me.

00:27:04.815 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It's always from her, all right?

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.847 align:middle line:84%
So we said to each other, what
can we do to eliminate this?

00:27:14.847 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we began to
practice this thing

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that I call being kind
rather than being right.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So which means that you allow
the sacred or the higher

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:84%
part of you to be more
dominant in your life.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And when someone says something
to you when you know obviously

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that they're wrong, instead
of making them wrong

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.097 align:middle line:84%
and creating the
turmoil, you just stop.

00:27:32.097 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And you say, now, is it my
ego that needs to make them--

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:90%
or is it the higher part of me?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And the higher part of me
just wants to be at peace.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:90%
You're right about that.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes you can just
hold up the four fingers.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Which is what we've
gotten into now.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.535 align:middle line:84%
When she'll say
something to me--

00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:50.975 align:middle line:84%
you see, my wife is still
wrong almost all the time.

00:27:50.975 --> 00:27:53.115 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And she feels the same way.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.698 align:middle line:84%
If she were giving
this talk, she'd

00:27:55.698 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:84%
say the same thing,
that I believe

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:84%
that I'm right all the time
and I'm wrong, you see.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.068 align:middle line:84%
So now we just hold
up the four fingers.

00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But I have noticed that
I did this the other day.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:90%
She said something to me.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was about to--

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:90%
because she was obviously wrong.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:90%
But I was about to go like this.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.843 align:middle line:90%
And I just went like that.

00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I hate
it when you do that.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
you're right about that.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I notice now that she's
holding up four fingers,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.002 align:middle line:84%
but she's doing
it one at a time.

00:28:23.002 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like she's doing--

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But each time, I say,
you're right about.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So you start practicing this.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
You start letting
this ego of yours

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
be something that
no longer dominates.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, you
move into a higher level

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you're starting
to choose peace.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So now what you do is, you do
this in all areas of your life.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You move into the place
where you choose to be kind

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:90%
rather than to be right.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
In the last few
minutes that I have,

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I would like to share with you
how to get what you really,

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
really, really, really want.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I did a TV special on this.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have seen it
on Channel 6 here in Denver.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Channel 6, did I say?

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It's getting late.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.789 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon I'll be calling
it your erogenous zones.

00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:90%
So here's the secret.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
This is what I have come
to tell you in Denver.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
What you really,
really, really, really--

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that's four reallys--
want, you will get.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And the four reallys
stand for something,

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:84%
how you attract
and manifest what

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
you want in your life,
individually and collectively

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:90%
as a people.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The first really stands
for what you wish for.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had more money.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had a
better relationship.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could get
that promotion.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could heal myself
of this hernia that I've got.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it
starts with a wish.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The second really stands
for what you ask for.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:10%
Ask and you shall receive.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:90%
We don't ask enough.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't surrender the
little mind to the big mind.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
When I get to a point in
my life where I'm stuck,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
if I'm writing, if I've got
something going on with one

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
of my children-- whatever it
might be and I get stuck--

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll get up from
my writing table.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I will go over to a chair,
usually a meditation chair.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll get very quiet.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And I will ask out
loud, I am stuck.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to write this
the way that it satisfies me.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I would really appreciate any
help that I might get from.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:54.142 align:middle line:84%
You and I put that
out there in words.

00:30:54.142 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And often, the
telephone will ring.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Wisdom
of the Ages, I

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
tell the story of when
I was away writing

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:90%
those was essays each day.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And only two people knew
my phone number, my wife

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.512 align:middle line:84%
and Deepak Chopra,
my other wife.

00:31:06.512 --> 00:31:09.822 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.822 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And we were planning a
trip or whatever it was.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And he called me, and right
in the middle of a moment

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:84%
when I was stuck, right
after I had said that.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.542 align:middle line:90%
And I told him the whole story.

00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd said
something to me.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.028 align:middle line:90%
And I went back.

00:31:19.028 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the
whole thing out there

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.650 align:middle line:90%
exactly how it had happened.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, go
ahead, include it.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, he said, I got
your message in the field.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And he picked up the phone and
felt that he needed to call me.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Ask.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, when you ask,
the most astonishing things

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:90%
begin to happen.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
You begin to manage the
coincidences of your life.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Things begin to
show up in your life

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't even know
were possible before.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Your attention is on it,
and you're manifesting.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
You're living over here.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you do live
at this point C,

00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
at this collective unity
siddhi god consciousness level,

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the coincidences of your
life begin to be managed.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to say, if
I keep my attention on it

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:90%
with passion, I will create it.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you're thinking
about something.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.717 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking not too
long ago about my wife had said,

00:32:15.717 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we've got the screen
door that the dog

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.257 align:middle line:90%
has knocked in about 100 times.

00:32:19.257 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've got get
this thing repaired.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.668 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps wanting
me to repair it.

00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I keep telling her, honey,
you're right about that.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But I ain't fixing the damn
screen door because I don't--

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking about that.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm driving
down I-95 on my way

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to playing a tennis
match in the morning.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And driving right alongside
me is this van that says,

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:90%
we will fix your screen door.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.627 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:39.627 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Right while I was
thinking about that.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.460 align:middle line:90%
I went, wow, this is fantastic.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And he got way ahead of me.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.758 align:middle line:84%
He was in the lane that I
couldn't get in or whatever.

00:32:47.758 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
I've got to find him.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a
phone number on there.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.902 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I get
up there, and he was

00:32:52.902 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:90%
stalled behind somebody else.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I started writing
the number down.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And this guy came out that
day and fixed my screen door.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I had had my attention on it.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And you think, oh, that's
just a coincidence.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:84%
After a while, these
coincidence begin

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to happen with more
and more regularity.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The third really stands for what
you intend, what you intend.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.650 align:middle line:90%
I intend to create this.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Not I hope it will happen,
but I intend to create it.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You shift from the language
of "maybe" and "can I" to "I

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:90%
will."

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, when you are
intending to manifest or create

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.930 align:middle line:10%
anything through Japa, don't
share it with anyone, not even

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:10%
your soul mate.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Because when you share
what you are attempting

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:10%
to manifest into
your life, you will

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.620 align:middle line:10%
have to explain it
or defend it, which

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:10%
means you instantly invoke ego.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
you invoke ego,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you stop the
process of creation.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
That which is seen hath not come
from that which doth appear.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Particles themselves
are not responsible

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:90%
for their own creation.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a summary
of quantum physics.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:90%
It takes something else.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get out
of the world of ego

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.699 align:middle line:90%
and into the world of spirit.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And by sharing it,
and defending it,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:84%
and explaining it, and talking
about it, you stop the process.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.361 align:middle line:90%
Just a little advice.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.349 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The fourth really
stands for passion,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:90%
what you are passionate about.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Passion means-- Nisargadatta
put it to me this way.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
He said, the attempt
to invoke and manifest

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:84%
what you want in your
life without passion

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
is like dressing up a corpse.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, it looks the part, and
it's got all the right clothes.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:10%
But it's still dead inside.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, manifesting
is not possible.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You must have passion, a
sense of identification

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
with what it is that
you want to create

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%
for yourself and your life.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's the good news.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is that
what you really,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
really, really, really, really
don't want you will also get.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is why most people
are not good at manifesting.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I want to
leave you ringing in your ears.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.700 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that what you
think about is what expands,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:90%
as you think, so shall you be.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
The ancestor to every
action is a thought.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And if your thoughts are
on what you don't want,

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.558 align:middle line:84%
then what you don't want is
what you will have to act upon.

00:35:37.558 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And what you don't want
will continue to manifest

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:90%
and show up into your life.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest prosperity
from "I despise being poor."

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest thin
from "I hate being fat."

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
If you hate being poor,
then hating being poor

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:90%
is where your attention is.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you will act
upon what you hate.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And you will see more evidence
for hating being poor show up

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in your life, and it gets worse.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest what
you want into your life

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.220 align:middle line:84%
if your energy or your attention
is on what is, that is,

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
on the circumstances
of your life.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:24.560 align:middle line:84%
If you put your attention
on what is, then what is

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:90%
is what you will act upon.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And you will see more
of what is continuing

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.528 align:middle line:90%
to show up into your life.

00:36:30.528 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
and lots of people

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:90%
out there to point out what is.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the way things are.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.380 align:middle line:90%
This is your reality.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:84%
You have always been
poor, except if you're

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.110 align:middle line:90%
one of those people.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:90%
You have always been fat.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stay fat.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You cannot-- and they will tell
you all the things that you

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.190 align:middle line:90%
cannot do.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And you might despise them
for doing that and saying that

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And your energy is on despising
what they tell you what is.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And you act upon
what you think about.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And more evidence to despise
what is keeps showing up.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Manifesters never
place their attention

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
on what is, only on what
they would like to create.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a simple
example of that.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I was in a hotel in
Chicago just two days ago.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was at 1:32
in the afternoon.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And I called down
to get a sandwich.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And room service closed at 1:30.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And the woman that answered
the phone said, I'm sorry,

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
we cannot make you
a sandwich, I said,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
it's only been two minutes.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Surely some kind-- I haven't
eaten since for four days.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I said-- I was giving
this long thing.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Surely there's got to
be something down there.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You can find some mouse
turds or something.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Put them on a piece of toast
and just make something, I said.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm sorry, sir,
room service is closed.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:90%
We cannot make you anything.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything is closed.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.032 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you know,
you're right about that.

00:38:01.032 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And I hung up the phone.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
call the manager.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to complain
about not getting any food.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized my thoughts
were on not getting a sandwich

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
and being upset.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So I slipped on some clothes.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And I got on the elevator.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the entire time
on the elevator I

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about what I
wanted, which was a sandwich.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I just want a sandwich.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I see myself having a sandwich.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not pissed off at this
lady who is where she is.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not upset about
the management.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I love the hotel.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem
with any of it.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.758 align:middle line:90%
I just want a sandwich.

00:38:36.758 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept seeing
myself having a sandwich.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I got off the elevator,
and I walked over

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to this little
area in this hotel.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was a guy
standing back there,

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
a Puerto Rican fellow, who was
sweeping up and everything.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd really
like to have a sandwich.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'll make
you a sandwich.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll make you a club
sandwich, no problem.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
What do you want on
your club sandwich?

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.945 align:middle line:84%
And he made this
beautiful sandwich.

00:38:59.945 --> 00:39:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
to pay for it.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's OK, don't worry.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to pay for it.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And I walked upstairs.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
there thinking,

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I had my attention
on what I wanted.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:84%
As long as my attention
was on what I didn't want,

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.230 align:middle line:84%
what I didn't want was
just what kept coming up.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.400 align:middle line:90%
It's an instant shift.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a simple little example
but something to keep in mind.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:90%
It gets worse.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest and attract
into your life what you want

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:84%
if your energy or your thoughts
are on what always has been.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if your thoughts
are on what always has been,

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.540 align:middle line:84%
you will act upon
what always has been.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And what always has
been will continue

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:90%
to show up into your life.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is no shortage
of people to tell you

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:84%
what always has been, the
way we've always done things.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And it gets even
worse than that.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.920 align:middle line:84%
You cannot manifest or attract
into your life what you want

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
if your thoughts or your energy
is on what they want for you.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Even if you despise what they
want for you and you hate

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
it and you resent them deeply
for imposing it on you,

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
you've got to say,
you're right about that,

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and get your attention
onto what you want.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Get your ego out of it.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Which means you let their ego
believe that they're right.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And get your energy
shifted onto what you want.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You see, you can be filled
with resentment and anger

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.310 align:middle line:90%
towards all of these people.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what you
will continue to act upon.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like if I gave
you a million dollars

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and I said to you, with
this million dollars,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.325 align:middle line:84%
go out to the mall and buy
anything that you want.

00:40:43.325 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's for.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the currency
that you have.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the first store you walk
into sells oriental rugs.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're $50,000 apiece.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.688 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I got a million
dollars to buy what I want.

00:40:52.688 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the ugliest looking
thing I've ever seen.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I would never want
that thing in my house.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's hideous looking.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Here's $50,000.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Send it home.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Next store you go to, they
have lamps that match the rug.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You look at these lamps.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.870 align:middle line:90%
They're $10,000 apiece.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:11.442 align:middle line:84%
You say, 20,000-- they want
$10,000 apiece for these lamps,

00:41:11.442 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and they're so hideous.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I would never want
those in my house.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Here's 20,000.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Send it home.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.275 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got
a million dollars

00:41:17.275 --> 00:41:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to spend as currency
on what you do want,

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:84%
but every time you
come into a store that

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.677 align:middle line:84%
sells what you don't
want, you spend the money

00:41:22.677 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that you have for what you do
want on what you don't want.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you get home
and you say, why

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is my house filled with all of
this stuff that I don't want?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.452 align:middle line:90%
And the answer-- you're crazy.

00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:90%
You are insane.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.782 align:middle line:84%
You've got currency to
buy what you do want.

00:41:39.782 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And any time you see
what you don't want,

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:84%
you spend it on
what you don't want.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.375 align:middle line:84%
Of course what you don't want is
going to show up in your life.

00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
happens, only the thoughts

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have are the
currency for manifesting

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.880 align:middle line:90%
what you want into your life.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:84%
If they're on what
you don't want,

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:90%
you will you surely create it.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're all in
relationships with people

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:90%
who are just like that.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're in
relationships with someone

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:90%
that's like that as well.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.273 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to remind them
is, they're right about that.

00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And get your thoughts and your
attention on what you want.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Do Japa, and ask for
whatever you want.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the essence of living at
higher levels of consciousness.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.725 align:middle line:84%
I want to close with
something that's

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:20.850 align:middle line:90%
going to ring in your ears.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It's written by a woman
named Oriah Mountain Dreamer.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:90%
She went to a party.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.343 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
lot of small talk.

00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
people who were talking

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.308 align:middle line:90%
about superficial things.

00:42:38.308 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
focusing on what they had

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.017 align:middle line:90%
and how much they had.

00:42:41.017 --> 00:42:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And she just couldn't
take it anymore.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
She's a single mom, two
children, Native American,

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.950 align:middle line:90%
lives up in Toronto.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
She went home and she took
out a pen and a pad of paper.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote out something
called The Invitation.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.035 align:middle line:84%
It's an invitation that
I'm going to give to you.

00:43:02.035 --> 00:43:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a book of hers that
will be out very soon called

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:90%
The Invitation.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.975 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe it
will be out this month.

00:43:06.975 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
It's written by Oriah
Mountain Dreamer.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest me
what you do for a living.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
you ache for and if you

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
dare to dream of meeting
your heart's longing.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest
me how old you are.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you will risk
looking like a fool for love,

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.230 align:middle line:84%
for your dream, for the
adventure of being alive.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.313 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest me what
planets are squaring your moon.

00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if
you have touched

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the center of your own sorrow,
if you have been opened

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:84%
by life's betrayals, or have
become shriveled and closed

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:47.170 align:middle line:90%
from fear of further pain.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can sit
with pain, mine or your own,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
without moving to hide
it, or fade it, or fix it.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can be
with joy, mine or your own,

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
if you can dance with wildness
and let the ecstasy fill you

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your
fingers and toes

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:84%
without cautioning us to be
careful, to be realistic,

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and to remember the
limitations of being human.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest me if
the story you are telling me

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.097 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:44:17.097 --> 00:44:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you
can disappoint another

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to be true to
yourself, if you can

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:27.502 align:middle line:84%
bear the accusation of betrayal
and not betray your own soul.

00:44:27.502 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you
can see beauty even

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:84%
when it's not pretty
every day and if you

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:37.230 align:middle line:84%
can source your own
life from its presence.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can live
with failure, yours and mine,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and still stand on
the edge of the lake

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.912 align:middle line:84%
and shout to the
silver of the moon--

00:44:44.912 --> 00:44:47.485 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest me
to know where you live

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.760 align:middle line:90%
or how much money you have.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can
get up after a night of grief

00:44:54.910 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and despair, weary and
bruised to the bone,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and do what needs to be
done to feed the children.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest
me who you know

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.765 align:middle line:90%
or how you came to be here.

00:45:08.765 --> 00:45:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can
stand in the center of the fire

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:90%
with me and not shrink back.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interest me
where or what or with whom

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.180 align:middle line:90%
you have studied.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what sustains you
from the inside when all else

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.530 align:middle line:90%
falls away.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.868 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you can
be alone with yourself

00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and if you truly
like the company you

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.080 align:middle line:90%
keep in those empty moments.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if you
can source your life

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:46.640 align:middle line:84%
from your knowing inside, from
the heroic mission that you

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%
were placed on this Earth for.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And if your attention is on "I
can't do what I love and love

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.290 align:middle line:84%
what I do because" then
that's exactly what

00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:00.020 align:middle line:84%
you will continue to manifest
and attract into your life.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Shift it.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Shift to higher level
of consciousness.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.040 align:middle line:90%
That's Oriah's invitation.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because in every moment of your
life, you have this choice.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You can either be a host to
God or a hostage to your ego.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:84%
God bless you all, and
thank you for coming today.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.080 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
