00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello I'm Chantal Westerman.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
unique opportunities

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.360 align:middle line:84%
we have here at
Wisdom Television

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is a great access to
some of the most popular

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and widely read authors,
spiritual leaders, and speakers

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:90%
on the holistic circuit today.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We at Wisdom Television believe
that now more than ever,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:84%
people have begun personal
journeys, spiritual journeys.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to ask you to
join us for a brand new series

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
here on Wisdom, called
the "Wisdom Workshops,"

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to meet some
of the people who are leading

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:90%
us on those journeys.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I ask that you bring only
two things, an open mind

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.955 align:middle line:84%
and a willingness to look at a
different kind of television.

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:90%

>> Every one of
you in this room,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
you come here this weekend
to the Whole Life Expo,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
because there's a part of
you that wants to learn more

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and want to gain more wisdom,
and there's another part of you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:90%
that wants to heal.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:10%
I talk in my book
about the difference

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:10%
between our soul's perspective
and our physical perspective.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:10%
We do have-- we, us
conscious, our conscious minds

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:10%
our bodies--

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:10%
we do have a different
attitude about things

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:10%
that our soul does.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Our soul sees things from a
higher perspective, all right?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Our soul can actually
look at an experience

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I need
to go through this,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to give you
an example of something that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:90%
happened in my life.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But our soul can kind of step
back and be more objective

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and look at an experience,
and say, OK, I'm

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
going through this,
because of this.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But in the body,
our conscious minds,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
we have a tough time with that,
because we're so emotionally

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
involved in our lives.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're going
through a tough experience,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for us
to detach ourselves

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and look at it from
the highest perspective

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and say, what is the
wisdom in this experience?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
a lot of times, we

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
don't know what our
soul's plan is, OK?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be hard
for us to understand it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that can
be confusing for people.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
People want it a little
more clear than that.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.315 align:middle line:90%
But I'll give you an example.

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
When I was young,
I was 19 years old,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a sophomore in college,
I was engaged to a man.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We had a pretty
dysfunctional relationship,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
but I was raised in
an alcoholic family.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, I had a
lot of dysfunction in me.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of--

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of everything,
a lot of shame about things,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rage, a
lot of confusion,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:90%
very, very low self-worth.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.654 align:middle line:84%
And I attracted to me
people that kind of--

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
honestly, kind of supported the
way that I felt about myself.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, he looked
great on the outside.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.195 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, I'll just--

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll marry this man, and
we'll have lots of kids,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be a social worker,
and he'll be a lawyer,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and we'll live
happily ever after.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And the whole inside of
me was just like, oh God.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew, but I was pretending
not to know what I knew.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in
this relationship,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and I found out that I was
pregnant, 19 years old, not

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:90%
married.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, back then, in 1968,
that was not a cool thing

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to be pregnant and unmarried.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And my attitude at that time,
again, very low self-worth,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought, why is
God doing this to me?

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't God prevent this?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
If God really loved me, he
wouldn't have made me pregnant.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But I was raised a
Presbyterian, OK,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and I had the belief that if bad
things happened in your life,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:90%
it came from God.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to look at
my life, because here was

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:90%
this very painful situation.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my
boyfriend and realized--

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
it was just like the
whole experience just

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:90%
slapped me in the face.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my
God, I can't do this.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do this.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
As much as here I'm
engaged to this--

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
everybody thought he
was a wonderful guy.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, he had
a lot of promise.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Straight A's in college.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He was going to go
on to be an attorney.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.455 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
have this great life.

00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But everything just kind
of slapped me in the face,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.563 align:middle line:84%
and I went, whoa,
this is-- well,

00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say the
word dysfunction.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Back then, I didn't hear the
word dysfunction back then.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
But you just knew.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew inside,
this is not right.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I had been raised
by a mother who had taught

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%
me to listen to my inner voice.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And I went to my inner
voice and said what do I do?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And my inner voice said,
you have this baby,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and you place him for adoption.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my
boyfriend, this is

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
what I have to do as
painful as it was.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, throughout my pregnancy,
I felt really, really bad.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I felt like about this high.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
How could I do
this to my family?

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I felt awful about
doing this to my child,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
because my father
had been adopted,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and he had been adopted into a
very, very dysfunctional family

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of bad, bad stuff
had happened to my dad.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And so all throughout
the pregnancy,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I had this fear that this was
going to happen to my son.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:10%
And so it was a very hard time,
and yet, I mean, I look back,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:10%
and I think, so
much pain went on

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:10%
because of my low
self-worth, because

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:10%
of how I was looking
at the experience.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:10%
I placed my son for
adoption, and it

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:10%
continued for a long,
long, long, long time

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:10%
to be a very painful
experience inside.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went from thinking, why
did God do that to me to kind

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of the new age way of
thinking-- this was back

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s and '70s--

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
of I must have done
something terrible

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to another woman in a past life
to have to give up my child.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I must have taken a child
away from another woman

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I must have been
really, really bad person

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to have had to go
through that experience.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
As I continued to heal
myself, my perspective

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
of that whole
experience changed.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:10%
And that's a lot
of what we're doing

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:10%
is as we heal
ourselves, as we go

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:10%
through these
painful experiences,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:10%
and we heal ourselves,
our perspective changes.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And the more that
we heal ourselves,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:10%
then we start to see the
wisdom in the experience.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer, why
did God do this to me?

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer this happened
to me because I'm a bad person.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
this happened to me

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
because I was a terrible
person in a past life.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Seven years ago, my
inner voice told me

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that I could start
to look for my son.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had asked God ever
since my son turned 18,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I had asked him, can I
start looking for him?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And every time I meditated on
it, I'd hear not yet, not yet.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:10%
And I kept working
on myself, and I

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:10%
kept working on this path.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:90%
And I got to a place--

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 1992--

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
where some major healing
had taken place inside of me

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and some big chunks of
self-worth had healed.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And one morning, I woke
up, and a voice said,

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.655 align:middle line:90%
you can look for your son now.

00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You can start to look
for your son now.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of the pieces
fell into place for me.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And I met my son.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have developed, like, a
totally cool, totally wonderful

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:90%
mother-son relationship.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, my perspective
is completely different.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:10%
It's no longer--
none of that happened

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:10%
because I was a bad person or
because God was punishing me

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:10%
for having premarital
sex or because I was

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:10%
a bad person in a past life.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It happened because it happened.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It happened because I gained
so much from the experience.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I came into this lifetime
to do the work that I'm

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
talking to you about today to
get to develop my abilities,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:90%
to do the work that I've done.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
My work-- I never had any
other children after that.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
My work has been my
life, and I really

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
believe that that's what's
been important to my soul is

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to come in and do the
work that I've done,

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.813 align:middle line:84%
develop my abilities,
heal myself.

00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
I'm not there yet.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Still got a ways to go.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
This whole self-worth thing, boy
I tell you, it's a tough one.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I came in to do the
work that I'm doing.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But my soul also
wanted to be a mother.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And my son grew up in a
wonderful family who loves him.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
They're very grateful for him.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
He turned out to be a totally
wonderful human being.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think back on what
it would have been like

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
if I would have raised
him, and I don't think

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.425 align:middle line:90%
it would have been so good.

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I love him,
but I would have been

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:90%
an extremely overprotective.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.813 align:middle line:84%
I've told him many times, I
would have put you in a room

00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and kept you in there until you
were 20 and let you out maybe.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I was so--

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't I wouldn't have
wanted anything in life

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to touch him or hurt him
or give him any pain.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:90%
I would have been obsessive.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I had so much dysfunction
in me that had to heal.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I see the
reason for that now.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it while
I was in the pain,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
but as I've healed from
the pain, I can look back,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and I can see it now.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I mean when
I say that as we heal,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
our perspective
changes, and we start

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to see these experiences that
we've come in here to have.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:10%
We see them differently.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't see them through
the eyes of low self-worth.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't go through the
pain, thinking I deserve this

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a bad person.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Every one of you in this
room, you come here this week

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
into the Whole Life
Expo, because there's

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
a part of you that
wants to learn more,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
you want to gain more wisdom.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's another part
of you that wants to heal.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on this planet is
here to heal, all of us.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a few angels
walking around on Earth.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I guess, they're already there.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But most of us, all of us,
that's what we come here to do.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.278 align:middle line:10%

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:10%
One of the angels
said to me recently--

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:10%
I heard someone in
a talk said, so how

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:10%
do we know we came
here to do it,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:10%
how do I know, and
the angel said,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:10%
you have to tell them that
whatever it is they're

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:10%
avoiding--

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a good clue right there.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
All those things you're kind
of putting off till later, you

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
know, I'll get to that later.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was in
psychic development classes.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was a practicing
alcoholic at the time.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was unbelievable.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.253 align:middle line:84%
I mean, get drunk
and see dead spirits,

00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
walking around all the time.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:90%
It was like-- it was insanity.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:90%
But OK, it was the way I did it.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember many, many times
sitting on a bar stool downtown

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
at Uncle Sam's, and my spirit
guide's coming up to me

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you've got
to stop this nonsense

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and get on your path.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.425 align:middle line:90%
Oh, please, leave me alone.

00:13:23.425 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get on your path.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.427 align:middle line:90%
You got to get on your path.

00:13:27.427 --> 00:13:28.227 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:28.227 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:10%
They'd say that to me,
I swear, 24 hours a day.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get on your path.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get on your path.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Deal with your alcoholism.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Get on your path.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'd be like, would
you guys just leave me alone?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
No, we're not going
to leave you alone.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You have things that
you came here to do.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, deal with your alcoholism.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Get on your path.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I used to say to
them, I'm only 24.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Get off my back.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.163 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of partying to do.

00:13:53.163 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Why did you come
back when I'm 40?

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
When I'm old.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're 24,
you think 40's old, right?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was my attitude,
come back when I'm older.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll-- and
then I'll quit drinking,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
because I'll be ready then.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll get on my path.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.247 align:middle line:84%
And they would not leave
me alone, thank God,

00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because they're the ones that
just about drove me insane

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and finally got into
recovery and got on my path.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
thing I was avoiding.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.305 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was like every
time, I'd take a drink,

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'd think I know--

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I don't
know how they knew,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
but every time I'd
head for the bar,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:90%
they'd head down there, too.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go to take that drink,
and there they'd be, you know?

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
You're like, oh God.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
always this struggle.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought it was
them that I was struggling with.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:90%
But it was inside of me.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I knew-- you know, I could
look back now and see

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that I chose to come
into an alcoholic family

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
because I had been
alcoholic before,

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and I had never dealt with it.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I just kept dying a drunk.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:84%
It was time to come in and deal
with it and get on your path.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I came in to do.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I chose the
perfect family system

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
to do that in, except
growing up in it,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
again, I thought, why
is God doing this to me?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, they say Jesus
loves you, God loves you.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, hey, what about me?

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I always saw it
as God didn't love me.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:90%
God wasn't protecting me.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:90%
And why me?

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time, my life
was about why me, why me,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
why me until things
started to change.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, as we heal,
our perspective changes.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to see all the
really cool stuff about life.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love-- today, I love
the family that I grew up in.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't have said
that for a long time.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I used to think poor
me all the time.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Grew up with two
alcoholic parents.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
I was a very sad person.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I was a very rageful person.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
lot of pain to heal,

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
but I know now that when I
was born into that family,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I already had that
rage inside me.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I already had that pain
there, and my family just

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
helped to bring it up
to the surface, you see?

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you could look
into your family systems,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
look into your life, look at
the painful situations that

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
are going on in your life,
and just say, OK, now,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%
what is the wisdom in this?

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Why would the elders
or why would I

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to have this
situation go on in my life?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, after we'd
been here, and we've

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
healed as much as we can,
as much as our souls can,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.965 align:middle line:84%
we lay the body down, and we
go back home, and we rest.

00:16:56.965 --> 00:16:57.765 align:middle line:90%
We take a break.

00:16:57.765 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:10%
We take a long break.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:90%
We take a short break.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They say usually between 60 and
100 years between lifetimes.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people come back
quicker, but that's not

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
advised, because it can
be kind of confusing.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
Still have the identity
of the last person.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
So we come in.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we go back, and
we stay on the other side.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And after we're
home for a while,

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
our heads have kind
of cleared out.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Then we do a life review.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And the life review
takes place over

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
a long, long, long,
long period of time.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
It isn't like something
you go and do in a week.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, it has to do with
your perspective, how

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:90%
you see things.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:10%
And you record it all in your
case your Akashic records,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:10%
and then you just take a
break, and you hang out

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:10%
with all those other souls
that on the other side,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.842 align:middle line:10%
because when we
go home, we see--

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, think about it.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.175 align:middle line:10%
Just think about
it for a second.

00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's say all of us in this
room have had 300 lifetimes, OK?

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Buddha said that
it took 550 lives

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:90%
before he became the Buddha.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's just say that
all of us have had 300 lives.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the
souls that you know.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So when we go home,
it's like a big reunion.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, hey, I'm
back from school.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Man, you should hear
the things I learned.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah?

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And we share it with them.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:90%
And we run into old friends.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the
coolest thing to go back home.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Death is, unfortunately,
portrayed to us-- well,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of course, to us, it's
our physical body.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
want to think about it.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Like the guide said, when
God created our bodies,

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
he created our bodies with a
very strong desire to survive.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to
hear about death.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you,
I can guarantee you

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that when it is time for you
to lay down that body and go,

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
death is probably going to be
the easiest thing you will ever

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
do, because it's simply--

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
it's like taking off a sweater.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You just step out of your
body, and you go on home,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.085 align:middle line:84%
and you see all
kinds of friends.

00:19:04.085 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to here a
cool little baby story?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.543 align:middle line:10%
I just learned this
one the other day.

00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:10%
So I want to tell
everybody the story.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:10%
I have a girlfriend
who's pregnant.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, she just had her baby,
but girlfriend who's pregnant,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and about a month ago, I
wanted to make the baby

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.732 align:middle line:84%
a blanket, and so I wasn't
sure about the timing.

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody said-- she had
like three different doctors

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and three different due dates.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I just said I'd like to
talk to the soul of the baby.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that soul
came into my house.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%
She just came in, totally cool.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, when are
you going to be born?

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to
make this blanket,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and I just need to know
if I have enough time.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, don't worry.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I have to be on the other
side until at least August 30.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I have to be there August 30.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to be there.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.395 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:20:02.395 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you're not coming
until after the 30th of August.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:84%
She says, then after
that, you know,

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.192 align:middle line:90%
I can come any time after that.

00:20:09.192 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I have-- OK.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:90%
All right, thanks.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Gives me plenty of time.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So I got the blanket done,
and August 30, my friend

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.857 align:middle line:90%
started having contractions.

00:20:19.857 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was over channeling the
healing to her because she

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:90%
had a sinus infection.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was really cool.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Into the room-- oh, I
had asked her that day.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
What's the big deal
about August 30?

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.352 align:middle line:84%
She just looked at me like,
it's none of your business.

00:20:31.352 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:90%
And she had left.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that on August 30, I'm
channeling a healing to her,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and a beautiful angel came
into the room, and said,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
hello, my name is
Gloria, and I'm

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
going to be your
daughter's guardian angel.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:90%
That's totally cool.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
So I told my friend that.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I said, where is--

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:90%
where is the soul?

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, today's August
30, and I know something

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:90%
was real important for her.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the angel said to
me, today, a friend

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
of hers who is living
in Pakistan is dying,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to be coming
over to the other side,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and this soul is the first
soul that this woman is going

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to look for, because she
was her granddaughter

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.335 align:middle line:84%
in this last life, and
she died when she was six.

00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, she's going
to be there to greet her

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
when she comes over, and
they will have a reunion,

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and she said it may
take days, and she said,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and when she feels ready
to let her grandmother be

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
then she will come in.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a cool story?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, you know--
and you think about--

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
you think about all
the goofy things

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
we do to get somebody
into labor, you know?

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:03.528 align:middle line:84%
Vacuuming, eating Chinese food,
making love, not making love,

00:22:03.528 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
running up and down the stairs.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.153 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you do all these things.

00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I remember somebody
when I was pregnant,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I was six weeks overdue.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And they used to
say to me, drive her

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
down some bumpy roads.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we do all
these things, right?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But when the soul is
ready, the soul comes in.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the soul
when they come in,

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
they come in right
after the baby is born,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
or if the mother-- if the
baby's body is kind of stuck.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the soul will
actually go in

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
just before birth to help
its little body come out.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But usually, it is
an adult soul that

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.975 align:middle line:84%
is going to be born into
a little baby's body.

00:22:48.975 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
They're coming back in to
have a brand new experience.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:10%
Two things that are very helpful
for us living on this planet.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've heard
these both before,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:10%
but I just want to kind
of drill it in there

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:10%
just a little bit deeper.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is one thing, one
tool that is really important

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
is to listen to
this voice inside.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us, again,
when the guides showed me

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
our souls, when our souls
were created, they showed me,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, each one of us is a soul,
and our soul oftentimes looks,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:90%
appears like in body form.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Although they can
be streaks of light.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed when you
take a picture of somebody,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and you get it back, and
there's all kinds of streaks.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's streaks of
light in pictures--

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
even the movie,
"The Sixth Sense,"

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
you may have seen that,
when the mother is looking

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
at the picture of
the little boy,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
there's always this
little squiggle line.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
That's probably a
soul, all right?

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.135 align:middle line:84%
Again, souls are energy,
and they can look any way

00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:05.935 align:middle line:90%
that they want.

00:24:05.935 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But usually, when we see
them, when I see them,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
they are in a form.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm always
aware of is I see,

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I can see inside of our souls
this little light in here.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Looks like our pilot
light actually,

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:90%
but it never goes out.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And within that light is
a voice, and most of us

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:90%
refer to that as our intuition.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the inner voice.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's referred to in the Bible as
the still, small voice within.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.855 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can see it.

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can see it.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
When I see a soul, I can see
that little light inside.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, with
some people, the light

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
is much bigger and brighter.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:90%
So it changes.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
As a person grows
spiritually, that light,

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
the connection that they feel
to their source gets bigger.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've even-- sometimes
when I'm doing a meditation,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and I go in, and I'll focus
on that voice, the light,

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the light will just
grow really, really big

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:90%
and just completely surround me.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my minister said
one time, just sit and practice

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:90%
sitting in the presence of God.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't know
what that meant at first.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But then, what I
did was I went in,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.408 align:middle line:84%
and I looked inside
that light, and then

00:25:27.408 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:90%
the light just grew really big.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.283 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, that's
what that means,

00:25:30.283 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
just sitting in the
presence of this energy

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and feeling that calmness.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, inside that energy is
really and truly a voice,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's-- you know, a lot
of us think of it as my gut

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%
instinct.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I just have a feeling.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I have a knowing.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's this voice in here.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you need any kind
of guidance in your life,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
you just ask the
universe for help.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:10%
And instead of
going to your head,

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:10%
try going down here, all
right, and listening.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm lucky
because I was raised

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
by a mom, who always taught me,
well, what does it say inside?

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from mom, what
should I wear on this date?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does it
say on the inside?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like, Mom, can't you
just answer the question?

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:90%
No, honey.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:90%
You have to learn this.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
really good for me.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And it'll help you
with everything,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
from what should you wear to
when to apply for a job to--

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
oh gosh, everything,
what bank to go to,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
what house to buy, when to
buy, when not to buy, oh gosh,

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I use this voice
inside continually

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:90%
for any kind of guidance.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And what's cool about it
is it never lies to you.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It has no intention
of lying to you.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
This voice inside,
like the guide

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
said, that we have to get
away from this thinking

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that all the pain in our
life was created by God

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:90%
or given to us by God.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We got to wipe that
kind of thinking out.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It isn't God that has created
these painful experiences

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It's God that wants to help
us through each experience.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of these experiences
we've asked for and that God

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:10%
respects our intelligence
enough, so that he doesn't

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:10%
come-- he/she doesn't
come flying in and say,

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.510 align:middle line:10%
you know what, you're too
stupid to have that experience.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't have that
experience, or you

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
haven't gained enough wisdom.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
God honors the choices that
we've made, doesn't take them

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
away and knows that
that's how we learn

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the best is by going through
the experiences that we have,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
but that this source
that created us,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
has said to us
continually, I'll help

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:90%
you get through these things.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Just ask me for some help.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.538 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:28:10.538 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Think about those times in
your life when you say, don't.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this myself.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:10%
And then you get
to the place where

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:10%
you start asking for help, OK?

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:10%
Again, there's all
these little things.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:10%
We come from one attitude,
and we're continually

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:10%
changing our attitudes and
growing and healing, OK?

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can reach out, and
you can ask the source inside,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:90%
help me, please.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Give me some solutions here.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Help me know what I need to
do to heal this relationship.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Help me know what to
do about my career.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Lead me to the right person to
help me heal this inner pain.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:90%
You can always ask for that.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.065 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
need to stay open.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You need to stay
out of your head

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.028 align:middle line:84%
and stay open to whatever
guidance will come to you,

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:84%
because I guarantee, you,
you will always get guidance.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not that same day.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the voice inside will
say, just wait a little bit.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, timing is a really,
really important thing,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
which leads me to the
next important tool.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
This one's a
discipline for sure.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.995 align:middle line:84%
What it is is
living a day a time.

00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think about the
obituary just for a second,

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.378 align:middle line:84%
if any of you
looked at it today.

00:29:28.378 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:10%
How many people on
there do you think

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.295 align:middle line:10%
knew at the
beginning of the week

00:29:31.295 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:10%
that they would be in there
by the end of the week?

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
It's tough to say, isn't it?

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't
think about dying.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think it's
going to happen way

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
down there somewhere.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as you know,
death occurs all the time.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.272 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense to us
logically when someone dies.

00:29:54.272 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
How many times do
you hear somebody

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:84%
say, gosh, you know, they
had everything going,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:90%
why would they die now?

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, why did God
do this to them now?

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.360 align:middle line:90%
The soul leaves when it's done.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to do is really,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
really, really
discipline ourselves

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
to just focus on today.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
There are so many people
on our planet right now

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed in hospitals
because they're

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed, taking
a lot of drugs

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:90%
because they're overwhelmed.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know all
about overwhelmed.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I used to-- as I've told you.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:10%
I drank a lot, and I
took a lot of Valium,

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:10%
because I was
always overwhelmed.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn how
to live a day at a time.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn how
to live a day that time,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
life isn't so scary.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not so
overwhelming when you

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
don't have to figure
out all of that today.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:10%
If you can really get
in to today Sunday,

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:10%
September 12th, I'm
sitting in this room,

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:10%
and then when you get
up and leave the room,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:10%
then you go and decide.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:10%
It's like if you can really take
it, a moment at a time, life

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:10%
is not going to be as
overwhelming as it's gotten,

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are totally
stressed to the max

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:84%
right now, because there's
so much on our plate.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:90%
But we can do it.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:90%
We can live here.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We just have to slow our
brains down a little bit.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to take
care of Monday on Sunday.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.198 align:middle line:90%
You just have to live on Sunday.

00:31:30.198 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can deal with
Monday when it gets here.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can take notes.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, what I do at the end
of the day, as I sit on my bed

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and just say, God,
is there anything

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:90%
I need to know for tomorrow?

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll write a little
list, and I'll let it go.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Today is all that we have.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:10%
And if we can just
really know that,

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:10%
because that is the truth.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That really is the truth.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has guaranteed
any of us in here

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:90%
we're going be here tomorrow.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you can really, really
know that, I know a lot of you

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:90%
say, yeah, but.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But there isn't
a yeah, but here.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
the way to make it

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the
day, no guarantees.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we really could
get that, that this is all

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I have to live with.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:84%
This is all I have to
deal with is today, wow.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Life seems a lot easier.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not so overwhelming.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.957 align:middle line:90%
We can find solutions.

00:32:25.957 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're here
to do this lifetime.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:10%
You're here to find solutions
for the pain that's inside.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:10%
And again, if you want a clue
as to what you came here to do,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:10%
just look in your
life with the things

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:10%
you're trying not to see, OK?

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:10%
Look at the things
in your life that you

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:10%
don't want to deal with, that
you're putting off till later,

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:10%
and start dealing
with them now, today.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Take it a chunk at a time,
and it really won't be so bad,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:84%
When we can do it that way, when
we can live by our intuition,

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:06.250 align:middle line:84%
get the guidance that we need,
when we can focus on today,

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
then this journey here on
Earth really isn't that tough.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it's OK to
go after those things

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.090 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want to look
at, because then we start

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:90%
to heal from those things.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we actually start
to like our life, you know?

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Life is not such a
struggle, and it all

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:90%
starts to fall into place.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Really works out well.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to do a little
meditation, just to help

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.468 align:middle line:90%
you all relax a little bit.

00:33:40.468 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:84%

I want you to take
a nice deep breath.

00:33:54.764 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Just blow it out.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Take one more.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Bring it way deep from
your tummy all the way up,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.600 align:middle line:90%
and just release it.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.653 align:middle line:84%
You've probably lots of
thoughts going on right now,

don't want to deal with.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So just let that
all go right now.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:10%
Take another nice deep breath.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Move your neck a little bit.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
Move your head

and they're standing.

There's an angel standing

they stand behind you,

hands on your shoulders.

of your very creative tools.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And the heat begins to
move down your body.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The heat spreads all throughout
your arms, your chest,

colon, your hips, your thighs,

down your knees, your
legs, down your feet.

placing one of their hands

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to breathe
in healing energy.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.565 align:middle line:84%
Let it go into your heart to
heal some of the old wounds.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to see the
healing energy going deeper

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
inside, not just to
your physical body,

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:90%
but deep inside your soul.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Your angel stands there,
one hand on your shoulder,

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:84%
one hand on your heart, and the
heat and the love from there

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:84%
hand goes deeper and
deeper inside your heart

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to heal some very old, old
wounds from past lives,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to heal some of
that homesickness

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that we all have
for the other side,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:84%
to heal some of the
cracks and the breaks

that you've had over a
lifetimes around love.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Just let the healing go deep
inside that heart of yours.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And if tears come up, that's OK.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't push them down.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Tears come up to cleanse us.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.730 align:middle line:84%
If there is an issue
in your life right

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:09.476 align:middle line:84%
now, or a question
that you have,

00:40:09.476 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:84%

it to the angel.

to them, and then I

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:84%
want you to just sink even
deeper into your chair,

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:84%
taking another deep
breath and just

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.085 align:middle line:84%
letting yourself
completely relax.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%

you know you deserve anything

that you want.

pain, so that we no longer

limit ourselves by our
beliefs, by our fears,

by our shame, our
guilt, our rage.

to do right now

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
is think of those things
over the last few days

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.254 align:middle line:84%
that have been bothering
you on your mind.

00:42:18.254 --> 00:42:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pretend
they're all in your pocket,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to visualize
taking them out of your pocket

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.155 align:middle line:84%
and handing them to
your angel right now.

00:42:29.155 --> 00:42:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Angels have big hands.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They've got their hand
open to you right now,

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:84%
so you go ahead and
put everything in there

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that you're tired
of dealing with,

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:84%
tired of trying to
find a solution to,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
all those things
that you feel you

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.970 align:middle line:90%
have to find a solution for.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:55.958 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:42:55.958 --> 00:43:04.356 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.356 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And now the angel
closes up their hands.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:14.091 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:84%
They smile, and they slowly move
back up, slowly moving back up,

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:32.371 align:middle line:84%
leaving the room, taking
your concerns with them.

00:43:32.371 --> 00:43:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to work with
you to find solutions.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Your job will be to stay
open to receiving them

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.186 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of weeks.

00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.621 align:middle line:84%
Once again, look at
that light inside.

00:43:58.621 --> 00:44:00.052 align:middle line:90%
It burns brightly.

00:44:00.052 --> 00:44:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of your body,
the weight of your body.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:90%
You just felt your soul.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very
light, gentle part of you.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.591 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're feeling
your body again,

00:44:26.591 --> 00:44:30.430 align:middle line:90%
the weight, the seriousness.

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling how your mind is
limited in how it sees things.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.066 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.066 --> 00:44:41.042 align:middle line:10%
But it's OK.

00:44:41.042 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We're limited in
how we see things

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:90%
because it helps us to cope.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:53.583 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.583 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:84%
You're right where
you need to be.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Ask the universe to keep working
with you to help you heal,

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to get there.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.110 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get to the
place where you love your life,

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:84%
you love who you are, you
feel proud of the person

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:90%
You're on your way there now.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:84%
You're doing what
you came here to do.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Just be gentle.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Just be patient with yourself.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what
your real history is.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Your soul came in with
a history to heal.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.775 align:middle line:90%
So be patient, and be loving.

00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And you'll get there.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Take one more deep breath
to connect with your body.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.312 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.312 --> 00:45:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to count to three,
and when I get to three,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.553 align:middle line:90%
you'll open your eyes.

00:45:53.553 --> 00:45:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And you'll stay
mellow, but you'll

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.830 align:middle line:90%
feel excited about being here.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:04.480 align:middle line:84%
One, becoming
aware of the people

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
around you now, other
bodies, feeling in the room.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Becoming more aware of
your body, your shoulders,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
your neck, the chair
you're sitting in.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Back in your body completely.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is clear.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Your body is clear.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And open your eyes
when you feel ready.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:52.830 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:90%
popular

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you all for coming.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I hope you have a great day, OK?

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
