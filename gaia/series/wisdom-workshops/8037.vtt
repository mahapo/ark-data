00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> People say, am
I against aging.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:84%
No, I want to be the youngest
98-year-old I can be.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
We should end the disability
that goes with aging.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to think of aging
as being in a nursing home

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:90%
or being infirm.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
If you care about
aging, you care

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:84%
about ending the disability
that goes with it.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
We all have more than one age.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:10%
We have a calendar age.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:10%
That's the number of
birthdays we've celebrated.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But we also have a real age,
the actual age of our body,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and that can be many years older
or younger than our calendar

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever stop to
think that if 70-year-olds

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
can win Ironman contests
and 44-year-olds drop

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
dead of a heart attack, that
measuring aging by the calendar

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
may not be the best way.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And what real age
is is a process

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that lets you measure
your rate of aging.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I've got a $50 bill.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have a $50 bill?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It's because this
is a system that,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
like money, values your choices,
so you can make choices.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
If I were to give
you this and say

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
you had to spend it
by tomorrow night,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.035 align:middle line:90%
what would you spend it on?

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably dinner,
I'm getting hungry.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Dinner, you're
getting hungry.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.652 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:42.255 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to go to
a cheap restaurant,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
because I'm interested in it,
too, so you've got to share.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.037 align:middle line:10%
What would you spend it on?

00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, probably food.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Food.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Vitamins.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Vitamins.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The good thing
about this is each

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
of you knew what $50 would buy,
food or dinner or vitamins.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
No one told me they
were going to buy a car.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
Because you knew $50
wasn't enough to buy a car.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And no one told me you were
going to buy a cup of coffee

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
because you knew you had too
much for a cup of coffee.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real power
and potential of money.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It lets you value
your choices, so you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
can make choices that
are rational for you.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
did with "Real Age."

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:10%
I worked with a
team of people who

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:10%
went through and evaluated
all the studies in the world's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:10%
literature.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:10%
We evaluated over 25,000
studies and came down

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:10%
with 126 factors that determine
your rate of aging in at least

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:10%
four studies in
humans, and that you

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:10%
can have some chance of
changing, 44 of which

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:10%
are relatively easy, and we'll
cover many of them today.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So what this is is a system that
lets you value your choices.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
In everything else in
life, you have numbers.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You have your income level
or your sales figures

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:90%
or your grade point average.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
In everything else
in life, we have

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
numbers that let us
value our choices

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and set goals, except for
the most important thing.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:90%
That's our health.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we've done
with "Real Age"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is we let you make choices
because we value everything.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I say that flossing
your teeth is worth 6.4 years

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to you, it means that if you
regularly floss your teeth,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
you can actually make
yourself younger by six years.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Say, wow, and
obviously I'm picking

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the most outlandish or
most outstanding one,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
but preventing periodontal
disease has an amazing effect.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Periodontal disease
is the leading cause

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or one of the leading causes
of your arteries getting old.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It also for the
younger women here,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
preventing periodontal
disease is the best prevention

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
we know of for preventing
miscarriages and preventing

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
premature labor.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it's one of the
things that is strongly

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
correlated with
that, so flossing

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
is even beneficial for you.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that gives you an idea
of the magnitude of things.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got this to remind me.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us knows we should
get our immunizations, right?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But that's only
a six-day effect,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
so this tells you the
value of certain things.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:10%
And if something
makes you older,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:10%
such as taking the
wrong vitamins,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:10%
buying the wrong ones,
buying ones with iron in them

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:10%
if you're a man or
buying ones with too

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:10%
much of certain things in
them, actually make you older.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Too much vitamin A, more than
8,000 international units

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:10%
a day, make you older, and
there's no reason to do that.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
That's been shown repeatedly
to make yourself older.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So what "Real Age" does is it
helps to end the confusion,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
so that it could
teach you and me--

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason I wrote
it was to share it with people--

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
how you can get younger,
and what actually

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on your health.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show some of
the science relating to this.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:90%
First is to tell us how we age.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think that if
you look at this scale,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that our quality of life
hits its peak some time,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that our quality of life hits
its peak sometime around age

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
28 for men, 36 for
women, and then it's

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
an all downhill
slope after that.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't how
it has to be, and let

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
me show you some of the data.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
This orange line is what
I want you to follow.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the IQ of physicians
at Harvard as they get older.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:90%
They didn't start at zero.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the change in IQ.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So they decline,
and they go down,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
in that the average
person goes down,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the average physician goes
down on that orange line.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:90%
That's 5% per decade.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What else declines like
an IQ at 5% per decade?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything else we have.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.675 align:middle line:90%
Our heart function does.

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Our liver function does.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Our lung function does.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Our bone mass does,
our muscle mass.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do
anything, the developed

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
nations of the world,
the average decline

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in every function we have
is the same as the IQ

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:90%
function, 5% per decade.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:84%
But I added a key phrase,
if we don't do anything.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
There's another key component,
and that's why it's in red.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It's even more key, and
that's the variability.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
The variability change
swamps the decline.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:10%
This is the real set of
curves of our quality of life.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:10%
There's a range, and
there's no reason

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:10%
you have to live on the
heavy dark one, which

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:10%
is the median or average.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:10%
You can live at the
top of your curve

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:10%
all your life till
right before the end.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what the data show.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You can do it, and it's
never too late to start.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier
than you think.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The data come from studies
that I'm going to show you.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And follow, and the way we're
able to give an age change

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
is data like this.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
This in science talk is called
a Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
This just shows the percent of
people alive at different ages.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And you see, if you're
a man and you're

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
on the average curve,
which is the blue curve,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
you're on average going
to die at age 76 or 77.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the current men's curve.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you're 59
and on that curve,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
your real age is 59 because
you're like the average person.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you're on
that maroon curve

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and are doing healthy things
and going to live longer,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:90%
you're really not 59.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:90%
You're 44.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you're on the gray curve
and doing unhealthy things,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:90%
you're really not 59.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:90%
You're 74.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was we took every
health effect, every health

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
category that we
could quantitate,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that had data like this, and
put it into an age framework.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The studies that we look
at come from two sources.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
One is called risk
factor epidemiology,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
and the other is called
randomized controlled trials.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you an example.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Risk factor
epidemiology is this.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:90%
They took 122,000 nurses.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Are any of you part of
the Nurses' Health Study?

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
Nurses' Health Study.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And they question them in
detail about about 200 habits,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and then they follow them
and see what happens.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is the years of
regular use of aspirin,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that is, 16 aspirin a
month, at least an aspirin

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
every other day, and
the relative risk

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:90%
of colorectal cancer.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:90%
What's colorectal cancer?

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:84%
It's cancer of your
large intestine.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the leading
cancer in America.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.607 align:middle line:84%
The more aspirin you take,
the lower your relative risk.

00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you're
an average person,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:10%
you have a relative risk of 1.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:10%
That means your average,
your risk relative

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.155 align:middle line:10%
to the average person, is 1.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:10%
To lower your risk,
the less likely you

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:10%
are to get that disease.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see,
the more they took

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the aspirin, the lower
their relative risk,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's about 0.6.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all
the studies from,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
quote, "risk factor
epidemiology" and aspirin

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and colorectal
cancer shown here,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the average
relative risk, if you take

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:90%
an aspirin a day, is about 0.6.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
What does a 40%
reduction mean to you?

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:84%
That is, if you have
an average risk of 0.6,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
you've got a 40% reduction.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, what that means is
that you get about 0.25 years

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
younger if you're the
average 55-year-old female

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:90%
or 55-year-old man.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It happens to be the same one.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But what are the side effects
from aspirin, an aspirin a day?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the side effects are
that you're 0.25 years older.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So if the only
benefit of aspirin

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
were its reduction in colorectal
cancer, you shouldn't take it.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
But there's a key point.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
What we've done here
is we've transformed

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
something from relative
risk, that even physicians--

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
unless they concentrate on
it and really fight hard

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:90%
about it--

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
can't explain and the
relative risk of side effects,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and turned them all into
one easy to understand

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
number, the age change, so
that anyone can understand it.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:10%
So they took 22,000
physicians and followed them

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:10%
for five years, giving
them either a full aspirin

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:10%
or not every other night.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:10%
And what happened?

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:10%
There was a 44% reduction
in heart attacks

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.365 align:middle line:10%
in the physician group that
was taking the aspirin.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And they stopped the
study because that

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:90%
was a significant effect.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're a man
over 40 or women over 50,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
what that means is that you
get about 1.9 years younger

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:90%
from taking an aspirin a day.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We used to think that
heart attacks were

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
caused by something like
this, which is the artery--

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
this is the outside
wall of the artery--

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
build up with plaque
and getting very small,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
so you didn't get
enough blood through it.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We used to think that was
what caused heart attacks.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So that by thinning the
blood, you could prevent them.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't what
caused heart attacks.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
It's only in the last 10
years that we know this.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:84%
What causes heart attacks
is things like this.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a plaque, and you
see it busting out here.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And why does it bust out?

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It gets inflamed, just like
your skin gets inflamed.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And aspirin's effect
is the same effect

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that you took it
for to reduce pain.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It stops inflammation, and
so that's why aspirin works.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we say, we don't
know why many of these things

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
decrease aging, that's
absolutely the truth.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We know they change
your rate of aging.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
We know they change
your disability

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and your quality of life.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.214 align:middle line:84%
But we, in medicine,
don't really know why yet.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.696 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
why you get old?

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a funny thing.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:10%
We have eight theories
on why you age,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know
why you get old.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:90%
But we do know what ages.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Your arteries get
old, and that's

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
associated with stroke, heart
disease, and memory loss.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.835 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't get enough
oxygen in your cells.

00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't get enough
oxygen in your cells.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
When your arteries get old,
you don't get enough oxygen

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
in your cells, and
that's absolutely true.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the three reasons.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The second major cause of aging
is immune system dysfunction.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Now your immune system
as you get older

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
can get either overactive
or underactive.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
If it gets overactive, you
get hyperactivity diseases.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Many forms of arthritis, many
forms of endocrine disease,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
such as many forms
of thyroid disease,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
are caused by an overactive
immune system as you get older.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Or it can get underactive.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We have two ways we
prevent against cancer

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and many immune diseases.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:84%
We have what are called
proofreader genes.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got a
proofreader gene in every cell,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
that reads the other genes.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And if your proofreader
gene gets old and sloppy,

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:90%
a cancer can slip through.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a second
part of our immune system

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
that goes and
circulates in the blood

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and tries to kill those
cells before they develop

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:90%
into cancers or other things.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Both of those systems get
sloppy when you get old.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's some easy ways
you can do things for them.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:90%
This is my favorite one.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you lift weights?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:90%
You should.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Do lift weights?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that women don't do.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes a week makes
you 1.7 years younger.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It's easy, and it strengthens
your immune system.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It also decreases our
tail system, aging,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and it decreases the
chance of having a hip

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:90%
fracture or, in fact, falling.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Why do we get fatter
as we get older?

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, a pound of muscle
uses 150 calories a day,

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.645 align:middle line:84%
even whether you're
not using it actively,

00:14:57.645 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
whether you don't
know you're using it.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
A pound of fat,
three calories a day.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
How much muscle mass do we lose
per decade as we get older?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> 5%.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> 5%, right.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
We lose 5% of everything,
right, if we don't do it.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But this is an easy way of
maintaining that and staying

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%
thin.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So, one, it helps
you to stay thin.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But, two, it strengthens
your immune system

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and decreases arterial
aging as well.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
This is another way,
vitamin D. You're lucky.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:90%
You live in Arizona.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
In Arizona, 10
minutes of sun a day,

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
you can convert your
native vitamin D

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:90%
into active vitamin D.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't
live in Arizona.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Chicago.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I could stay out in
the sun the whole day.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not at a high enough
angle to convert my vitamin D

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:90%
into active vitamin D.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you can do if
you don't get sun every day,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and there are reasons
not to, is to take

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
vitamin D. The key
things on vitamins

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
are you want an
RDA multivitamin.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Some multivitamins you
don't want to take.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
What don't you want to take?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to take
a multivitamin that's

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
got iron in it because
it disturbs, one,

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
the absorption of
vitamin C, but much more

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
importantly than that, too
much iron is bad for you.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So unless you have
iron deficiency,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
unless your doctor tells
you have iron deficiency,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't take a
multivitamin with iron in it.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Now women under the age
of menopause or women

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
who are still menstruating
often have iron deficiency,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%
so you want that checked.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't,
don't take iron.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is you
don't want too much vitamin

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
A. More than 8,000
international units a day

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:90%
also causes you to get older.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The correct vitamins or a
vitamin for optimal health

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
are an RDA multivitamin
plus extra amounts

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
of the alphabet, C, D, E, and
F, plus calcium and magnesium.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
remember the number 400.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:10%
C is vitamin C, 400
milligrams, three times a day.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:10%
Why do you need it
three times a day?

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
Because it's water soluble,
and you urinate it out.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So to keep a steady level, you
need it more than once a day.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be only
1,200 a day then.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:20.123 align:middle line:84%
>> That's 1,200 a day is what
we believe is optimal for aging.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I can go through
the, in the book,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
it goes through all
the scientific evidence

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of why that number is
what's optimal for aging.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a safe level.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the level that
has been shown to be

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
most beneficial for aging.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you get over about
500 milligrams every six hours,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
there's some evidence
it does some harm.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But where the pluses
and minuses are,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we don't know where
the exact optimal is.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
We do know that about 1,200 a
day reduces your rate of aging.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We have no data that says that
2,000, 4,000, or 10,000 a day

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:90%
is better than that.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:10%
D is 400 international
units once a day.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:10%
E is 400 international
units once a day.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:10%
Vitamin F isn't vitamin F.
It's folate or folic acid.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the B vitamins.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:10%
But I remember it by the
mnemonic, C, D, E, F.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's 400 micrograms,
mcg, more than you'd

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:10%
get in your diet once a day.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:10%
Calcium is 1,200 a day.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's 400,
three times a day,

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:10%
but you don't have to
take it three times a day.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:10%
It's just easy mnemonic.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And magnesium is
400 milligrams once

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
a day, so C, D, E, F,
calcium, and magnesium.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We've gone over
vitamin D. C, D, E,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Folate, and a multivitamin,
that makes you

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:90%
about six years younger.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:90%
These are huge effects, right?

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there are three
components of exercise.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We went over the
strength and flexibility.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:90%
That's 1.7 years younger.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Any physical activity
makes you younger.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then stamina activity,
you need 60 minutes a week

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of getting your heart rate up
to 80% of your age-adjusted max.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're sweating in a cool
room, you're at 70% or more

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:90%
of your age-adjusted max.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So not outside, but if
you're sweating inside,

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
60 minutes a week gives
you the maximum benefit,

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.016 align:middle line:90%
and it's 3.4 years younger.

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Excuse me, and this was
once a week, the 60 minutes?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it's 30 minutes of
strength activity a week.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:10%
It's 10 minutes,
three times a week

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:10%
is the best way to get
it with lifting weights.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:10%
With stamina activity, it's
20 minutes or more three times

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:10%
a week.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's 20 minutes,
three times a week.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:10%
It can't be 60 minutes at once.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't have data that
says you get younger.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But we do have 20
minutes, three times.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
For total activity, it's 3,500
kilocals a week is the optimal.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
What's a kilocal?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, walking at a fast rate
is around four to five kilocals

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Why do they call it kilocals?

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
A calorie we eat and kilocal in
exercise are the same things.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They just call them differently,
whether we're consuming them

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:90%
in or using them.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
it's 3,500 you need.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
That means you need
about 90 minutes

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
of walking or 100
minutes of walking a day.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
That's an awful lot.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any data
on excessive exercise?

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Excessive exercise, yes, there
are only two studies on it,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:90%
but they both are consistent.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Doing more than 6,500 kilocals
a week goes back to aging you.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:10%
It's presumed from antioxidant
damage or oxidant damage.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is vitamin
E, alpha tocopherol,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:10%
another name for
it is vitamin E.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:10%
But this tells you how
fast you get younger.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:10%
You see that you get
younger with vitamin

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:10%
E. That yellow line goes above
the gray line after about half

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:10%
a year, 200 days.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:10%
And by three years,
it's at its maximum.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the pearls.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to pay
much for bad behavior.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
If you never flossed, if
you start flossing now,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
you get the maximum
benefit in three years.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
If you'd never exercised,
you get the maximum benefit

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%
in three years.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And you start to get benefit
in about 90 days from exercise.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the slowest things
you get benefit from

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is taking vitamins, which
appear to be about a half-year.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
By the way, men need
to do physical activity

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
more regularly than
women as they get older

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:90%
because women normally get it.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:90%
You go up and down stairs.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:90%
You vacuum.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:90%
You make beds.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Men just sit there on the couch.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So women get some activity
in their everyday life.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.933 align:middle line:90%
Men need to as well.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:41.382 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:41.382 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Stress is the greatest ager.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:10%
All of us will have
major life events.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:10%
We'll have a family member
that is ill or dies.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll be subject to a lawsuit
or have financial trouble.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to move
or take a new job.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Any one of those makes you
eight years older in the year

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:90%
after it occurs.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Three of those and
you're 32 years older.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
If you think about Clinton,
he got 32 years old this year,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll come back to that.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is most
important for your arteries,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:90%
though, is your blood pressure.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.382 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know your
blood pressure numbers?

00:22:31.382 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a machine
out here that you

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.407 align:middle line:90%
can do it on the way in here.

00:22:34.407 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You should know your
blood pressure numbers.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It comes as two numbers.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:90%
The upper one is higher.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's when your heart
is contracting.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
That ideally should be 115.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The lower one is when
your heart's relaxing.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
It's called the diastolic.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:90%
That should be around 75.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:10%
So the goal is to be at 120,
115 over 75 or thereabouts.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:84%
How did this whole
program start?

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It started by someone
who was smoking.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.955 align:middle line:90%
One of my friends--

00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:09.955 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a friend at that
time, it was a patient--

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:90%
came to my office.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
He was having an
operation on his leg,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't walk from
here to 1/3 of the way

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of
the room without having

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.015 align:middle line:90%
to stop two or three times.

00:23:24.015 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
He was smoking and wasn't
getting enough blood flow

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:90%
into his legs.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.312 align:middle line:90%
So he said, what's my risk, Doc?

00:23:30.312 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
The surgeon has told
me that I don't have

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:90%
much risk because I'm only 49.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Simon,
if you were only 49,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't have much risk.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But your smoking makes you
at least eight years older.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't be.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why not?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
no man in my family

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
has lived to their
50th birthday,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and I got a birthday
in two weeks.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So remember, my job is
partially to reassure patients.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the job of a physician.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So now I've done
the right thing.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Simon,
you can get younger.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If you stop smoking
today, you get

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
one year younger in two
months, and two years younger

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
in five months.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And he stopped smoking that day.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't bright
enough to put it together

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
is how good a motivational tool
this was till about eight years

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
later, when I was seeing another
patient who wasn't taking

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:90%
their blood pressure pills.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I have every
one of my patients

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.607 align:middle line:84%
bring all their
pills in with them.

00:24:23.607 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So he brought two bottles
of blood pressure pills.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:90%
His name was Martin.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
half-empty, and one of them

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:90%
was hardly touched.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And his blood pressure
was 140 over 90,

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and they were both renewed, you
know, from the pharmacy date

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.575 align:middle line:90%
on them was the same date.

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Martin, you're
not taking your blood pressure

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
pills the way you
should, are you?

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And he said, how do you know?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.887 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, half of one
pill is, not much of the other.

00:24:44.887 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, what
difference does it make?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You said, my blood
pressure is 140 over 90,

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and many doctors wouldn't
even treat me for 140 over 90,

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:90%
would they?

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, but it
makes you five years older

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.077 align:middle line:84%
than if your blood
pressure were 115 over 75.

00:25:00.077 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, you live as though--

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.302 align:middle line:84%
he was 47 at the time-- you live
as though you're 52, not 47.

00:25:08.302 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You live with the vigor
and vitality of someone

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:90%
who's five years older.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And he said, show me the data.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
He'd been a physics
major in college.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I showed him
the data, which was

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:90%
from a VA cooperative study.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how many
other things in medicine

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:90%
can you do that for?

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why do
you want to know?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
this is really powerful.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.662 align:middle line:84%
People have told me
I might die a year

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
or two early if I don't
take my blood pressure

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:90%
pills the way I'm supposed to.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.113 align:middle line:84%
But no one has told
me I live older.

00:25:36.113 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he repeated
the question.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.613 align:middle line:84%
How many other things in
medicine can do this for?

00:25:39.613 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how much will
it cost me to find out?

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.297 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I know some
epidemiologists at Stanford

00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and some at Hopkins.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.505 align:middle line:84%
And I know the person who runs
the Health Risk Assessment

00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Project for the CDC
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we need a statistician,
because all this is,

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:84%
all that curve was, is putting
net present value of health

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.892 align:middle line:84%
changes just like people do net
present value of investments.

00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK, how
much will that cost?

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, about $25,000.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll need two meetings and
some research assistant time.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
To my surprise, he
reached into his pocket,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
pulled out his checkbook, wrote
a check for $25,000, and said,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.112 align:middle line:90%
I want the answer in six weeks.

00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, we gave him the
answer in about 10 weeks.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And we said, you could do
it for 60 to 70 things.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.305 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how much
will it cost to do it?

00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
much more expensive.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.472 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's a lot of time.

00:26:28.472 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It's probably at least $10,000
for each item, maybe $50,000.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It's probably $800,000
to a million and a half.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, he
reached into his pocket,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
pulled out his checkbook,
wrote a check for $50,000,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and said, get started.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll help you raise
the rest of the money,

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
started this project.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:10%
He's the one who is the
developer of the "Real Age"

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:10%
website, so you can
take the "Real Age"

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:10%
program free on the
web at www.realage.com.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It explains more in the
book, but the program

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is doable free on
the web, and there's

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
some advantages, which
we'll get to in a minute,

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:90%
on taking it on the web.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So blood pressure control,
huge effect, 25 years.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Stress control, up to 32 years.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Friends isn't just a TV show.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the great ways you
decrease the effects of stress

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is group participation,
whether it's religious group

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
participation or social
group participation

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:90%
or just having friends.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
decrease your stress.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So when something is
stressing you, call someone.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason we
gather at times of death

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:90%
or at times of crisis.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is to
reduce our stress.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Now people always
ask me about animals.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Dogs do decrease your real age.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Do they do it through
a stress phenomenon?

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, they decrease your
real age by about a year.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.742 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, cats don't.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:58.686 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The only animal that
decreases your age is a dog.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The companionship isn't
apparently what does it.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It was said better by a wise
clinician over a century ago.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Walk your dog, even
if you don't have one.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
That is, the dog
regularizes your schedule,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
gets you to take him out in the
morning, eat breakfast, walk.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Nutritional choices are huge.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Which is better, fat-free tomato
sauce or tomato sauce with fat?

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> With fat.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It turns out it's with fat.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a larger seller.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
People have avoided fat
because it's fattening,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:90%
but we need fat.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The optimal for aging, unless
we have coronary artery disease,

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:90%
is 25% of fat in our diet.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
If you have coronary artery
disease that's severe,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you can reverse the
coronary artery disease

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
by decreasing the fat, but
you cause other problems.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But there are three
reasons you need fat,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and I like to look
at nutrition, and I'm

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
going to just give it
as briefly as I can.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
There are 20 things you should
do for nutrition in the book.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The first of which is
eat only food you enjoy.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having fun
eating a food, don't eat it.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The second is, you want to go
nutrient-rich, calorie-poor.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
What's the worst
food in America?

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:90%
The worst food is white rice.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> No, way.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's got only calories.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:90%
It has no nutrient in it.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the best foods
is long grain wild rice,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's got
the nutrients in it.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So eat the foods that
have the nutrients.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat empty calories.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:90%
That goes with pasta.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Get the whole wheat or the whole
grain pasta, not the processed

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
enriched flour stuff because
you lose all the nutrients

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:90%
in the other stuff.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want
to eat fat first?

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:03.252 align:middle line:84%
One is it stops your
stomach from emptying.

00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It slows your stomach from
emptying, doesn't stop it.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
If your stomach doesn't empty
as fast, you get two benefits.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
One, you don't put
anything in your intestine,

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and your intestine is where
you get glucose absorption,

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
so you keep your
glucose level lower.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So the best way of keeping
your glucose level lower,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and high glucose ages you,
is to eat some fat first.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
The second reason is, if
your stomach doesn't empty,

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you feel full faster, so
you don't eat as much.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
The third reason is you need fat
to absorb a lot of nutrients.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So one of the best
nutrients is lycopene.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the red stuff
with tomatoes.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
There were four
studies in humans

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that showed that 10
tablespoons a week, just 10

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:84%
tablespoons a week
of tomato sauce.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.977 align:middle line:84%
What's a tablespoon
of tomato sauce?

00:30:50.977 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the amount on
one slice of pizza.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That does not make
pizza a health food.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But 10 helpings a week
decreased the risk

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:90%
of prostate cancer 40% to 50%.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Since we wrote that,
just to show you

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:84%
how fast science is
moving now, there

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:84%
are nine studies, five more
studies on prostate cancer,

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
showing the same effect, and 21
studies on nine other cancers,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
including breast cancer,
that this stuff works

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:90%
to decrease the incidents.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So eat a little fat first and
eat the right kind of fat.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:90%
What are the right kind of fats?

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Make your fats have less feet
is the way I remember it.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Bacon from a four-legged
animal, bad fat.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Two-legged, that's
fowl, chicken, whatever,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of a neutral fat.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
saturated, it's neutral.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Vegetable fats and
fish fats, no legs,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:90%
those are actually healthy.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:84%
What's the worst
fat you can have?

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's stick margarine, trans
fat, going from stick margarine

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to olive oil with
just 50% of what

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
you eat, 50% of the stick
margarine and trans fat

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:90%
you eat.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:90%
What is trans fat?

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It's partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:84%
If you substitute 50% of the fat
in your diet that is currently

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:84%
trans fat, and you're
an average person

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and have monounsaturated
fat, olive oil, canola oil,

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.860 align:middle line:84%
avocados, that type
of thing, you actually

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:90%
get four years younger.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Candy actually is a very--

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:90%
not candy in general--

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.770 align:middle line:90%
but chocolate.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything from a cocoa bean
is actually a healthy fat.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.275 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- yes-- now let me
give you the, it's only an ounce

00:32:31.275 --> 00:32:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and a half, though, is
what you should start,

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
start your meal.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> An ounce and a half,
it's actually stearic acid.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a fat that's stearic.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't raise
your cholesterol.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a neutral
fat, if you will.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Things that are really
healthy, olive oil, canola oil,

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.790 align:middle line:84%
fish oils, avocados,
all of those things

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.628 align:middle line:90%
do make you younger.

00:32:56.628 --> 00:32:58.035 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:58.035 --> 00:33:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:84%
People often ask,
what's the next thing

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.300 align:middle line:90%
likely to be in the program.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It may well be selenium.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not in there yet
because there are only

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:90%
two studies in humans.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:10%
Selenium, 200 milligrams
a day, does the following.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It decreased the risk
of cancer by 50%,

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and it reduced
death rate by 17%.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
That would mean you're
about five years younger

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:84%
than the average if you
took 200 milligrams a day.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:10%
And the US government now
through the National Cancer

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:10%
Institute has five
ongoing studies

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:10%
looking at selenium
supplementation

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:10%
in everyday people
in areas that have

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.505 align:middle line:10%
rich selenium in their soil.

00:33:41.505 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll know the
answer in about three

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 years on that.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Hormone replacement
therapy, a huge effect.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a debate
about it, right?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Everybody worries about
hormone replacement therapy.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.008 align:middle line:84%
Well, hormone
replacement therapy

00:33:54.008 --> 00:33:55.550 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
interesting things

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
because it is one of the
most powerful ways you

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:90%
can reduce your age.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But it also has some
significant side effects.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Let me go through
some of the data.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, 50% of women stop
hormone replacement therapy

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
within two months
of starting it.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:90%
What's the message?

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The message is, you've got
to work with your physician.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:90%
It isn't one pill fits all.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there are
significant side effects.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Now there are three effects of
aging of hormone replacement

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:10%
One of which is that it
increases breast tissue growth

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.129 align:middle line:10%
and uterine tissue growth.

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good?

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:31.200 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a bad.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
Because it correlates
with breast cancer.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The second is it decreases
aging of your bones.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And the third is it's one
of the most powerful ways

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
of decreasing aging
of your arteries

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.409 align:middle line:90%
and preventing memory loss.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The great news is we're now
getting designer estrogens that

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.639 align:middle line:84%
actually decrease the
risk of breast cancer.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, I would guess in
the next two or three years,

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to see hormone
replacement advertised

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that does three things,
strengthens your bones,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.466 align:middle line:84%
keeps your arteries young,
and prevents breast cancer.

00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
There are beginning to
be datas on that now.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think that'll
be a very good thing.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
As I said, even if you're
thinking about it now

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
or working with it, you need
to work with your physician

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:84%
because one size
doesn't fit all.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Now real age should
be as easy to obtain,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe, as your
weight, so you

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:90%
can know what to do with it.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we want to make it that
way, so it's at realage.com.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a free website.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:90%
You can go there.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The long program is what
I urge you to now take.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.060 align:middle line:90%
It's 45 minutes.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry, you
can do it in modules,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
so you can do five minutes
here and five minutes there

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:90%
till you get all of it entered.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing is,
remember your password

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:84%
because you can go back and
update your record anytime

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:90%
and find out your real age.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.647 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you have to
know is your health history.

00:35:57.647 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
everything in detail,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:90%
just what you do every day.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
If you take any
supplements or vitamins,

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:90%
you have to bring it with you.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you have your
cholesterol, you

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
have to know your
cholesterol and your HDL

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and your LDL or your total
cholesterol and your HDL.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%
HDL is healthy.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It takes the cholesterol
out of your blood

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and gets it to the liver,
where it gets excreted.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Total cholesterol is bad.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to know
your blood pressure.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Now do you have to know those?

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.860 align:middle line:84%
No, if you don't know
those, it will give you

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.185 align:middle line:84%
the median or average
for your age and gender.

00:36:32.185 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So it'll give you
a rough number,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and then you can go back
and add those later.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Again, you know
your blood pressure.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
You check the number, and
you fill out a tally sheet,

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and then you add it up.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But the great benefit isn't
just that you find out

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
whether you're aging
faster or slower.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The great benefit is it tells
you all the things that you're

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
not doing that you
could do and how much

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:90%
those are worth to you.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:10%
This was a man
whose calendar age

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:10%
was 42, whose real age
was 38.5 when he took it.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:10%
But you can see suggestions
underneath, increase

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:10%
his social support network
and spend more time

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:10%
doing strength exercises, and
he chose a number of things.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And with that, it let
him plan how young he'd

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
get in three years.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So while his calendar age,
three years from the time he

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
took the test would
go three years older,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.420 align:middle line:84%
his real age the way he
planned it would actually

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.810 align:middle line:84%
get about four years younger
or five years younger,

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:84%
so that in three years
from now, when he was 45,

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
he'd actually have a real
age of only 35 or so.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So he'd be 10 years younger
than his calendar age.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:84%
When Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton were

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.097 align:middle line:84%
running for the
last election, we

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
program up on the web,

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:90%
but we did have the data.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And so Newsweek asked us
to calculate their real age

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and ask them the questions.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
This is, I think, it's
August 19, 1996, Newsweek.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Bob Dole answered-- either
he or his physician--

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:90%
answered all 191 questions.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there was
concern he was too old.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was 73 at the
time, but his real age

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:84%
was 12.3 years younger,
or he was 60.7,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.760 align:middle line:84%
or Newsweek rounded
out to 61 at the time.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton would only answer
16 of the 191 questions.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.174 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how he answered.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.628 align:middle line:10%
He or his physician
wrote us a paragraph

00:38:25.628 --> 00:38:26.920 align:middle line:10%
on each of the other questions.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton does healthy
things in this area that

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:90%
included on the sex questions.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, he was
about three years younger.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So people tell me, what's the
most important thing I can do.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.168 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing you can do

00:38:42.168 --> 00:38:45.120 align:middle line:84%
is take the program, whether
in the book or on the website.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what's easy for you
may be difficult for me,

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.080 align:middle line:84%
My most successful patients
pick three or four things

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:90%
they want to do.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
They end up in 90 days
doing two or three of them.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:84%
They add one, and
they incrementally

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.750 align:middle line:90%
add and get to feel younger.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
One of those patients is someone
who's been sitting next to me

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:84%
on Oprah's show for both times
I've been on Oprah's show.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And she also has been in
a number of other shows.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.643 align:middle line:90%
She's never gotten called on.

00:39:12.643 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But one of these days, I'm
going to get to tell her story,

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:90%
but I get to tell it here.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Donna S. is someone
whose calendar age

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
was 40 when she first
took the program.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Her real age was about
four years older.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.360 align:middle line:10%
She smoked, didn't
do any exercise.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:10%
She did a lot of things wrong.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But she decided to do
tough things first.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I would have never chosen these.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.285 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm going to first
increase my physical activity.

00:39:37.285 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to do
strength exercise.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:40.267 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm going to quit smoking.

00:39:40.267 --> 00:39:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to
do some easy things,

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:84%
like taking the right vitamins,
and that's what she did.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And she's now a little
over eight months out.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:10%
And as you can see,
in three years,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:10%
she was supposed to get to
35 when her real age went

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.660 align:middle line:10%
to 43, where she was
going to decrease

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:10%
her age by about 12 years.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:90%
People ask about alcohol.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:84%
If you have no risk of
alcohol or drug abuse,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
one to two drinks a day for
men, one drink a day for women

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
makes your arteries about
three years younger.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:90%
There is a risk obviously.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The risk is it increases
the risk of immune system

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:90%
dysfunction.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
The net balance is it's
optimal for one drink at night

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.920 align:middle line:90%
for women, one to two for men.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Does the type of alcohol matter?

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:84%
No, beer is the same
as wine is the same

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:38.210 align:middle line:84%
as spirits from your artery
and immune system standpoint.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
What's the key point?

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look in the
book or on the website,

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:84%
there are 44 things
that are almost as

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
easy to do as take
an aspirin a day

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:84%
or taking the right vitamins
and avoiding the wrong ones

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
or walking your dog.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Things as easy as wearing
a helmet when you bicycle

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or not using your cell
phone when you drive.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
These are things that actually
change your rate of aging,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can elect
to do them or not.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty easy.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's
never too late.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're in a nursing
home or you're here,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
there are always things
you can do to get younger,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's never too
late to get younger.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:90%
People say, am I against aging?

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:84%
No, I want to be the youngest
98-year-old I can be.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We should end the disability
that goes with aging.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to think of aging
as being in a nursing home

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:90%
or being infirm.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
If you care about
aging, you care

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
about ending the disability
that goes with it.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of the data
that we have is

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
when you choose healthy things,
you not only live longer,

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:84%
but you compress the period of
disability at the end of life,

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.520 align:middle line:84%
so you live with
less disability.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Now there are tips of
the day on the website.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You can sign up for
a tip of the day.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:10%
I can tell you that over four
million people have taken

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:10%
the program on the website.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.380 align:middle line:10%
Over 1.6 million have
taken it repeatedly.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And a little over
400,000, actually it's

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:10%
almost 600,000 now, sign
up for a Tip of the Day.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of the Tips of
the Day we've gone over.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Know your blood pressure.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Practice a lot of safe sex.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The more sex you have for
a man, the higher quality

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.940 align:middle line:90%
for women, the younger you are.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You're all doing one
thing that gets you

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:84%
younger, that is increase
your level of education.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who
read while having sex

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.344 align:middle line:84%
probably get the
benefits of neither.

00:42:36.344 --> 00:42:37.278 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.278 --> 00:42:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:90%
So where have we been?

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:10%
Age is a currency for health.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Just like you have targets you
can set in everything else,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:10%
we ought to have
targets for our health.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:10%
It's based on
survival curves that

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.680 align:middle line:10%
have to be demonstrated
in human studies.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:10%
This is real science.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.610 align:middle line:10%
You can live at the
top of your curve.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
decline 5% per decade.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what the data says.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Why don't people do
things before they

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:90%
have a heart attack?

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You probably know
someone, maybe a friend,

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
who's had a heart
attack or had a stroke

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.537 align:middle line:84%
or had memory loss
before they did things.

00:43:18.537 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because we don't know

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:90%
the importance of things to us.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The key message is,
you greatly influence

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:90%
how your genes affect you.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes Type 2 is
a genetic disease,

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and it makes you 1.4 years
older every year you have it

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:90%
if you have average control.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you do tight
control of your diabetes,

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.860 align:middle line:84%
tight control of your sugar,
tight control, especially

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:49.040 align:middle line:84%
of your blood
pressure and exercise,

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.680 align:middle line:84%
you can age as
little as 1.06 years.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Or you can decrease the
aging the diabetes causes

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.980 align:middle line:90%
by 80% or more.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a genetic disease
that you control its effect,

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
other examples.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
We use numbers to
gauge our progress.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what real age is.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not new science.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:10%
All it is is letting you
know the value of each change

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:10%
to you.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:22.330 align:middle line:10%
It motivates healthy behavior
because, like a $50 bill,

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:10%
it teaches you what
each choice is worth,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:10%
so you can go and
pick those things that

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:10%
are valuable to you.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:10%
We've gone over a
number that are healthy.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:10%
You can go to the website or
in the book and find many more

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.610 align:middle line:10%
and choose the ones
that you want to do.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:10%
My co-author on the book
said, you don't have to worry,

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.700 align:middle line:10%
you're a lot younger
because bestsellers

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.790 align:middle line:10%
make you 25 years younger.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually minus 10
and waiting to be born.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.670 align:middle line:90%
But the data is true.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The healthier your choices,
the less disability you have.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:10%
That goes with another feature.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:10%
You should know how important
each of your choices are.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:10%


00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:10%
And then the one that
I believe is true.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.360 align:middle line:10%
People say, I don't
have time to exercise.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:10%
I don't have time
to do these things.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you show love for
the ones you care about

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:84%
by doing things
that are healthy,

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:84%
so you'll be there to share
the wisdom with your grandkids.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Simon just had a
second grandkid.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.600 align:middle line:84%
He called me in tears, thanking
me for the Real Age program

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and motivating him
to stop smoking.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're there to share
your wisdom with them, rather

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
than them having
to care for you.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not selfish.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's actually healthy.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing,
celebrate success.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.845 align:middle line:90%
When you get a year younger--

00:45:48.845 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:84%
the program tells you when
you get a year younger--

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.370 align:middle line:84%
when you get a year
younger, it's a great thing.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Buy yourself a new outfit.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Treat yourself to a
better bottle of wine,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:84%
a set of running
shoes or something.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You've done
something worthwhile.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
celebrate getting older,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:84%
you might as well
celebrate getting younger.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a better thing.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.030 align:middle line:90%
