00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's begin with
a simple question.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:90%
What is a Buddhist?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a Buddhist?

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a Buddhist can be
pretty much whatever they want

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.928 align:middle line:10%
to be, you could say in general.

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:10%
Technically, you
would say a Buddhist

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:10%
is a person who has
taken refuge in the three

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:10%
jewels of the Buddha, who
is the teacher of the way

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:10%
to enlightenment; the Dharma,
which is enlightenment itself,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:10%
and the reality
that underlies it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:10%
and the reality that
it enfolds our lives;

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:10%
and the Sangha is the
community of those

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:10%
who are seeking that same way.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So a Buddhist is one
who has taken refuge

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:90%
with those three jewels.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
They are jewels because they
are so valuable and rare in sort

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean of life's
possibilities, you could say.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
That's a Buddhist.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:10%
>> It is interesting to me
that, despite the huge variety

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:10%
of religions we have in America,
and so many of them so old

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:10%
and so powerful, so strong--

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --so many millions of
Americans are attracted

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:90%
to Buddhism these days.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Why do you suppose that is?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think because
Buddhism is basically a way

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:90%
to freedom.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The reason you take refuge
in those three jewels

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is that you want to find
freedom from suffering, freedom

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:84%
from sort of being
caught automatically

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
in involuntary responses
and sort of bondage

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to this and that drives and
reactions and things like that.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And people in America, we
sort of admire freedom.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a constitutional right of
ours to have it and seek it.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't really necessarily
know what it is.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But we vaguely feel that
if we have more of it,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:90%
we'll be more happy.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And so since Buddhism is a
sort of technical inner way

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
to freedom, it kind
of fits with our sense

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of the outer world-- you know,
our notion of political freedom

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and freedom of the individual,
this sort of thing.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is very,
very suited for that.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a method of
how to achieve that.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And people are attracted to it.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of Americans
are quite misinformed about

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in Tibet.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's totally true.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And it occurs to me
that one of the reasons

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
they're misinformed is they say,
what does it have to do with

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:90%
me?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I live in Boston.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.428 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it
have to do with me?

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I live in Washington.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Ask not for whom the
bell tolls, right?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It tolls for thee.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> We love freedom.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We think our American
dream is based on freedom.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:10%
We cannot have freedom when
anyone doesn't have freedom.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:10%
That's the amazing, strange,
paradoxical, and unfortunate

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:10%
imperative that the
American people live with.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've never
really realized our freedom

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
here because the signers of
our Declaration of Independence

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:90%
were slave owners.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, their women
didn't vote at that time.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And that was not real freedom.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It was freedom amongst a
certain collegiality but not

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
real freedom.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.948 align:middle line:84%
Then we went through
the Civil War.

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
We went through the feminist
movement-- you know,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
the universal suffrage,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But still, now we are
imprisoning up to 2 million

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:90%
of our members of other races.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
We have privatized
the prison industry.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
We're sending them up.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't build any schools
in the inner cities.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We are as bad or worse than
South Africa in apartheid

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and, in fact, now.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we feel paranoid.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel free, even still.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Even we talk about freedom
and the new age whatever,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
but we actually are
living in a society

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
where the injustices committed
to the first Americans,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans,
the broken treaties,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the injustices committed
to the black Americans,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
the slavery and now
the ghettoization

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and the imprisonment,
is still going on.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And we will not be free.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And Tibet, although as the
other side of the planet,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
ironically, is also a jail
of our own supporting.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The Russians in
the early '90s did

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
what the renowned
politickers in our country

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
said would never
happen and based

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
our whole military industrial
complex on the fact

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:90%
that it would never happen.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The Russians gave
up without a fight.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.635 align:middle line:90%
They let go of Eastern Europe.

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
They said, forget it.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
This life of armament
is not worth it.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
We want to have some Mickey
Mouse, some TV, some pleasure,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
a decent ice box.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:90%
America is not the deadly enemy.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
live like this anymore.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Then let's join the free
world type of thing.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've been
hoping for actually.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Very little help
to them actually.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese refuse to do that.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
They killed their students
in Tiananmen Square and all

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
over China, not just in Beijing.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They killed anybody
who spoke for freedom.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And then what do we do?

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.035 align:middle line:84%
We invested hundreds of
billions of dollars in them

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
since then, because our
elite is afraid of freedom.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We are afraid of our American
Dream, our own leadership.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So Tibet is so
crucial because Tibet

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
shows if we can
liberate Tibet, we

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
liberate the Chinese from that
oligarchy that is supporting

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese, which our industry,
military industrial complex,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
is supporting.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we free ourselves
from the same people.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> We get rid of them.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We convert those prisons back
to schools for the ghettos.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We educate the people
as youths, rather than

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
let them grow up
ignorant and alienated

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and then lure them into
obviously committing crime

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and then arrest them, which is
what we're doing with them now,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is such
a ripple effect?

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a whole ripple effect.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why our Peacemaking,
Power of Non-Violence

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Conference in San Francisco that
Tibet house did was so powerful

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed it was.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>> --there was a moment where
all the losers on the planet

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:10%
had a moment of
shared connection--

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:10%
the losers in the
American inner cities

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:10%
with the losers in the
international world

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called
non-existent Tibetans,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:10%
who are being genocided because
the world has decided they

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:10%
don't exist.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%

embraced each other.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The meek inherited the
earth, as Jesus said.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
But of course it was temporary.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was only a
foretaste of what

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
will happen whenever the
inner revolution emerges

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
into the open and people are
confident enough about it

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and determined enough about
it to really take action.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
18% of college-age students
vote in this country, only 18%.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Tragic.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> 38% of the total
electorate maximum votes.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, we
are a country that

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is run by an oligarchy
that does not

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%

And of course, the first
thing that person can do

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is recognize and
take responsibility

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:90%

America that the more powerful

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:10%
a person is, the less they
think they make a difference.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
The more strongly
they argue the fact

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
that I don't make a
difference, nothing I could do

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
would help, the more
ability they have to help.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And America, for
example, as a whole,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
is more than any country,
shown by the voting rate,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that has decided its middle
classes, we can't do anything.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And America sits.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And by not doing anything,
what you do in America

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is you totally add
to the problem.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You're consuming the
energy of the world.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:90%
You're polluting the world.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Your investments
abroad are supporting

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the tyrants and the torturers
and the non unionizing

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
work factories, slave
drivers and so forth.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You're supporting all of that
when you don't do anything.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And yet, America has the power.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
If America could force
its State Department

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to make human rights part
of its Commerce Department,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that would make
a vast difference

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:90%
in many parts of the world.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing we do, simply,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
is take responsibility that
what we do absolutely matters.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
everyone would do

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
is register to vote and vote.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:90%
My wife is Swedish.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And she never tires of
telling me that in Sweden,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:10%
in any election, 98.5%
of the population

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:10%
votes that is eligible to vote.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
have a government that

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.947 align:middle line:90%
cares about most of the people.

00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
do everything right.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.363 align:middle line:90%
They're not perfect.

00:09:51.363 --> 00:09:53.447 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
country with different kinds

00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of problems.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have a government
that radically does not

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
reflect the will of the majority
of its people, as ours does.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Although we want our democracy,
but it is not a democracy

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%
when 38% vote.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Then 20% of the people
can dominate the 100%.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
completely returned the
relationship around.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And how accurate
is it, do you find?

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It's about 92% accuracy.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, 92%?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:90%
That's astonishing.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It is astonishing.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I never fail to be
amazed by the accuracy.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the feedback
from the clients

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes
they say 96% accuracy.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's see how
accurate you are with me.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll be a Guinea pig for you.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Will you read my face?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love to.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the exposed
eyelids, these indicate--

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
this is like Madeleine
Albright and Hillary Clinton--

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
like to get to the bottom line.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Never mind the questions,
just get to the point.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And then in here.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
see tactfulness.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there is a tactful
side to you, which is great.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.444 align:middle line:84%
Now, this eyebrow that
sweeps up like this, this

00:17:10.444 --> 00:17:14.100 align:middle line:84%
has to do with drama, the love
of drama, going to the theater.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It's almost you come
alive when you're there.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's true.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Being onstage.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have these very low-set
ears in here, very low set

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
on the face-- so
very idealistic,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
high expectations of
yourself and of other people,

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and can be very
demanding at times.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So be kind to yourself,
not be so hard.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Something else I also
noticed is you have

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:90%
these wonderful cheekbones--

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:90%
love to travel.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Love to travel,
love to change--

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
fun to be with because you
like to do the unexpected.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to be a little
bit of a psychologist as well

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
as a face reader
when you do this.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That and personal coaching.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I use a lot of that in this.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
We use it for team building
in businesses which enhance

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:90%
the communications there.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's fascinating.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you, Naomi.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Naomi Tickle.

00:18:05.007 --> 00:18:07.881 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, as I've heard your
name, people most always say,

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
she changed my life, what
happened to you that would

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
bring you to this work?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:10%
>> I was lying on a
floor one morning.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And I opened my eyes.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's as though there was
this thing awake inside of me.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:90%
I call it inquiry.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And just clear.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So people would say, what
is this change in you?

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
well, it's clear.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:10%
And the words for
that thing alive in me

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:10%
come out like what I
call four questions.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And I can pass it on because
it's become tangible.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Once I put the inquiry alive in
me into a tangible position--

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
four questions-- we
can all understand it.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:84%
If it weren't so simple, I would
not have found it inside of me.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's easy to transfer.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
little book is about.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
What I say is judge
your neighbor.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Ask four questions.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Turn it around.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all the work is?

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:10%
That's the work.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:10%
So the work is four questions.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So you judge your neighbor--
an example would be.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
My husband should
pick up his socks.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
He should just simply pick
his socks up off the floor.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I work so hard.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't appreciate me.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I can just go on and on.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:90%
I remember well.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So today, when he leaves his
socks lying on the floor,

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I feel this humor inside
of me, this laughter

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and this connection with him,
rather than a separation.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's due to inquiry.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I like to say my religion
was my husband should pick up

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:90%
his socks.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's what
someone strongly believes.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like when someone has
an opinion about something,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
or someone, let's
say, in their lives,

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
because I think
most people watching

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
this broadcast would say, I'm
struggling in a relationship.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
My boyfriend won't
be tender with me.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let's say
that hypothetically.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:90%
So that makes you furious.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:90%
That makes you angry.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you do with it?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
How do you get to the
point where it's humorous?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So I invite people
to write it down.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so I write it down.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> My boyfriend should be--

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Tender.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Tender, OK.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what's
the reality of it?

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Is he?

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You know, sometimes he's not.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I hear you tell me that.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he is not tender.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:90%
You want him to be tender.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So is it true he
should be tender?

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you really know
that that's true?

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And where I go with that is,
can I really know more than God?

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
God of my understanding,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
not the world's or
the other way around.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell myself,
no, I can't no more.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:90%
My husband should be tender.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.462 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it there.

00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Can I really know
that that's true?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Can I really know that
that's best for him

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
or me in the long run?

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I like to say I'm not
running this show.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Everything is as it should be.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a thing that
says no mistake

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:90%
inside of me, no mistake.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So then the second
question is how do I react

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:90%
when I think that thought?

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
How do I react when I have the
thought I want him to be tender

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and he's not?

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I treat him like a
second-rate citizen, not kind.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I become pouty or I isolate.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I freeze him out, punish
him in some way, manipulate.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So then the last
question is, who would I

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
be without the thought
I want him to be tender?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And I become very tender.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I become the experience
of unconditional love.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in theory,
as you tell me that,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
it is perfectly clear to
me and perfectly logical.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But putting it into practice,
Katie, that's very hard.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I think men and women
all over America

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
are misunderstanding
each other and fighting.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And just to hear
it, it's not enough.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But something happens
in your workshops.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot make myself treat
my husband better consistently.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do that.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:10%
And somehow, when I take
these concepts to paper

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.640 align:middle line:10%
and I apply the
questions, it changes.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't change.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't change it.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I change.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
people are getting--

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands
all over this planet.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, this simple inquiry, it's
like a doing is taking over.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I call the doing
goodness and understanding

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Mostly I call it
simple understanding.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's
pretty interesting.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
To ask and meet
the concept you're

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
attached to with understanding
is the end of suffering.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why it is.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I only know that it is.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting, isn't it?

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes things are so simple
that they're complicated.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, people take
this work, and they

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
say I can get this
with my mind, but I

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
can't get it with my heart.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.053 align:middle line:84%
Well, heart is just
another concept.

00:23:40.053 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Get it with your mind.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:90%
What else are you dealing with?

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's where the mind meets
the mind with understanding

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and confusion is
the only suffering.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing here is
we are getting a clear look,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of confusion.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.518 align:middle line:90%

00:23:57.518 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:10%
>> OK so let's a moment
to the little cards--

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:10%
the advice cards,
the should cards--

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:10%
where it says, who
could use your advice?

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you have children, a spouse,
friend, neighbor, brother,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:90%
sister, parent?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Who could use your advice?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:90%
The world?

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you have some
good advice today?

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> People should not
be so judgmental.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly so.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And the next?

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> My friend Diana should be
more responsible for her own

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So each time you hear these,
go to the place where you know

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:90%
someone like this in your life,

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> People shouldn't complain.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> People should be
more open-minded.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> My ex-husband should
quit feeling guilty.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> People shouldn't be so angry.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have heard what I
refer to as our religion.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:90%
People should not be so angry.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:10%
So get a should
in your mind, one

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:10%
that could really serve you in
your life to work with today.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:10%
OK, so let's hear it.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:10%
>> People shouldn't be so angry.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that true?

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:10%
What is the reality of it?

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:10%
Are we?

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:10%
>> So the next question
is, number two,

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:10%
can you really know that it's
true that people should not be

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:10%
angry?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
This work does not have a motive
to lead you into any direction.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:90%
It has no interest in it.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:90%
This is inquiry.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you really know
that we should not

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:90%
be so angry on this planet?

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.485 align:middle line:90%
Just a question.

00:25:51.485 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Can you really know that
people should not be so angry?

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And are we angry sometimes?

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> (TOGETHER) Yes.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>> There you have it.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:90%
This work is just too simple.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just a question.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Just a question, not serious--

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.895 align:middle line:90%
go in or not.

00:26:15.895 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:10%
How do you react when you
attach to the thought,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.084 align:middle line:10%
people should not be
so angry, and we are?

00:26:27.084 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You get angry.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You get angry, yeah.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So much for religion.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:90%
This is our religion.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're attached
to-- people should not be angry.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES] It was me.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, how do you react
when you think that thought,

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and we're angry?

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Do not become angry.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you do when you're
angry, and we're still angry--

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:90%
how do you treat us?

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> With anger.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And when that doesn't
work, then what do you do?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Angrier, calm down--

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Ignore.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Ignore.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Walk away.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Walk away, isolate.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:10%
Can you see a reason to drop
this theory, this concept,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:10%
people should not be angry?

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not asking
you to drop it.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.821 align:middle line:84%
I don't mess with
people's religion.

00:27:22.821 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You know how we get when
you mess with our religion.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Angry, or we walk away.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Just simply, can you see a
reason to drop the story,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.683 align:middle line:90%
people should not be angry?

00:27:42.683 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I would have to say that
it's just because it continues

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:10%
the anger, but--

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a reason.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.457 align:middle line:84%
There's a good reason
to drop the anger.

00:27:51.457 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:90%
You get angry when we are angry.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
You get caught in your game.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you see one reason that
is not stressful to keep this

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:10%
concept, this belief,
people should not be angry?

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not
asking you to drop it.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes anger is a good thing.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you really know
that that's true?

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Can you really know that you
would not accomplish more

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
without the anger and the
energy that extends to that?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:90%
And you could be right.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking you for
one that's not stressful.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:39.945 align:middle line:10%
So sweetheart, who would
you be without that myth?

00:28:39.945 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Real.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> People should not be angry.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Turn it around.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I-- what is the turnaround of
people should not be angry?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I?

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I am?

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.545 align:middle line:10%
Is that what you're--

00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I should not be angry.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.558 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:29:02.558 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> People should not be angry.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
How many hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of years

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
have we continued to
attach to that concept,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and it hasn't worked yet?

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:10%
I should not be angry.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.495 align:middle line:90%
Let it begin with me.

00:29:26.495 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Whose business is your anger?

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
If you had to say one of three,
three kinds of business-- mine,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
yours, and God's, and that's
the God of your understanding,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
certainly not mine--

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.106 align:middle line:90%
whose business is your anger?

00:29:46.106 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Mine.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You noticed.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It's yours.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:90%
It comes from inside of you.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
it's experienced.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.224 align:middle line:84%
Whose business is
the world's anger?

00:29:59.224 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone's.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I found that
when I am mentally

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in my husband's business, I
feel loneliness just like that.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And I figured it out.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:10%
He's over there
running his life.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.893 align:middle line:84%
I'm over there running
his life mentally.

00:30:15.893 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is no
one here for me.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:10%
Of course I'm lonely.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.645 align:middle line:10%
And I'm running
the world's life.

00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:10%
People should not be angry.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.103 align:middle line:10%
My husband should understand me.

00:30:24.103 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:10%
My children should.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.582 align:middle line:84%
Lonely, lonely, lonely,
separate, isolated, depressed.

00:30:32.582 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I began to notice,
it would bring me back.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Any time you feel
lonely, frightened,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself mentally
whose business are you in?

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.530 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But we keep trying to change
them for our own comfort.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And then we won't be lonely.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.315 align:middle line:90%

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:10%
My husband, Mark, and I
own the Heartland Ranch,

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:10%
which we run with my
sister-in-law, Leslie.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And we raise alpacas.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We looked into exotic
livestock, like red deer,

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:84%
elk, ostriches, emus, and I
wasn't interested in anything

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:84%
where the only way that I could
profit was to kill the animals.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And alpacas were
the perfect answer.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We're able to make
a living off of them

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because their raw
fiber sells for more

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:90%
in its raw, dirty form--

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:90%
this is raw, dirty fiber--

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:84%
than what it costs me to
maintain the animal each year.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:32:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing with
my left hand is

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm controlling the amount
of spin that's on the fiber,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
it to get ropey.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing
with my right hand

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is I'm drawing the
fiber out so it's not

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.210 align:middle line:90%
too thick and not too thin.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.507 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.507 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The way it's different
from sheep wool

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:90%
is it doesn't have lanolin.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no smell.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Sheep wool has an odor to it.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the lanolin.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the lanolin is greasy,
and it collects dirt.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So that if you were
a sheep farmer,

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and you were going
to share your sheep,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to scour the lanolin
in acids to remove it.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.678 align:middle line:84%
And that's putting a
chemical on the fiber

00:32:39.678 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and into your environment
that you wouldn't

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:90%
need to have if you had alpaca.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's weaving.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
simplest kinds of looms.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
rigid heddle loom.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.072 align:middle line:84%
How long ago did you
start weaving, Kirsten?

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> About 5 minutes.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> About 5 minutes ago.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:90%
So I was just teasing her.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, it obviously doesn't
take a genius to weave.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And my sister-in-law
said, well, that must

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.481 align:middle line:90%
be why I do it so much then.

00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:05.834 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:84%
These are handspun
and hand-woven

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
by a group of Quechua
Indians on the banks

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:90%
of Lake Titicaca in Peru.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They do these sweaters.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.430 align:middle line:90%
They do these scarves.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They do gloves.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:90%
They do hats.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's all handspun,
natural colors, hand knit,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and they're all one of a kind.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
When I can sit up
on my porch, and I

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
can look out over the
fields and see the animals,

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:90%
they come in 22 natural colors.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.008 align:middle line:84%
And I've got more than one
of each color on this chart.

00:33:38.008 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
They're like M&Ms. You know,
you can't have just two or three

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:40.970 align:middle line:90%
colors.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have them all.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I look out
there, and I see all

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful, gentle,
intelligent animals.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, they're paying
for me to be able to live here.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
cool, because I

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
get to live in a place that's
about as close to heaven

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:84%
as anything you
can find on Earth.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And these animals
pay me to do it.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder how many people
really do know exactly what

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:90%
a clairvoyant is.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Because we say the word a lot--

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it's a stereotype.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.697 align:middle line:90%
>> --and we hear it.

00:34:10.697 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And there is a stereotype.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.472 align:middle line:84%
No, the woman with the big hoop
earrings and the crystal wall.

00:34:15.472 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I see your future.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
So what is a
clairvoyant exactly?

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's four ways
that we get divine messages.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:10%
And the most common are
through our feelings-- physical

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:10%
feelings or emotional
feelings, for instance.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:10%
And the second way is
through our thoughts.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:10%
The other two ways we
get divine guidance

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:10%
are through things we hear
as an inner or an outer voice

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:10%
or things we see,
either in our minds are

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:10%
or with our physical side.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, clairvoyance
could be very common,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
but most people are
afraid of ghosts.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's what keeps them
from seeing beyond the veil.

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a psychologist,
I've spent

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:84%
years teaching and
studying how to help people

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.150 align:middle line:90%
to break through those fears.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I find that most people
would love to see an angel

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
or would love to see an
apparition of a deceased

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
loved one or Jesus
or ascended master.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So I found that
when I help people

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
to break through the
barrier of the fear,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
the clairvoyance is naturally
just below the surface.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And because I
don't have fears, I

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:16.093 align:middle line:84%
see angels and departed loved
ones around a lot of people.

00:35:16.093 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think we're all
clairvoyant on some level?

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, I've seen studies.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:10%
For instance, Dr. Daryl
Bem of Cornell University--

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:10%
he's a professor
of engineering-- he

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.610 align:middle line:10%
was initially a skeptic
about telepathic abilities

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:10%
and clairvoyance.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.438 align:middle line:84%
And he ran what was supposed
to be the ultimate test.

00:35:33.438 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And the methodology was
as tight as it could get.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
He ran the study
11 different times.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And every time, the study came
up with the same conclusion--

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that everyone, regardless of
age, gender or background,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to be
accurate in clairvoyance.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And that study actually has
led to more scientists right

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
now believing in clairvoyance
and telepathy than the average

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:90%
person on the street.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting, isn't it?

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:10%
And you'd be the perfect
person to confirm this,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:10%
that science has become
so much more interesting

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:10%
in your kind of work.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:05.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:36:05.745 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Literally, when
I first met you,

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and probably 10
years before that,

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
people really thought of
you as a woo-woo girl.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> They did.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
work that was done

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
was very skewed by
scientists who had a bent

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.433 align:middle line:90%
to prove that they believed.

00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So now what we're
getting is we're

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.822 align:middle line:84%
getting skeptical scientists
doing the measuring.

00:36:25.822 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones who have
the most interesting studies,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're
the ones who have

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
a vested interest in
disproving psychic abilities.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
come up with data

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that supports strong evidence
beyond statistical chance

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is psychic
abilities in everyone,

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:90%
we all stand up and take notice.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you tell people
to differentiate between

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.970 align:middle line:84%
their guide's voice, the
angel's voice, and their own.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Well it's a subtle distinction.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's very much like when
you pick up the telephone,

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you pretty quickly know if
it's someone familiar to you

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a stranger
or a telephone solicitor.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same kind
of getting used to

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and adapting to the
characteristics of true divine

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.530 align:middle line:90%
guidance.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Number one, true divine
guidance is repetitive.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It'll tell you the same thing
over and over and over again.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Where false guidance,
or your imagination,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
will change its mind
pretty impetuously.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
True guidance is
always very centered

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:90%
around selfless service.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how
everyone's going to win,

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
how we can take our natural
passions and interests

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and use them to help the world.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Where false guidance
always is about separation.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It wants to make one person
better than the other.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you might
get an imagination that says,

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
this will elevate you above
others and make you the hero.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, true guidance
is going to give you

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:84%
guidance that will ultimately
help you to have abundance.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you will get fame
and fortune along with that.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But true guidance
would never ever

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:84%
talk about that as
its central topic.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:84%
False guidance
also puts us down.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's abusive.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It's critical.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And it makes us doubt ourself.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.715 align:middle line:84%
Where true guidance
is like a motivator.

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like the greatest
coach in the world and says,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.640 align:middle line:90%
you can do it.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.035 align:middle line:84%
It pushes us beyond our
comfort zone very often.

00:38:15.035 --> 00:38:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
makes people nervous.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:18.980 align:middle line:84%
When I do an angel
reading on someone,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:84%
the most common comment
I get is, I knew that.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I really felt that all along.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>> How interesting.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And they needed another
person to validate it for them.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.610 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that we'll all
learn to give ourselves

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:31.250 align:middle line:84%
our own validation
and just follow

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
our guidance without delay.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a different story
in between guides and angels,

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and what is it?

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.660 align:middle line:84%
The angels, as I call them angel
angels to distinguish them,

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:84%
very much look
like the paintings

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that you see on Valentine's
cards and holiday cards.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.500 align:middle line:90%
They really do have wings.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Although I've never seen
them flap their wings

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:90%
or use them for flying.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What my understanding
is, is that

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the original
Renaissance painters

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:84%
mistook the aura, the glow
around an angel, for wings

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and painted them that way.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And now they appear to us
that way, almost shapeshifting

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
for our benefit, so that we can
recognize who the players are.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But they come in
all different sizes.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael, for instance,
is roughly 10 feet tall.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
He's huge.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.370 align:middle line:10%
And there's Raphael, who's
a little bit shorter.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.220 align:middle line:10%
He's the archangel having
to do with healers.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel, who's a female
archangel, by the way--

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, right, and so that's
kind of neat because most

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:90%
of the archangels are male.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel is--
how tall are you?

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:31.886 align:middle line:90%
5'8"?

00:39:31.886 --> 00:39:32.686 align:middle line:90%
5'9"?

00:39:32.686 --> 00:39:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
little cherubs that

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.200 align:middle line:84%
can help out with things such
as manifesting a soul mate

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There's specialist angels that
can help us with finances,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.710 align:middle line:90%
with career, with creativity.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Basically, like people,
there's angels for just

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.030 align:middle line:90%
about any life area.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Just now, when you said
how tall are you, about 5'8"?

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Was that the angel
answering you?

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we were
having a conversation.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it ongoing
now, the conversation?

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, they
would like it to be.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have
to tune them out.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.223 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they
just take charge

00:40:07.223 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and just tell me what to do.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:84%
They've made tremendous shifts
in my lifestyle for the better.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.193 align:middle line:90%
But I resisted it initially.

00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I was just thinking that.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.068 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, do
you ever resist them?

00:40:16.068 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever say, no?

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:18.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, there are times
when I say, you know,

00:40:18.803 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
can I just go out
tonight party and--

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:90%
no, I can't.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.480 align:middle line:84%
They say there's
no time to waste.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:84%
They've got me on a very
strict no caffeine, no alcohol,

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.050 align:middle line:84%
no animal products diet
to keep my clairvoyance

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:90%
as big as possible.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.625 align:middle line:84%
Now, not anyone
should feel afraid

00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
do those things

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and be that radical
to be clairvoyant.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
They just want my clairvoyance
to be as maximized as possible.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you really
have to purify your body quite

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.420 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're very concerned.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:84%
We are going through some
tremendous Earth changes

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And Archangel Michael,
who's a powerful--

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
probably the most powerful
angel I've ever met--

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is constantly telling
me that this is it.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:90%
We're at the 11th hour.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:84%
We've passed the fork in the
road in the Earth's time.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, not enough
people are going to wake up.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And here's what the
angels have been

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to do is get messages
to everybody that it's time

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and take
care of the Earth

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and take care of each other.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But not enough
people are believing

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:90%
that their guidance is real.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not believing that
they can make a difference.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They keep they've got an
ego issue that says, who me?

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't help.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And so they're asleep.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And now the angels have to
work with those who are awake,

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the people who are on
the spiritual path.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you make a
choice to believe them,

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:90%
do you see more of them?

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And you physically feel--

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well there's
a couple things.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:10%
I think that even hardcore
skeptics wouldn't turn away

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.090 align:middle line:10%
help that's offered to
them free of charge.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:10%
And so I tell skeptics,
just mentally talk

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.378 align:middle line:10%
to angels and ask them for help.

00:41:53.378 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:10%
Look, God doesn't get offended.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no rules we're breaking.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The angels, we're not
wasting their time

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.353 align:middle line:84%
or pulling them off more
important duty when we ask them

00:42:00.353 --> 00:42:02.160 align:middle line:90%
for help with everyday things.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.757 align:middle line:84%
The angels say the reason
there's outbreaks of violence

00:42:04.757 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
in the world with shootings
in the workplace right

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
now is because the stress
level of the human race

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.040 align:middle line:90%
is at a boiling point.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And they say if you'd let us
help you with the so-called

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
trivial parts of your
life-- the commute home,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
the checkbook balancing, the
argument with your spouse--

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.990 align:middle line:84%
if you'd let us get
involved with those things,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:90%
we can reduce the stress level.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mean it's not
trivial to say to an angel,

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.470 align:middle line:84%
please send me a
parking space right now.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Parking spaces, exactly.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
They say a hangnail
is the equivalent

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:84%
of a seeming terminal illness
because in the balance,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:90%
it's all an illusion.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And all they are here to do is
support us to stay at peace.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:84%
That's our purpose
is to be at peace.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's interesting.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's them working
out God's will to help us

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.950 align:middle line:84%
by getting a great parking space
and getting the green lights

00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:00.765 align:middle line:84%
and helping you to get to the
babysitter on time to pick up

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
your child so you don't
get charged overtime.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.920 align:middle line:84%
All those things are
important in the angel's eyes.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very well
defined, Doreen,

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:11.185 align:middle line:84%
to say that an angel's job
actually is to help us stay

00:43:11.185 --> 00:43:11.985 align:middle line:90%
at peace.

00:43:11.985 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the angels are
wonderful intermediaries.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I have found-- and this is after
three degrees in psychology

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and taking a whole semester
studying conflict resolution--

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that the greatest method to
get through any sort of fight

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:84%
or irritation with
another person

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
is to mentally talk to that
person's guardian angels

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and ask them to intervene and
to create peace instead of pain.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And we see arguments
resolve where

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
it's to the point where people
develop a form of amnesia

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.415 align:middle line:84%
and they can't remember
what the argument was about.

00:43:40.415 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> That's great advice--
great, great advice.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It works like magic.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, spiritually, if
you're irritated at someone

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:84%
or you want to murder
them, it's the same.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:90%
It's all about fear and attack.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so the angels want to help
us to have love toward everyone

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and to see other people
through their eyes.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:84%
The angels are the
president of our fan club.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.820 align:middle line:90%
They see past our surface.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:84%
They see past our gender,
our race, our religion,
