00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're in this room and
you beat yourself up everyday

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:84%
about exercising, and eating
right, and all of that,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:84%
start by eliminating the things
that are draining your energy

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll never be able to
consistently do that until you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:90%
have enough room to breathe.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
How many people here have
heard about the profession

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:90%
of coaching?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:10%
Or how many people know
what a personal coach is?

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:10%
OK, just a few of you.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:10%
Let me just take a
couple of minutes

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
to tell you about
the kind of work

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:10%
that I did that led to
the book so that you have

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:10%
a context for what
we're going to talk

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.003 align:middle line:10%
about today during the workshop.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.728 align:middle line:90%
In a former life--

00:00:57.728 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
of course, I have to be
careful saying that here.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
In this lifetime,
many years ago,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I was a tax consultant back when
people did tax returns instead

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:90%
of computers.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.197 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody
remember those days,

00:01:10.197 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
where you actually got to
sit with your accountant

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.197 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of hours?

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.485 align:middle line:84%
Now you just drop
your stuff off,

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and the computer does
it in five minutes.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I grew up in
a family business.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
My father had started
a business in our home.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And back then, for some
reason, when I was about 15,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I started apprenticing
with my dad.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
gifted with numbers

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and had a very
strong visual memory.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And for some
reason, I don't know

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
why, I also had a passion
for the IRS tax code.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a little nuts as a
kid, and I'm over that now.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
But I really did.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing tax returns.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%
To me, they were puzzles.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The object of the game was
to get people as much money

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:90%
back as I legally could.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But I loved to do
the tax returns.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I loved most of
all was sitting and talking

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:90%
with people about their lives.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do
somebody's tax return,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:90%
it's a very intimate experience.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
You sit down.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
You know how much money
that person makes.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You know how much money
that person spends.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:90%
You know how in debt they are.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You know about their
medical history.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
You know about their
religious affiliations.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You know if they've
had any thefts

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:90%
or losses during the year.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a really
intimate experience,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and you have to really
trust the person

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking with to
share those kinds of details.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And looking back, I realize
that I learned my most important

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
coaching skill
back then, and that

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
was to create a safe
place for people

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.952 align:middle line:84%
to tell the truth
about their lives.

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Because once they'd
tell the truth,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
then we could deal with
the facts and move on.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And many times when clients came
to me with financial questions,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
they also had life
questions as well.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
When's the best time
to buy a new home?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Can we afford a new home?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'd talk about the
fears, and the nervousness,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and the excitement about
getting a new home.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.978 align:middle line:84%
Or when's the best
time to have children?

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There were many times
where I had couples sitting

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in front of me who were
going through a divorce,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and I had to deal with the
really difficult situation

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.308 align:middle line:84%
of handling the delicate
issues of finance and life

00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
with two people that
were really struggling

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:90%
with ending a relationship.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.212 align:middle line:84%
It was the life planning part
of my work that I really loved,

00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and the numbers
got kind of boring.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I actually was
skilled at numbers,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't where
my passion was.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:90%
So I left the--

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
decided-- I began to
have sort of inklings

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that it was time for me
to leave the business.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.467 align:middle line:90%
But I was working like a maniac.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I was a young woman.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I was making a lot of money.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I was working, on
average, 16 hours a week--

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
16 hours a week, don't I wish--

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.627 align:middle line:90%
16 hours a day.

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd go into work
early in the morning,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
especially during tax
season, skip lunch, eat lunch

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
at my desk really quick,
go through the afternoon,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
have a quick bite to eat
for supper in the back room,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and then once again
sit with clients.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm embarrassed to admit
that there were times where

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I would be sitting
across from a client,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.827 align:middle line:84%
and I swear I could
have just nodded off

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a conversation.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I was really exhausted.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The problem was
that I was living

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
such a work-centered life, work
had become just doing stuff.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Endless to-do lists
had become such a way

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
of living for me that I
didn't have a personal life

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
to go home to.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Does that make any
sense to anybody?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, some real sense.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.085 align:middle line:84%
And so every time,
I'd think, Cheryl,

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
you've got to cut this out.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:90%
You're headed for burnout.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:90%
You need to just stay home.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Take time off.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.682 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure, I'd
schedule a night off.

00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I'd stay home, and I'd be like--

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd be bored.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.905 align:middle line:90%
I'd be uncomfortable.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd be cleaning out the kitchen
cabinets looking for something

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't slow down.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And in December of 1984, I think
it was, I was sound asleep.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And my mother called me,
six o'clock in the morning.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And she said-- she was crying.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
someone's died.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, Mom, what's the matter?

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And all I heard was,
our office is on fire.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
I shut down the--

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
slammed down the phone,
threw on a pair of jeans.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%
It was freezing out.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was driving to the
scene scraping my windshield

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
while I was driving.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm lucky I wasn't killed.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And I get to the scene of
where our office building was.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, our office was in the
oldest historical business--

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
oldest historical building
in the town that I lived in.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
We had just finished
remodeling, put

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
lots of thousands of dollars
into remodeling the building.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I drove up,
there were TV cameras.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
There were people
everywhere, firemen,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.282 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing was just
totally engulfed in flames.

00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I used to be really
proud of the fact

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that I had a street-level office
with windows that looked out

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:90%
over the street.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I had this big, long,
impressive office.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.373 align:middle line:90%
It was a good thing.

00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I lived there most of the time.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And now I was standing
on the street looking in,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:90%
watching the things that--

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
my artwork, my desk,
my filing cabinets,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
everything just
melting in front of me.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember standing
there and thinking,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you don't know why now,
Cheryl, but this is happening

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
for a really important reason.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
You'll figure it
out at some point

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
that this event has
the possibility,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.022 align:middle line:84%
has the opportunity to change
your life in a major way.

00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That thought went in and
out of my mind very quickly.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.355 align:middle line:84%
And then I just remember
running to find my father.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And several days
after the fire as

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I was sifting
through the rubble--

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:90%
We just lost the whole building.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
As I was sifting
through the rubble,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I found myself sobbing over
things like my adding machine.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
We had adding
machines back then.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I was sobbing over
the pencil holder

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that was melted into like black
gunk on the top of my desk.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was actually pining
for things in my office the way

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that one of you might pine for
family photographs in your home

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:90%
if your home had burnt down.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in that
moment that my office really

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:90%
had become my home.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.355 align:middle line:84%
My home was just the
place I went to sleep.

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
My work had become
my whole life.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wish I could tell
you that that event was

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
dawn breaks on marble head, and
I woke up and went, that's it.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting a new life.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But remember when I
said I was standing

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in front of the building,
and this little voice said,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
you don't know why this
is happening right now,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.110 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening for
an important reason?

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I now realize looking back that
that was the voice of my soul.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
That was that little
whisper saying,

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
there is a better way here,
and living a work-centered life

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:90%
isn't it.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the best things I
learned while coaching hundreds

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of clients
over the last seven years

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the
quickest ways to improve

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your
life dramatically

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
is to identify and eliminate
the things in your life

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
that are draining your energy.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, when I
finished writing the book,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:10%
I sat down, and I
said, OK, Cheryl,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.902 align:middle line:10%
what have you learned as a
result of writing this book?

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:10%
What's the theme or
the lesson that you

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:10%
think is most important?

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.993 align:middle line:10%
And here's what it was.

00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, this might sound
like a simple statement,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:10%
but it's actually
pretty profound,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:10%
and that is that a high-quality
life has a lot more

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:10%
to do with what you
remove from your life

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:10%
than what you add to it.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that again.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
A high-quality
life has a lot more

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to do with what you
remove from your life

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:90%
than what you add to it.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, at
this point, a lot of us

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
know coming out of the '80s
that more money, bigger homes,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:90%
nicer cars don't make you happy.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of us on some
level pretty much get that now.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But still in our
society, if we go back

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
to just the conversation
about technology,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
we are so perpetually
outwardly focused.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:90%
We're still looking.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
Most of us walk
around as though it

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
feels like something's
missing inside.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:90%
How many people feel that way?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
You feel a
disconnection, or a void,

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:90%
or like something's missing?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Only three people in the room?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So most people say
that to me, that they

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
feel this sense
of disconnection,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
this longing for something
that they can't put a name to.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
it a life purpose.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
it a relationship.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Some people call get a
connection with the divine.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
This lack of meaning
and fulfillment,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.888 align:middle line:84%
although we know that
the cars, and the houses,

00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and money don't
necessarily fill that void,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:90%
we're still looking outside.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at what we
can add to our lives when,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
in fact, if you were
to do two things--

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:90%
yes, they get the pens ready.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Two things-- the first
thing is to spend

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
a significant,
consistent amount of time

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.470 align:middle line:84%
reconnecting with
yourself, capital S,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
reestablishing a
relationship with yourself,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and then shaping up
the life you already

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:84%
have by assessing
your relationships,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
your environment, your work
situation, your finances,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:90%
your health.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Begin to just focus in on
cleaning up, shaping up

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:90%
the life you already have.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The life you're meant to
live will unfold before you,

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and the richness and
the meaning you desire

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.972 align:middle line:84%
will start to be an
everyday experience.

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:07.437 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:07.437 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:10%
It's as if there are
cords of energy that

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:10%
run from us to
everything that is undone

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:10%
or incomplete in our lives.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:10%


00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:10%
So the favorite
dress that you have

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:10%
in your closet that
needs the buttons-- you

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:10%
know, you go into the closet.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.338 align:middle line:84%
You go to pull it out,
and you go, oh, darn it.

00:10:28.338 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to put a
button on that dress.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
You put it back in.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Chances are, you say
something to yourself

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I'm such
an idiot, or when

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.797 align:middle line:90%
am I ever going to do that?

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:90%
You put the dress back in.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You close the closet
door, and it's

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:84%
as if your life energy just
is like this little cord.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Life energy is going out of
that cord back into the closet.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.475 align:middle line:84%
Or the car you get into that
either needs to be cleaned out,

00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
or hasn't had an oil change in
a very long time, and you think,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:90%
oh--

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:90%
You think, oh, god.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
This is when the husbands
and wives or the partners

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
start to look at
each other like,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.917 align:middle line:90%
did you get the oil changed?

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Did you?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:90%
You get in the car.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
You see that it needs
to be cleaned out,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.053 align:middle line:84%
or you remember the oil
hasn't been changed,

00:11:05.053 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh, and you
lose a little bit of energy.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The cord suddenly-- you know,
you've got energy going out.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Or the office that
looks like a bomb

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
went off in it, I
mean, we know that.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.272 align:middle line:84%
How many people here have
some room in their home

00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that is so filled with
clutter that you get sort

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:90%
of nauseous just walking by it.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Now we get the hands up.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, because what happens
is, on an energetic level,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
you're losing energy
to that clutter.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just when
you're standing in the room.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.737 align:middle line:84%
I bet if I gave you--
if we did a little

00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
like three-second
visualization where

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I asked you to
imagine that room,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
you'd start to feel drained.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So we're losing energy.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And we lose energy on an
emotional, a spiritual,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
a physical, and intellectual
level all at once.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.147 align:middle line:84%
So the bigger the energy
drain, the bigger the loss.

00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for
example, this gentleman

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
over here talked
about being connected

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.512 align:middle line:90%
to things in your past.

00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, Carolyn Myss
has done a wonderful job

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
of talking about, where
is your energy going?

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Bring it back into
the present time.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that
you've recently had

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:90%
a relationship that's ended.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't end
the way you wanted

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:90%
it to end for whatever reason.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
That's like a pipe
running from you

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to the past to
that relationship.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Or if you felt like
you were done wrong

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
by a boss or something like
that, those kinds of things,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the tax returns
that are unfiled,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that's a huge pipe running
from you to the taxes.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.708 align:middle line:84%
So if, in fact,
when we're born--

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:90%
I like to think of it this way.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
When we're born, we
have a full tank of gas.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
By the time we reach 20, 30,
40, it's no wonder many of us

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
can even walk around because
the tank is way below a quarter,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So the way to begin to bring
the energy back into your body

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is to start to identify and
eliminate the things that

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:90%
are draining your energy.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
interesting things

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
start to happen.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:10%
You see, my basic
coaching philosophy

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:10%
when I was working
with clients as I began

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:10%
to develop a private practice,
my basic coaching philosophy

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:10%
was one of extreme self-care,
a concept that I was introduced

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:10%
to by my first coach,
Thomas Leonard,

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:10%
who was a man who
had amazing ability

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:10%
to take good care of himself
in ways I thought was obscene.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I was a yes woman.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:90%
He was the no man.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:10%
You could say to me,
Cheryl, could you-- yes.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:10%
You didn't even have
to tell me what it was.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:10%
I'd say yes.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:10%
I'd offer my help to strangers.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:10%
I felt drained a
lot of the time,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:10%
whereas if Thomas were
on the phone with you

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and he decided he didn't want
to talk anymore, he'd say,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm done.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.733 align:middle line:84%
He just had this
ability to just say no.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not that
I'm advocating that.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not advocating either end.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.658 align:middle line:84%
But I really needed to come
and find some kind of a place

00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
in the middle in order
to restore my energy

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.153 align:middle line:90%
and restore my life.

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So interesting
things would happen

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
as I begin to identify
the kinds of things

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%
that were draining my energy.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I tried little experiments
like, for example,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
when I was developing my
coaching practice, I'd think,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.117 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'd really love to
add a couple of clients

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:02.985 align:middle line:90%
to my practice.

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, instead of going out to
a formal networking meeting

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and passing the business cards,
which I hated and did not

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
want to do, I'd clean
out a filing cabinet,

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and a new client would
show up that afternoon.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, at first.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, yeah, this is
like some kind of coincidence.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a
sudden, I don't know,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd get the urge to clean
out a closet in my home,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
go through, get rid of
everything I no longer needed.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly two
clients would show up

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or a new relationship
would come into my life.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd meet a new friend, someone
that I really connected

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:90%
with and really liked.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I began to
practice with clients doing

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, amazing things
began to happen in their lives

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.673 align:middle line:84%
As they started to
eliminate the things that

00:14:43.673 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
were draining their energy, the
things that they most wanted

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
would start showing
up in their lives.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like the old
saying, nature abhors a vacuum.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, as they made
the space and then sat

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
with that space for a while,
higher quality events,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
experiences, people, and things
would start to move forward.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but as these people

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
focused on just eliminating
stuff from their lives,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
it was as if their
natural gifts and talents

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:90%
rose to the surface.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can almost
think of it this way.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that when
we're born, each of us

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.023 align:middle line:84%
represents a unique,
beautiful painting.

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's pretend this
is the painting

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
because I love flowers, and
they look beautiful here.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So when each of us
are born, we have

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
this unique, beautiful
painting called "You."

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's painting
is different.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to
grow up, that painting

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:84%
gets covered with dirt,
and dust, and muck,

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
siblings come along.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And one day, your
brother pulls your hair

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and goes, oh, you're a jerk.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's like somebody throws
a tomato on the painting.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.372 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:47.372 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you get older,
you go into school.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.663 align:middle line:84%
And we all know how
tough kids can be.

00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:51.463 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:53.145 align:middle line:84%
And little Johnny
in the schoolyard

00:15:53.145 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
hits little Mary in the face,
and it's as if someone just

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:90%
threw dirt on Mary's painting.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
She starts to close down a bit.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.185 align:middle line:90%
Things start to get covered.

00:16:01.185 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about it.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Then we go into high school.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.653 align:middle line:84%
It's like, everyday, tomatoes
are going on the painting.

00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Dirt's going on the painting.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
We have relationships,
difficult relationships,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
with significant others,
with friends, with bosses.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if there's
just more stuff.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.037 align:middle line:90%
Then we talk about the clutter.

00:16:16.037 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We start collecting
everything because we're

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:90%
sure we're going to need it.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We keep those piles of magazines
because we can't possibly

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
throw them away until we
go through every single one

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.197 align:middle line:84%
More stuff just gets like
piled up on this painting.

00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time
you reach adulthood,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.488 align:middle line:84%
it's no wonder you
don't know who you are

00:16:34.488 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and what you came here to do.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So instead, what we do,
because we feel that void,

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
we feel the disconnection
from that beautiful painting

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.342 align:middle line:84%
that we were when we came
here, what most of us

00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
do is we think,
oh, well, if I just

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
find the right relationship,
then I'll feel better.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We go out and start
dating or marrying

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
those people that actually
are engaging in the gifts that

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
are hidden under that painting.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.915 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's say that you were--

00:17:01.915 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
let's say that you

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:90%
were very gifted with painting.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself falling in
love with artists all the time

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because our soul
will do whatever

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
it can to get expressed.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it has
a sense of humor,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it does things
that we wouldn't expect.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:90%
But we're always trying to--

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
because we're perpetually
looking outward,

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
we're saying, OK, now
what else can I bring

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:90%
into my life to help reveal?

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.967 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to go
hire a career counselor,

00:17:28.967 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll tell
me what my purpose is.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.387 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to
hire a consultant,

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and they'll tell me.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:10%
Or I'm going to hire a
coach, and then they'll

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:10%
tell me what it is I'm
supposed to do-- when

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:10%
the key to determining
who you are

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:10%
and what your unique
talents and gifts are

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:10%
is to simply start
cleaning the painting off.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Start getting rid of
the piles of stuff,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
perusing your environment
and starting to clean it up,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
either transforming or
eliminating the relationships

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that are draining your energy,
cleaning out the office,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.818 align:middle line:84%
getting the car
handled, hiring people

00:18:06.818 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to do the stuff you
don't want to do,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
or bartering if you can't
afford it in the beginning.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.295 align:middle line:84%
And each time you do that, each
time you start getting stuff

00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
handled-- you go
through your wardrobe.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of all the
clothes you no longer use,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.742 align:middle line:84%
even the ones that
you're sure you're

00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:21.195 align:middle line:90%
going to fit into someday.

00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
That stuff drains
your energy big time.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.695 align:middle line:84%
You just start getting
rid of all that stuff.

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And little by little,
the tomatoes and the dirt

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
start coming off that painting.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you suddenly
discover your unique talents

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and gifts, but-- here's
the important part--

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
you engage a divine
force that will

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
support your efforts in moving
forward, whether you believe it

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things I've learned

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is that when we practice
extreme self-care, when we start

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to shape up the
life we already have

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and take care of the things
that are important to us,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
it's as if we send a direct
message, a direct line

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.107 align:middle line:84%
to the divine,
however you define it,

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're paying
attention and that you're

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.013 align:middle line:84%
going to honor your soul
and do something about it.

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So very interesting
things happen.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was working
with one client who had--

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.345 align:middle line:90%
he had $15,000 worth of debt.

00:19:14.345 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, you
know, I am so sick and tired

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.065 align:middle line:90%
of being drained by this debt.

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I walk around with it on
my shoulders all the time.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I may not think about
it all the time.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But, boy, just one little
mention of money, and, boom,

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.428 align:middle line:84%
it's right there, and I
start to feel anxious.

00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I'm tired of
this draining my energy.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.428 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to handle it.

00:19:29.428 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dedicate
the next year of my life

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:90%
to eliminating the $15,000.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is a single man.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
He went out.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
He decided to get himself
a part-time job, and said,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put all the
money from my part-time job

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%
towards the debt.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, great.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We worked together on
a week-to-week basis

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that he was
doing exactly what he

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.593 align:middle line:90%
said he was going to do.

00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
year, he paid off $8,000

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of the $15,000 worth of debt.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.885 align:middle line:90%
So he had 7,000 left.

00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:90%
He did a great job.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:84%
One month later, an
extended family member

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.965 align:middle line:90%
passed away and left him money.

00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Guess how much
money he was left?

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> $7,000.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> $7,000.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, once again, most
people would say,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:90%
what a magical coincidence.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But from where I
look, having seen

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
it happen hundreds of times
in the lives of my clients,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.175 align:middle line:84%
receiving all the
faxes and the emails

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that I get from people
who have read the book

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
or who have done this kind
of work, saying, you know,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:90%
you're right.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's
that engagement

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
of that divine power supporting
your efforts to clean up

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
your life.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by having you
identify some of your energy

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
drains, so then we can talk
about, how do you handle it?

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.507 align:middle line:84%
And what do you do if you have
clutter all over the place,

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:45.408 align:middle line:84%
and you think, but I can't
part with that information,

00:20:45.408 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or I can't part with
those magazines,

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or I'm afraid to
let this stuff go.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.467 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to deal
with those kinds of things?

00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:52.842 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:52.842 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:10%
Let's start by having you
identify some of your energy

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:10%
drains, so then we can talk
about, how do you handle it?

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.367 align:middle line:10%
And what do you do if you have
clutter all over the place,

00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:08.268 align:middle line:10%
and you think, but I can't
part with that information,

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:10%
or I can't part with
those magazines,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:10%
or I'm afraid to
let this stuff go.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:10%
How are we going to deal
with those kinds of things?

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by I'm
going to give you a little

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.525 align:middle line:90%
"what's draining you" test.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where you're going
to need a paper and a pen.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The object of the
game is to come up

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
with 10 things that are
draining your energy--

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.603 align:middle line:90%
no more than 10, not 11, not 12.

00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember I had one
woman I was working with.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.433 align:middle line:84%
She faxed me a list of 60 things
that were draining her energy.

00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, no wonder you
can't get anything done.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd be overwhelmed
with this list as well.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:90%
So, number 1 through 10.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
to do is I'm going

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:90%
to give you some examples.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw
out some examples

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
of the kinds of things that
often drain people's energy.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And if one feels-- if one
sort of makes you-- let's see.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.447 align:middle line:84%
If one appeals to
you-- well, no, that's

00:21:56.447 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
the wrong word because none
of these will appeal to you.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:90%
So cancel that.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you can identify
with one, write it down.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And I especially want
you to write down

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
the one that makes
you go, oh, I don't

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:90%
want to write that one down.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the one I definitely
want you to write down.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So first, we're going to
look at relationships.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.772 align:middle line:84%
There are people in my life who
continuously drain my energy.

00:22:17.772 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to think, is
there someone in your life

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.147 align:middle line:90%
that's draining your energy?

00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
If so, write their name
down, unless, of course,

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:90%
they're sitting next to you.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.058 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:22:29.058 --> 00:22:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Write somebody else's name
down, or a little code name,

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I have unreturned
phone calls, emails,

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
or letters that
need to be handled,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things that
are weighing on your mind

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I really have
to write to Aunt Mary.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It was over a month ago, and
she probably hates me now.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel a void in my life of
either a significant other

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:90%
or friendships.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.108 align:middle line:84%
That, too, can
drain your energy.

00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're walking
around feeling lonely, wishing

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that you had a
partner in your life.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.632 align:middle line:84%
It's siphoning off
energy all the time.

00:22:58.632 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship in
my life that I need to end.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a big energy drain.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was working with
a gentleman, a doctor, who

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:90%
had had a practice.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.507 align:middle line:84%
And he had hired me
because his practice

00:23:11.507 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
started to really dwindle.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And during the course
of our coaching work

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.393 align:middle line:84%
together, he kept talking about
this woman that he was dating,

00:23:18.393 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:90%
and how unhappy he was.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.098 align:middle line:84%
And they were always fighting,
and it wasn't working out.

00:23:22.098 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And now and then,
he'd say, you know,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.763 align:middle line:84%
I really just need to
end this relationship.

00:23:25.763 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
mirror that back.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.013 align:middle line:84%
You know, you keep
talking about that a lot.

00:23:29.013 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And you keep saying you want
to end this relationship.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:90%
You might need to consider it.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, as time went
on, I sort of was

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
planting the seed, mirroring
back what I was hearing.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, it
became very clear

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that the relationship
was definitely

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:90%
impacting his business.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.337 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time
sitting in his office.

00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:48.712 align:middle line:84%
We were doing a
coaching session.

00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him--

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll call him Sam.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:10%
I said, Sam, it's time for
you to end this relationship.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.523 align:middle line:10%
If you don't, this relationship
is going to kill your business.

00:23:57.523 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I remember he kind
of stepped back

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:90%
a little bit when I said it.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.203 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, that's the
hardest thing in the world

00:24:02.203 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:90%
to do is to end a relationship.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
he had been telling me.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So I said, look, you do
whatever you need to do.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
You get whatever support you
need-- therapist, friend,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.438 align:middle line:84%
support group, whatever--
to get this handled.

00:24:11.438 --> 00:24:13.355 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're going
to lose your business.

00:24:13.355 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It took him three months.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
He put some support in
place, ended the relationship

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:90%
three months later.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And his business increased
by 50% within 30 days--

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:90%
50% within 30 days.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what a huge pipe
that was taking energy.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he cuts it
off and handles it-- and, boom,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:90%
all this energy.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're talking about
energy on multiple levels here.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not just physical energy.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's on psychic, intellectual,
spiritual, and emotional energy

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's a phone call I dread
making, and it's causing me

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:90%
stress and anxiety--

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.683 align:middle line:90%
another big energy drain.

00:24:52.683 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Or for some people,
under relationships,

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
feeling as though
you miss being part

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:84%
of a loving and
supportive community,

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.283 align:middle line:84%
that can also be
an energy drain.

00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:90%
What about your environment?

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.867 align:middle line:84%
What's the shape
of your car like?

00:25:04.867 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Does it need to be
cleaned out or repaired?

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you driving around on
bald tires, dreading winter?

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
What about your wardrobe?

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Does it need to be
updated, gone through?

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Are there alterations
that need to be done?

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Are you living in a geographic
location that you love?

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Another big energy
drain-- many times,

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.240 align:middle line:84%
clients would come to me saying,
my soul wants to be in Arizona,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and I'm living in Maine.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
living in conflict a lot

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
until you get your
soul to Arizona.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you
tell the truth about it

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I'm
going to listen,

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:90%
doors are going to open up.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's another energy drain.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Are there appliances
that need repair

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%
or upgrading in your home?

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Is your home decorated in a
way that nurtures your soul?

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Is there any maybe a
room or your whole home

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:10%
where you walk in and
you think, you know,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.503 align:middle line:10%
I just don't like being here.

00:25:59.503 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times the reason people
don't spend time in their homes

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.962 align:middle line:10%
is because it's not a
soul-nurturing place,

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:10%
so they keep going
out somewhere else.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
closets, and the basements,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and the piles of paper.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.402 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.402 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Are there closets in your home
that need to be cleaned out?

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Is there a closet--

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I know when we were growing
up-- my mother would kill me

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.808 align:middle line:90%
if she knew I was saying this.

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the oldest
of seven children,

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and we had the junk closet.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Did anyone ever
have junk closets?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody
has junk drawers.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:90%
We had a junk closet.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge
walk-in closet.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.093 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, we would
walk by, open the door,

00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
throw stuff in, and then
shut the door really quick,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and never look inside.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that there's
still stuff there

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.008 align:middle line:90%
from like 20 years ago?

00:26:38.008 --> 00:26:39.967 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if people
even look in it anymore.

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And they live in the same house.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.552 align:middle line:10%
But how many of you
have those junk drawers?

00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And you open it up, and you're
always searching for things.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
one of these days,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to clean
this thing out.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's taking your energy.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
What about body,
mind, and spirit?

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.042 align:middle line:84%
Eating-- I eat food
that's not good for me.

00:26:56.042 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason that
drains your energy is

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because how many
people in this room

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.047 align:middle line:84%
have ever put some kind
of food in their mouth

00:27:01.047 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and then beat themself
up for it afterwards?

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a big energy drain,
a huge energy drain.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's been too long since
I've been to the dentist.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
most common items

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
on clients' procrastination
lists when I was coaching.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Fear of a dentist
kept people away.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But it also stopped
people from smiling.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And every time somebody
would look at someone

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
with a nice smile,
they'd be reminded.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And they'd think, oh, I
need to go to the dentist.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And they'd start
beating themselves up.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
start losing the energy.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I do not get the sleep that
I need to feel fully rested.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Is a lack of sleep
draining your energy?

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to exercise
regularly, but I never

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:90%
seem to find the time.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Is there a health concern
that needs your attention

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:90%
that you're ignoring?

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.957 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.957 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
There are books that
I'd love to read,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
but I never have
the time for them.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.445 align:middle line:84%
How many people
in this room have

00:27:55.445 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
a stack of books by their
bed that they can't get to?

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Then at the very
least, do me a favor.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Get the stack away
from your bed.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
you open your eyes,

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you kick in your adrenaline,
the adrenal system that

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.610 align:middle line:84%
says, that reminds you, oh,
I gotta get to these books,

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:90%
or when am I--

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
do you know what I mean?

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.505 align:middle line:84%
You must have that experience
where you look at the books

00:28:14.505 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and you think,
one of these days.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:84%
One of these days I'm
going to get to them.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.048 align:middle line:90%
They're draining your energy.

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Get them away from your
bed at the very least.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Or I lack a spiritual or
religious practice in my life.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people nowadays
are saying that they

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:90%
long for a spiritual community.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And that longing
drains your energy.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Then we might look at work.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:84%
My work is stressful, and
it leaves me exhausted

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
How many people are in
jobs that they can't stand?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Big, big energy drain--

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that's the pipe, definitely.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
My office is disorganized.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.905 align:middle line:84%
My desk is a mess, and I have
trouble finding what I need.

00:28:51.905 --> 00:28:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And even if you don't have
trouble finding what you need,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:10%
the clutter is still
draining your energy.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm avoiding a confrontation
or a conflict at work--

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%
draining your energy.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Here's a big one,
especially with men.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not computer literate,
or I'm computer phobic,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and it gets in the way
of my productivity--

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:90%
another energy drain.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, we'll finish
with the favorite topic, money.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I pay my bills late.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:90%
That might be an energy drain.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I haven't balanced my
checkbook in 27 years.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm clueless about
how much money I have.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a plan for
my financial future.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.038 align:middle line:84%
People will say
things like, I've

00:29:32.038 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
got my money sitting
in a bank, and I

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:90%
know I'm getting 3% interest.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I keep meaning to
find a financial planner

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
or to find a better
place to put my money,

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't done it.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:90%
That's draining your energy.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
need to get a will done?

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Draining your energy, that's
right, especially if you fly.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
My credit rating is not
what I'd like it to be.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:10%
Lots of clients, in the
privacy of our coaching calls,

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:10%
would share the
shame or the fear

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:10%
they have about looking
at their credit report

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:10%
because of how they spent money
as kids, as younger people.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting older.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I call 25-year-olds "kids."

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And then things like, I do
not have adequate insurance

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:90%
coverage.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Stuff like that can
also be an energy drain.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.573 align:middle line:84%
So those are just
some examples for you.

00:30:16.573 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
you to do is I'm

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a
few minutes, if you

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:84%
have any spaces left out of
the 10, to fill in the blanks.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Think about those
things that consistently

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.700 align:middle line:90%
seem to be on your mind.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is one time where I
want you to use your brain.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
about the kinds of things

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that you keep
procrastinating about

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that you know finally need
to get handled, and fill

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.956 align:middle line:90%
in your list of 10.

00:30:41.956 --> 00:30:44.376 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
With the magazines-- OK, I'm
going to give you my fax number

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.932 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:30:51.932 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I love this one
with the magazines.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.263 align:middle line:10%
You take all those 50 magazines.

00:30:55.263 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:10%
And you say, OK, I know this
is making me kind of nervous.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:10%
And I thought I was
going to read them.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.473 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure that there's
something in there

00:31:00.473 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:10%
that I really needed to see.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:10%
That's not true.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Take them all.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:10%
Stick them in your car.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Find an hour.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Go to the local gym.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Drop off a few at the gym.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Gyms love magazines.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Go to a local doctor's office.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Drop off some.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it depends on the
kinds of magazines they are.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.864 align:middle line:90%
You're smiling at me here.

00:31:20.864 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry, Paul.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Libraries will take magazines.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.810 align:middle line:84%
What other places take
magazine-- nursing homes,

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:90%
hospitals.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.870 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Schools.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Schools.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Laundry mat.

00:31:33.985 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Recycling centers.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Recycling, laundry mats--

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.790 align:middle line:90%
another great place.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, then you
can feel productive.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I just got rid of
all the magazines,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't throw them away.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I let them be used again.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And they do get used
at these places.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's important to know.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we hold onto
stuff in our lives

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're afraid of what
will happen in our lives

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:90%
when we let go.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a sense that might
be what's going on here.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So you get what support,
whatever support,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.533 align:middle line:84%
you need so that you
can let go of this.

00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's not
about magazines.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just symbolic.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:10%
And when you're ready
with support in place,

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:10%
when you pick those magazines
up, and you let them go--

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:10%
that's right.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:13.640 align:middle line:90%
Just keep breathing.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.140 align:middle line:84%
When you pick them up and
let them go-- everybody

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
keep looking at me.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank you-- and you let
them go, you're right.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.895 align:middle line:90%
You're letting go of something.

00:32:20.895 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:10%
And you're making the way for
something new and wonderful

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:10%
to come into your life.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you get
support when you do it.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's true for
a lot of people.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us hold on
to stuff because we

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
know on some level our lives
would change dramatically

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
if we started letting go.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, unless you're
absolutely blissfully thrilled

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:84%
with where you are
right now, it's

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:90%
a good direction to move in.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's my homework if
you're willing to take

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:90%
on the challenge.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to devote
a 30-day period,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.450 align:middle line:84%
preferably the next 30 days, but
because you didn't know I was

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
going to do this, I'll let you
off the hook a little bit--

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:84%
a 30-day period where you'll
handle the items on your list

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.290 align:middle line:90%
once and for all.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, make sure that
the items on your list

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:84%
aren't overwhelming, like, for
example, number one can't be,

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
my whole house is a disaster
area, and I need to handle it.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.387 align:middle line:84%
Number two is, my whole
office is a disaster.

00:33:20.387 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It might be that
your whole list of 10

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:90%
has just to do with your house.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Bedroom needs to be cleaned.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Kitchen cabinet
needs to be cleaned.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Closet needs to be cleaned.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Make them into doable,
practical steps.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We want to build
on success here.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to
do is, over the next 30

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:84%
days or 30-day period,
handle these items.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And start to pay
attention to what shows up

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.312 align:middle line:90%
in your life as a result of it.

00:33:46.312 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the way you're
going to handle the items.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.900 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The first way to handle
the items on the list

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the
items that only

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.310 align:middle line:90%
you can do, and just do it.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, be careful about that.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The first method of handling the
items on the list is to do it.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
that only you can do.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Only you can go to
the doctors if you

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
need to have a health
concern taken care of.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It would be great if we could
send our teeth to the dentist,

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:84%
but although I suppose
some people could.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But those are the kinds of
things we need to do ourselves,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:90%
going to the dentist.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It might be that you've
got some paperwork

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that you need to go through.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.777 align:middle line:84%
You need to go
through it, but you

00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
might want someone to
support you while you do it,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.212 align:middle line:84%
maybe a friend who's really
good at throwing things out

00:34:33.212 --> 00:34:34.770 align:middle line:90%
so you can get through it.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So the items on your
list are just do it.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I would challenge
you to only put

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
the letter D next to
those items that only

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.367 align:middle line:90%
you can absolutely do.

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
And if there is anyone
that's questionable,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
feel free to raise your
hand, and we'll look at a way

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.397 align:middle line:90%
that someone else can do it.

00:34:51.397 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So put a D next to all of those
items that you have to do.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second way to
handle the items on your list

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is my personal favorite, and
that is hire someone to do it.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:84%
If you can't afford it,
you can barter, just

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:90%
like this woman upfront said.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:84%
She's going to contact
someone and barter with them.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I've had plenty of
clients who never balance

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
their checkbook who are
massage therapists, let's say,

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
who will barter a massage
for somebody handling

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:90%
all of their bills.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I think it's brilliant.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer in
delegating out your weaknesses.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.703 align:middle line:84%
Too many of us try to build
our weaknesses into strengths.

00:35:36.703 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't have time for that.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Delegate those out, and just
stick with the strengths

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:90%
you already have.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:90%
So hire someone else to do it.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.840 align:middle line:84%
If you've got piles
of paper that you

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
know you need to get rid
of, hire somebody to come in

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and sit with you, or
barter with a friend.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.072 align:middle line:84%
Pick a friend who's
really well-organized,

00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and loves to throw
things away, and loves

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to make little files and
little sectional things.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Invite them over.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Have a pizza party or something.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And have them just help you get
completely organized-- doing

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:90%
complete work, by the way.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.140 align:middle line:90%
No half jobs here.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is about getting
this list of 10 completed.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
this room and you're

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:84%
somebody, for example, who's
feeling drained because you're

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:84%
not balancing your
checkbook or you're not

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.667 align:middle line:84%
paying your bills on time,
look at those things.

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And ask yourself,
realistically, is this something

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to do?

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's been 15 years, and
I still haven't done it.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Chances are the answer is no.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Then go out and hire
someone else to do it.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what will happen is
having somebody else handle

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of financial
things, as an example,

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
sends a message
to your wise self

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're a good
steward for more money,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and it actually opens
the door to abundance.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Let that be your motivation.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And the third method
for handling the energy

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.470 align:middle line:84%
drains is also a favorite of
mine, and that is "chuck it."

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.662 align:middle line:90%
When in doubt, throw it out.

00:36:59.662 --> 00:37:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
magazines come into play.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.323 align:middle line:84%
Magazines, catalogs, here's
what you do with magazines.

00:37:07.323 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You see, part of the
reason we hold on to them

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.293 align:middle line:84%
is we place a lot
of value on them.

00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
People place a lot
of value on catalogs.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember, catalog
companies spend

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:84%
millions of dollars
making those catalogs look

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:84%
so beautiful that you
feel guilty throwing them

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:90%
in the trash.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:90%
They do that for a reason.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:90%
What do people do?

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:84%
They put them by the
toilet in the bathroom.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
They hang onto them
for a long time.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.302 align:middle line:84%
And they figure
there's a good chance

00:37:28.302 --> 00:37:31.993 align:middle line:84%
you'll look through them one day
and order something, finally.

00:37:31.993 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's the when in
doubt, throw it out.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I love that mantra.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I keep that mantra in my head.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.842 align:middle line:90%
I live with it.

00:37:37.842 --> 00:37:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm the kind of
person where you go

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to the post office and
my post office box,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and I get all the mail.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I play this little
game with myself.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.890 align:middle line:84%
How much paper can I get
rid of before I come home?

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I open all the envelopes.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I throw all the envelopes away.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I breeze through the catalogs.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I go, nope, nothing here, put
them in the recycling bin.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can have a
whole stack of mail

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.322 align:middle line:84%
and go home with like
five little pieces.

00:37:57.322 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with the
mail that comes into my home.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Catalogs, if I don't buy
anything out of them,

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.883 align:middle line:84%
I save them in a basket, hand
the basket to my assistant,

00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and say, call them,
and cancel me.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
to look at them.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:90%
It bugs me.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Stuff in my life bugs me.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to get to that point.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, my very first
experience of doing that

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:84%
was when I had a four-drawer
filing cabinet chock-filled

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:90%
with stuff in my office.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I got so fed
up with all the crap that I

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:84%
took a drawer out, just took
one drawer out at a time,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
dumped it into
green garbage bags.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even look
at the stuff--

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't even look, took it out,
dumped it into garbage bags.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't take
them downstairs

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.555 align:middle line:90%
to the rubbish place.

00:38:35.555 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:90%
I stuck them in my car.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I drove to a friend's
business, asked

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.355 align:middle line:84%
to use the dumpster because
I knew I'd go through it if I

00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:90%
left it outside.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And I felt totally--

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a new woman.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my god.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt all this energy
come back into my body.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I was giddy.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And then a week later,
a client calls, says,

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.480 align:middle line:84%
we'd like to hire you for
a consulting assignment--

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with
exactly one of the filing

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
cabinet drawers,
everything that was in it.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here to talk about it.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't die.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do a
little extra work.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.675 align:middle line:84%
And that's back before
we had the internet.

00:39:12.675 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Now we've got the internet.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.925 align:middle line:84%
Everything you could ever
want to know in the world

00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:17.170 align:middle line:90%
is on the net.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.930 align:middle line:90%
So when in doubt, throw it out.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So the three ways are do
it, hire it, or chuck it.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Put a little C next to any
of the items on your list

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
just get rid of.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
sometimes those items

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.030 align:middle line:84%
are great ideas,
goals, or projects

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that we keep on our to-do
list even though we've

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.760 align:middle line:84%
outgrown them, but we think we
should keep them on our list.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Just get rid of them.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So remember I said
in the beginning

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that as you begin to handle the
items on just this list alone,

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:84%
you really do ignite
a divine power,

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a magical force
that will support your efforts.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You might find that on
your item is that you

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.080 align:middle line:90%
need to get your car repaired.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And you leave here.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And on Monday, you go
to the post office,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.363 align:middle line:84%
and you bump into
an auto mechanic.

00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Out of the blue, somebody--
you go to a party.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And somebody introduces you
to the exact same person

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
you need to help you move
forward with your list.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention for those things.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of
coincidences, if you will,

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.690 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of miracles
is the divine's way

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
of telling you that it's
supporting your effort

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.443 align:middle line:90%
to honor your soul.

00:40:25.443 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So isn't it kind
of funny to think

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that you can empty
a filing cabinet,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's sort of
like practicing--

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.012 align:middle line:90%
that's like meditation.

00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways we can honor
our spiritual well-being

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is by throwing
out the magazines.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what happens.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:10%
When I wrote the
book, the area that I

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.430 align:middle line:10%
did a lot of speaking and
work in was work-life balance.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:10%
And I live with
an inner conflict.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Quite honestly, there's a
part of me that longs-- well,

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.670 align:middle line:10%
let me ask.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.212 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
have the fantasy

00:40:51.212 --> 00:40:53.410 align:middle line:90%
of the cabin in the woods?

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody, right.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in this day and
age, we're living at a time

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:05.020 align:middle line:84%
where there's the creative,
bright part of us that

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.280 align:middle line:84%
loves the technology, and
the information, and TV,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and all of the stuff that
we can now engage in,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:84%
the options that we have
that our parents never had.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's fast.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:90%
That's fast-moving stuff.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
other part that longs

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.870 align:middle line:84%
for deeper connections with
others, longs for a deeper

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:84%
connection with
ourself especially,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.230 align:middle line:84%
longs to live an authentic life
based on who we really are.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.377 align:middle line:90%
It's a slower rhythm.

00:41:33.377 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:84%
You and I can't get
to know each other

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.120 align:middle line:84%
by talking fast and having
a five-minute conversation.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%
We've got to hang out together.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.910 align:middle line:90%
We have to spend time.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of us
are feeling like, uh.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like
this every now and then,

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.810 align:middle line:84%
where I just think,
what's it all for?

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:90%
When's it going to stop?

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people
will say to me, well,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, I go about my life.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well, once I get
the dishes in the dishwasher,

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
stop and relax.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, once I get
the kids to bed, then

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll be able to relax.

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Or when I just return
this one more email,

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:84%
then I'll finally
let myself relax.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, the inbox
of life doesn't empty.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
There's always one
more thing to do.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it ends up feeling
like, what isn't draining?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, I actually think--

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's the truth, based
on my experience personally

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and in working with thousands of
people, that the truth is this.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:84%
What matters most is
what you do every day

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:90%
to connect with your soul.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just meditation.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It's journaling.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It's going out with
yourself-- not to a movie

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:84%
where you're looking
out, but walking

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.162 align:middle line:84%
in the woods where
you're reflecting in,

00:42:40.162 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:84%
where you do
something consistently

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.220 align:middle line:84%
every day to connect
with your soul.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Because as you do
that, you begin

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to let go of some of
the stuff in your life.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You won't need as many
people in your life.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:90%
You won't need a huge home.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably
want to buy a Honda.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Like at this point in my life,
when I start to feel stressed,

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
the very first thing
I do is say, OK,

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:84%
what do I need to
let go of in my life?

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:90%
That's my default question.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Anytime I feel drained
at all, it's like, OK,

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.998 align:middle line:90%
what do I need to let go of?

00:43:14.998 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You look at, what are
the yeses in my life?

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:84%
What are the things
I want to hold onto?

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.747 align:middle line:84%
And you start saying
no to the noes that

00:43:19.747 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:90%
are very obvious noes.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're exhausted.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:90%
You need to go to bed.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Your friend Mary calls
and says, hey, you

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:90%
want to go out to dinner?

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And you go, I can't.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm exhausted.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's like an obvious no.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:33.998 align:middle line:84%
As you upgrade the
quality of your life

00:43:33.998 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and as you start to
let go of things,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.957 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to get really

00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
good at sitting with the wanting
even when you want something.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're going
to start having to make choices

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:90%
out of a series of yeses,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.258 align:middle line:84%
So that there are times
where if I'm feeling

00:43:50.258 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:84%
stressed or overwhelmed,
and I think,

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.732 align:middle line:84%
OK, what do I need to
let go of, sometimes

00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:55.315 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
I need to let go of

00:43:55.315 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
are things that are
important to me,

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:84%
but they're not as
important as other things.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I let them go with a sense
of, oh, I hate to do that or--

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like when
a friend calls you.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:90%
You've had a long day.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.400 align:middle line:90%
You're coming home.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And you think, oh, I'm
going to get in a hot tub

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and just relax.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.062 align:middle line:84%
And your best friend calls and
says, I just got the night off.

00:44:13.062 --> 00:44:14.270 align:middle line:90%
You want to go out for sushi?

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.192 align:middle line:84%
And you think, oh, I'd love to
do that, but I'm really tired.

00:44:17.192 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
have that pull going inside.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.848 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where we
have to learn to stop

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, wait a second.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.463 align:middle line:90%
You close your eyes.

00:44:24.463 --> 00:44:26.630 align:middle line:90%
You take a deep breath.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.617 align:middle line:90%
You check in with your soul.

00:44:28.617 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And you say, what would be
honoring my extreme self-care

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:90%
in this situation?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And your soul says
either sushi or bath.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And if the soul says
bath, you go, OK.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't mean you can
give up the sushi very easily.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.250 align:middle line:84%
You might go, oh,
I hate to do it,

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.958 align:middle line:90%
but I really have to do this.

00:44:45.958 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get good
at doing that so we

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.542 align:middle line:84%
can get a lot of the
stuff out of our lives

00:44:49.542 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't feel like
everything is draining.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm here
to tell you that I

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:84%
live a life that doesn't feel
like everything's draining me.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.670 align:middle line:84%
There are some
days when it does.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, how quickly
do you respond to that?

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.290 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to leave here.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And what matters most to
me is that when you leave,

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.540 align:middle line:84%
you take some kind of
a different action.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:90%
You take action on this list.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if not, we've
just had a pleasant chat

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:90%
for the last hour and a half.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.468 align:middle line:84%
That means less to
me than what you do

00:45:15.468 --> 00:45:16.760 align:middle line:90%
with this after you leave here.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what I care more
about is having all of you

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.963 align:middle line:84%
improve the quality of
your lives in some way.

00:45:22.963 --> 00:45:24.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the work I
came here to do.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Help me out here, all right, by
doing something when you leave.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.790 align:middle line:84%
As your life starts to change
and the magic starts to happen,

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.190 align:middle line:90%
people may call you lucky.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Clients often smile when their
friends and family tell them

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that they must have been born
under a lucky star because

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:84%
of all the magical coincidences
that just seem to happen.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, anyone
can be lucky if they're

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:90%
willing to do the work.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing to let go,
the life you were meant to live

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
will unfold before you.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very, very much.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.550 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.750 align:middle line:90%
