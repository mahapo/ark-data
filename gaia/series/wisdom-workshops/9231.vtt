00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chantal Westerman.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
unique opportunities

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.180 align:middle line:84%
we have here at
Wisdom Television

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.750 align:middle line:84%
is a great access to
some of the most popular

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and widely read authors,
spiritual leaders, and speakers

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:90%
on the holistic circuit today.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We at Wisdom Television believe
that now, more than ever,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:84%
people have begun personal
journeys, spiritual journeys.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to ask you to
join us for a brand-new series

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:84%
here on Wisdom called
the "Wisdom Workshops,"

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to meet some
of the people who are leading

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
us on those journeys.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I ask that you bring
only two things--

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
an open mind and a willingness
to look at a different kind

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.589 align:middle line:90%
of television.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.084 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.084 --> 00:01:06.537 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys had the good
fortune of having great parents

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to really lead
you and guide you.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
But you were still
kids, and you were still

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
teenagers at one point.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.924 align:middle line:84%
So what's it like to get
in trouble by Dr. Chopra?

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.256 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:20.288 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> My mom, unfortunately,
had to take up the role

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:84%
of disciplinarian because
he wasn't very good at it.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.935 align:middle line:90%

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
My name is Ocean Robbins,
and I'm 25 years old.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:10%
And what you may not realize is
that 2/3 of the world's surface

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.503 align:middle line:10%
was actually named after
me, or so I'm told.

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:10%
But actually, I
think my name also

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:10%
reveals what generation
my parents were a part of.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
When the Expo called
and asked, how would you

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
like to do an event, sort
of like the next generation

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.848 align:middle line:84%
speaks out being the theme, I
said, wow, that would be great.

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said, how
would you guys all

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
feel about having your
parents' names mentioned

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.712 align:middle line:90%
in the publicity?

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Or would you feel uncomfortable
with that, like you'd

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:90%
like to not be in their shadow?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey,
it's not a shadow.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the ground I walk on
as I carry forth in my life.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:10%
I feel so honored to be
associated with the work

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.565 align:middle line:10%
that my mom and
my dad have done.

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And these two guys pretty much
seem to feel the same way,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:10%
although we'll hear more
from them directly tonight.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it is really a joy
to be able to carry forth

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.113 align:middle line:84%
the great work of our times
that our generation is

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
privileged to be able to do.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who
are part of the '60s

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
talk about the '60s a lot.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.172 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've often noticed

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is people talk about it with
a real sense of sadness,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
like there was some real
dream alive back then,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and then it kind of
didn't materialize

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
like people hoped it would.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
say to all of you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the great dream
is still very much alive.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And despite the
assassinations of the '60s,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
despite the cultural
ebbs and flows,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
despite the consumerism,
and apathy, and the despair,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and the cynicism that
seems so rampant today,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
there is still so much hope
and so much possibility.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are still so many
people doing incredible work.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:10%
And those of us who
are young today,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:10%
who are growing up
into this world,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:10%
have not only the
problems of our times

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:10%
to reckon with but also
have the great work of all

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:10%
who have gone before us to
learn from and to support us.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to also
welcome everybody.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
My name's Noah Levine.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.415 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking forward to
spending some time together

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:48.215 align:middle line:10%
this evening.

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:10%


00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I think Ocean said so much
about not at all being concerned

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:10%
about walking in the shadow
of my parents or our parents

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:10%
but really having been deeply
inspired by the work that they

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:10%
do, and with just a lot of
hope that we could do half

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:10%
as good a job as they've
done with our generation,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:10%
and to continue to sow
the seeds of spirituality,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness, and
practice, and awareness

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:10%
with our generation that seems
to have been skipped over

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:10%
in some ways.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just really glad
to be here with everybody

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.182 align:middle line:10%
and look forward to getting
to interact tonight.

00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
And this always happens.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We did a radio show earlier,
and I was the last one to go.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And these guys always
say everything.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sort of, what's left?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:10%
This is the first time I've
ever done a Whole Life event.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:10%
My dad, of course,
has done a lot,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:10%
and he was very excited
about my participating.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:10%
He sort of considers
this part of his family,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:10%
so it seemed like a
natural for me to be here.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And what can I say too?

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just have been blessed
and very privileged to be

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
part of my family.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'd love to give--

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.027 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to give my mother
as much credit as my dad.

00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
my dad talks about,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.415 align:middle line:84%
my mom is certainly the
proof of the pudding.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:10%
So, and it's great to be here.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.837 align:middle line:10%
And we got together
this morning,

00:05:23.837 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:10%
and I met these two
guys for the first time.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing
I said to Noah

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:10%
is like, man, cool
tattoos, you know?

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we sat around,
and we said, what are we

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to
just be spontaneous.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We made some notes-- and
just create something that's

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
interactive, and
exciting, and dynamic,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and try to discover
some new things tonight.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.942 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for having us here.

00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:54.397 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We also wanted to
hear, unfortunately,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
not from everyone, but we
wanted to hear from some of you,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to just generate a little
atmosphere, why you're here,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
how you got here, and what
are some of the things

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking for?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of the
things that you're doing

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
to achieve some of your goals?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'd invite-- if
a couple of people

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
could just help us set the
tone if they'd like to.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> My awakening to who I am
really occurred when I was

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in high school and
entering college--

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and was never really
successful in the classroom,

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
really had an
inability to focus.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was led to an organization
called the Mental Fitness

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Company and became aware very
quickly of your father's work.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And that book, really, I
read about seven times.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Just read it, stopped.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Read it, stopped.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I was amazed.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
It totally-- many
of the things were

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
said in that book that
were said in a way

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:90%
that I could understand.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really led
me to continuing

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:90%
my path of personal growth.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Dina Buechler.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I live here in Austin.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I notice here
tonight is that I actually

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
have two of the people in
minority here with me tonight,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:90%
which would be teenagers.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And my concern, and
it is a concern,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is why aren't there
more teenagers here?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't there more parents
with their teenagers here

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
tonight?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:84%
This place should
be overflowing.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
That's my concern.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you
to address that.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> My own enlightenment came
through a lot of adversity.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And you guys had
the good fortune

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of having great parents to
really lead you and guide you.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But you were still
kids, and you were still

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%
teenagers at one point.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So how did your
parents discipline you?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about the teenagers.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.628 align:middle line:84%
And what's it like to get
in trouble by Dr. Chopra?

00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what does he do?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.996 align:middle line:90%
Did you get sent to your room?

00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:06.913 align:middle line:84%
What kind of things did
he get mad at you for?

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:09.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, just to answer
that question, my mom,

00:08:09.577 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, had to take
up the role of disciplinarian

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.327 align:middle line:84%
because he wasn't
very good at it.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:10%
But I'm glad--

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:10%
I think, and just
to touch briefly

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:10%
on some of your questions
also, the relationship

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:10%
I had with my parents
is that my parents were

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:10%
able to step out of the role
of just being the authority

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:10%
figure.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
They were able to be my
friend, I always felt,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
because they established
a relationship where

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I could go to them
with anything,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and I felt
comfortable with that.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I screwed up, and
I got into trouble.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And I got punished for that.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And the form of punishment
was sometimes grounding.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It was sometimes just being
screamed at, basically.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But there was also
always a release.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
ability by my parents

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
by leading by example to let
go, and to move on, and also

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
then step out of just
that authority role

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and have fun together.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.652 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things with my dad,

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the best parts
of our relationship

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is that we've had the ability to
just have a good time together,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and not worrying about
who is the parent, and who

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
is the child, who
was the student,

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and who was the teacher.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
We sort of interchange
those roles.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most valuable thing

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:90%
that I gained from my parents.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> My parents didn't do the
thing that most parents do,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
which is to call each other Mom
and Dad in my presence so that

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I would do the
same as I grew up.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:10%
And so I call them John and Deo.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.823 align:middle line:10%
And the philosophy
behind that was

00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:10%
that they wanted
to be my parents,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:10%
but they wanted to be
much more than my parents.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to be my friends.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that if
we were to get stuck

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
in roles of
parent-child, then that

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
would limit our ability to grow
into new forms of relationship

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:90%
as I got older.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.908 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
one symbolic thing.

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that people
should or shouldn't do that.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, that was one
of the things that they did.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
is to explain why.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And to say "because
I told you so"

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is one of the dumbest
responses I could ever

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
imagine to being asked, why
are you telling me to do this?

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that kids always
have a right to know why.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.522 align:middle line:84%
And even then, to
have it be a command,

00:10:24.522 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I think commands
should be reserved

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.028 align:middle line:90%
for very urgent circumstances.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
time, there's requests.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:90%
There's suggestions.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:90%
There's guidance.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:90%
There's input.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:90%
There's ideas.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And if people are
always giving commands,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
then the kid's not going
to respect it anymore

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.653 align:middle line:84%
because they know
that not all of them

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
are that important, that you
must do it no matter what.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, yeah, there's life
and death situations where

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.913 align:middle line:84%
a parent's got to give
a command on the spot

00:10:45.913 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
however forcefully it
takes to get the job done.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of situations
where it's like, put that down,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
rather than explaining why, and
then assuming that the kid has

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
the brains to respond
appropriately, and make

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
their own sensible decision,
and learn from it if they

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:90%
make a dumb decision.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And my parents really did that
with me all the way through.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:10%
So for example, with
sugar, rather than saying,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:10%
don't eat sugar, which they
felt sugar wouldn't be the best

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:10%
thing for me, they explained
to me how sugar affects blood

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.292 align:middle line:10%
sugar levels, and how people
feel tired after they eat it

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:18.375 align:middle line:10%
a little while later as
their blood sugar goes up,

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:10%
and then it goes down.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, next time you're
at a birthday party, notice.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I was like four at the time.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.325 align:middle line:84%
So the next time I was
at a birthday party--

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:27.145 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So, and you'd be
amazed so often parents

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
talk baby talk to their kids.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh, how cute.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you want this?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I used to get
really insulted

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
when people would do that to
me because my parents didn't

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
do that to me.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They'd talk to me straight like
I was a real human being, which

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:90%
I figured I was.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember going
to a birthday party

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and noticing how everyone
was having a great time.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And then the cake came out.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And everyone ate the cake.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they
were getting in fights,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and they were crabby,
and everything

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:90%
was like really obnoxious.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.897 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
isn't that interesting.

00:11:57.897 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I never would've
noticed that otherwise,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.147 align:middle line:84%
but they told me to take a
look and to see what I noticed.

00:12:02.147 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And then I knew it for myself.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't like, I
will never eat sugar again.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, I'm conscious
of how sugar affects me,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and I can make my own
choices with awareness.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the key is
to respect a young person's

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.708 align:middle line:84%
integrity and intelligence
enough to tell them the truth.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:22.205 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:22.205 --> 00:12:26.197 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:28.193 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:10%


00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:10%
But why don't we take a
little time now for each of us

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:10%
to share a little more about
ourselves, our message, what we

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:10%
want to share with all of you.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll move into some
more interactive parts again

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:10%
a little later and also respond
to some of the questions that

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:10%
have been shared with us.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.553 align:middle line:10%
>> So I just want to tell
a few stories, actually,

00:12:48.553 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:10%
instead of really going
into what I'm doing and what

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:10%
I've done, just to tell
you a little bit why,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:10%
what brought me here,
and how I ended up here.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to start with
some common questions.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, people
would always ask me--

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting lost
in a mall one time.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And while I was sort of sitting
with the person, the security

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
person, as my mom came to find
me, she started asking me,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
she looked at me and
said, where are you from?

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm from Lincoln,
which is where I grew up,

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
in a town outside of Boston.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And she kind of was a
little bit perplexed.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know, I--

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and I even at seven years
old, or how ever old I was,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I knew kind of what
she was getting

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
at because I had gotten
accustomed to this sort

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
of question.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So I said, my parents
are from India.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up--

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Boston.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I've grown up here--

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that
always sort of stayed with me.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And my skin tone is
the type, as I learned

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
when I went to college
in New York City, that

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
can pass for Hispanic, or
Mediterranean, or South

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Asian, which is a great
advantage in New York City too,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
but except if you're trying
to get a taxi late at night.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So, but then I got
to New York City.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And I had gotten so
used to this question

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that I started to ask
it of all my roommates

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I noticed is my
first day I got to college--

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and I had an
African-American roommate.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And we became
friends, best friends.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And I met my neighbor
who was an Islamic guy,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up with
this Hindu background,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:90%
but we sort of hit it off.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
One of my best friends who had
come from high school with me

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
was this Catholic guy who came
from a completely different

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
world, but we
seemed to get along.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend was a
Chinese-American girl.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I started to notice

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.992 align:middle line:90%
we do have something in common.

00:14:49.992 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody asked each
other, where are you from,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and sort of suspects that you're
not from someplace familiar.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But we started to
find stuff in common.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was the second
sort of note that I made.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to jump ahead.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And recently, as part of the
organization for which I work--

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
it's called Channel
One, and we broadcast

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
educational programming in
schools across the country.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I had gone to do a report
on the hurricane that

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
was in North Carolina and wasn't
as bad as everyone expected,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:84%
to the dismay of many
news people down there.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:90%
But we were there.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And I went to this kid.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were profiling a kid
as the family was preparing

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
for this hurricane that was
supposed to be the worst

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
hurricane, three times
worse than Andrew,

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and all these terrible
things were predicted.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And I started talking to him.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
He went to the
local high school.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And he and his
family had decided

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.292 align:middle line:84%
not to leave and
evacuate but just sort

00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:90%
of hunker down in their home.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:90%
They had boarded up everything.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I started talking
to his grandmother, who

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
was in the corner
and an older woman.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so, are you scared?

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.638 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're saying
terrible things about this.

00:15:57.638 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel safe
for your family?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
she said, oh, you know,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
we're OK because God
will take care of us.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And if God willing, we'll
come out of this OK.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.758 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
wow, that's a lot of faith

00:16:11.758 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
she has because, man, they
say this thing's three

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
times the size of Texas
and all these things.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.737 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you know?

00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to her grandson.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so, your grandmother
says, you know, god willing,

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.053 align:middle line:84%
you guys are going
to make it through.

00:16:24.053 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so, do
you think that's true?

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, he said,
oh, that's my grandmother.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.872 align:middle line:84%
We just sort of let her
think whatever she wants.

00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
But we'll be OK.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so,
are you Christian?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.943 align:middle line:84%
Because the grandmother
had made it quite apparent

00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:38.203 align:middle line:90%
she was Christian.

00:16:38.203 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, yeah.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm Christian.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
believe in God and stuff?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, yeah, but he
just doesn't waste his time

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:90%
with hurricanes.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
So that was interesting to me.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:10%
I was, where's the discrepancy
between what his grandmother

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:10%
thinks and what he thinks?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me of another
incident about a year ago,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that I went to St. Louis, and
I did this story on the pope.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
And we were at the
Kiel Center, which

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
has about 20,000-- seats
about 20,000 people.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:10%
And they had got young
people for this youth rally.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:10%
And I went around, and I
started asking the kids,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:10%
are you guys Catholic?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:90%
And half of them said yes.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:18.947 align:middle line:90%
Half of them said no.

00:17:18.947 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked the ones
who said yes, so I said,

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.494 align:middle line:84%
do you follow the
rules, being Catholic?

00:17:24.494 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh, no, man.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
That's too-- it's
too much for us.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly
what I was getting at.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:10%
And I said, so, then
why are you here?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.942 align:middle line:84%
You guys, some of
you aren't Catholic.

00:17:37.942 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of you don't believe
in some of the things

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.900 align:middle line:90%
that Catholics practice.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, but
it's the pope, man.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's the pope.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And to me, again-- all of a
sudden, I said, you know what?

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Young people, they might
not follow the rules,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:90%
but they want to feel connected.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:90%
They want to feel--

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
or they feel connected, and
they want to understand how,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:90%
how they're connected.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
And the last story--

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:90%
recently, I had gone to India.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:10%
And I was reporting
on a story in Kashmir,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:10%
where there's this 52-year
conflict between India

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and Pakistan over
this beautiful region,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:10%
but this non-strategic
region, of the world.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And they're just
fighting over it.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:10%
So I had gone up, and
I'd gone out marching

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:10%
with this anti-insurgent group
as they searched for militants

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:10%
who are in the region.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And we went out with AK-47s
and rocket launchers.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it was
intense because these guys

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:90%
are taught to kill.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't argue
with them about,

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, we're
all the same, and we

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:84%
come from the same place,
and blah, blah, blah,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because they are trained
to shoot on command.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And the funny part
is that the stuff

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:10%
about being all
philosophical, that we all

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:10%
come from the same place,
was so true in this case

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:10%
because, ethnically, the guys
that they were trained to kill

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:10%
were the same.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:90%
They share the same biology.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:90%
They share the same ethnicity.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:10%
And then I crossed
over to Pakistan,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:10%
and I started talking to
these so-called militants

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:10%
or terrorists.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:10%
And I met with one
guy in a strip mall

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:10%
in Islamabad, of all
places, a strip mall,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:10%
and I started asking questions.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And we talked for
about half an hour.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I learned he
was 25 years old.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:90%
He was a computer engineer.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked
him after a while,

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, so we hear there
are these terrorists.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got to talk to them.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I'm
one of those terrorists.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've been trained
recently in Afghanistan.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And he listed all he
could use, grenades

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and all these terrible
weapons he listed to me.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.062 align:middle line:90%
And I was sort of shocked.

00:19:41.062 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so, after about
half an hour of talking to him,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, so, look.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, you're
Islamic or Muslim.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm Hindu, or
I grew up Hindu.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And we're 25 years old.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be
hitting it off.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.133 align:middle line:90%
We could be good friends.

00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And he thought for a moment.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, he
said, you know what?

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
We could be good friends.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I
cross the line--

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and in this case, he
meant quite literally

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
when he crosses the border
as he's trained to do--

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and he says, and my
commander tells me to kill,

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
he said, I would
look you in the eye,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and I would slit your throat.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't-- it wouldn't be
personal because, you're right.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:90%
We could be friends.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, I said, wow.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:90%
He meant the line literally.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But I thought to
myself, metaphorically,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:90%
or where is that line?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.482 align:middle line:84%
You can't even find it on
the ground, let alone--

00:20:36.482 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
find it on the map.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:90%
But where is that line?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And I started to think
that line is internally.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It's somewhere in here.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's, unfortunately, it's
somewhere in here now too.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And I came back.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.015 align:middle line:84%
And this was just
a few months ago.

00:20:52.015 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
think, you know,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I've got to start thinking
about how to talk about some

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:90%
of these issues.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think in that
part of the world,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:10%
now they want the UN
to come in or the US

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:10%
to come in and intervene.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:10%
And after hearing
that statement,

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:10%
I knew that these United
Nations and task forces,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:10%
they can't come in and
resolve these sorts of things.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
These guys, and I,
myself, have to go inward

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and try to find the resolution
to conflicts like this.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of what I've
dedicated in my work to.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.298 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's not all
such serious stuff.

00:21:27.298 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I do a television program that's
geared towards young people.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.132 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to just
hear about gruesome things,

00:21:32.132 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:84%
like wars and AK-- they
liked the AK-47 part.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:90%
But so I write books.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And I do, recently, a
comic book because I

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
figured that was a cool place.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And we called it "The
Bulletproof Monk"

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to sort of talk
about spirituality

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.650 align:middle line:84%
but to talk about it
in a language that

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:90%
applies to young people.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And as much as we want to
reach out to parents, for me,

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:84%
it's about finding the language
that speaks to young people

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, they
want to hear things

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
that their parents might not
agree with because that's

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:90%
really what they connect with.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
my mission really

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:84%
has become is to be a
part of that movement,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to create that space, first
of all, where young people can

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
start to articulate themselves
and say-- sometimes when you

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
ask them and you engage them
about spirituality and things

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
like that, they say some
crazy, crazy things.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think giving
them the opportunity

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.707 align:middle line:84%
to start voicing some of their
concerns and their priorities,

00:22:34.707 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and what's important
to them, and what

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
are the things that they believe
in, whether or not the pope,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
what's brought me here

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.888 align:middle line:90%
and to talk to you guys.

00:22:46.888 --> 00:22:49.333 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:52.756 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:54.712 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:54.712 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to tell a
few stories as well.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:10%
One defining moment
in my life occurred

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:10%
when I was six years old.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:10%
And my dad and I
were going for a walk

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:10%
at the beach in Victoria,
British Columbia, Canada,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:10%
where we were
living at that time.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of a cold day.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking along
and then, about 50 feet ahead

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
of us, seeing this mother
with her maybe 3-year-old son.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was screaming
at him and slapping him.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And he was screaming and crying.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I heard her saying, don't
you ever talk back to me again.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like kind
of a violent situation.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I reached over and
grabbed my dad's hand,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and he held my hand firmly.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.472 align:middle line:84%
And he kept on
walking towards them.

00:23:47.472 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he said something
that I'll always remember.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's no
monsters in this world.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
There's just people
who've been hurt.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you see someone
hurting somebody else,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
it's because somebody
hurt them once.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:90%
You can know that for a fact.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the cycle of pain
just keeps on going.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
People get hurt.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
They lash out at others.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The cycle continues until
somebody says, enough.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
this is enough.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And he walked over
towards this woman.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was holding his
hand a little bit behind.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And she was continuing
to yell at the child

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and slap him in the face.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was screaming and
clearly very frightened.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
tears in his eyes.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they were so
caught up in their thing,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
they didn't notice us
until we were right there.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And then my dad said, excuse me.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And she spun around and
looked pretty upset.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, it looked like
you were having a hard time,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and I wondered if we
could be of any help.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's
none of your business,

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and looked quite upset at him.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And he just said, well,
I'm sorry to bother you,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted you to know
that we're here to support you

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:90%
if there's any way we can.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like you're having
a bit of a rough time here.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.225 align:middle line:90%
And she stopped for a moment.

00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought she might be
about to lash out again.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But then I saw this look of kind
of shame pass over her face.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'm sorry.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not normally like this.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I just broke
up with my boyfriend, his dad.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And it just seems
like everything's

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:90%
falling apart around me.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so then my dad
and her started

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:90%
conversing a little bit.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled out this little
toy car I had in my pocket

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and started playing with this
boy, whose name was Michael.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And we start playing on the
beach for a few minutes.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.885 align:middle line:84%
And I could see them
talking a little ways away.

00:25:45.885 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Then at a certain point,
they came over towards us.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could see her
expressing her appreciation.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, it's
so good to have someone

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:90%
to talk to about all this.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And then she came over, and
she picked him up and said,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:90%
it's OK now.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to worry.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.247 align:middle line:84%
We're in this together, and
we'll get through it together.

00:26:04.247 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that he didn't
know whether to believe her

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was still
kind of frightened.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And I handed him the toy car.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, this is for you.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.962 align:middle line:84%
And this big smile
came over his face.

00:26:17.962 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
what do you say?

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was kind of more
commanding than asking.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.682 align:middle line:84%
But he said, thank you, and
the smile got even bigger.

00:26:25.682 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And then she said, thank you.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And then she carried him
off, and my dad picked me up

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and carried me off.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I never forgot
that moment because I'd

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.542 align:middle line:84%
learned at the age of six,
not just through words

00:26:36.542 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but through example,
about the power of meeting

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
hatred with love, which is
really what that was all about.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And it might seem like not
that significant an event.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we've all seen things
like that happen before.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But so often, we turn
away, or we judge somebody

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
without really understanding
what's happening for them

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
or reaching out to make a
difference in their lives.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I was 10 years old,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to jump to another story, we had
a fruit fly problem, a big one,

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
like there were fruit flies
all over the house, clouds

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and swarms.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was getting
kind of serious.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.202 align:middle line:10%
And at that time,
my dad was actually

00:27:12.202 --> 00:27:13.630 align:middle line:10%
writing "Diet For
a New America."

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:10%
And he was writing the
chapter, the first chapter,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:10%
which deals with animals
and how they're really

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.955 align:middle line:10%
very intelligent,
and in their own way,

00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:10%
and they certainly
have feelings.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And so we didn't know
what to do because here he

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:10%
was writing this
amazing material

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:10%
about the power of animals.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:10%
And yet it was a problem.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And my mom said, I
can't take it anymore.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a fly swatter.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.438 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:27:35.438 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Deo, stop.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Give me 24 hours to
use non-violent means.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
She said, all right.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one day.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But this has got to-- this
is pretty serious here.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote a letter.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.365 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dear fruit flies--

00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Let me first begin by
expressing my sincere respect.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I wish you the juiciest cow dung
piles and the biggest compost

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
heap for you and all
the generations to come.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Let me also state, however,
that this is our house

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and not yours.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We pay rent here.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:90%
We buy the food here.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of food outside
that you can eat that we can't.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But our stomachs
are very limited.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So we can only eat
what's in here.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
If you would simply go to
the compost pile outside,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
there would be
enough for all of us.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Your presence here is creating
some real problems for us,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and we can't have
you here anymore.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to know that we
have purchased a fly swatter,

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.835 align:middle line:84%
and we intend to use it if you
are not gone by dawn tomorrow.

00:28:39.835 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.988 align:middle line:84%
So I then opened
a window partway.

00:28:46.988 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:84%
We had tried opening
all the windows.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like more
flies came in before.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I
opened a window partway.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And I put the note
up near the window

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and drew an arrow
pointing to the opening,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and said, please exit
through this opening.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I read it aloud just
in case some of the fruit flies

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%
couldn't read.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were buzzing all
over the place that day.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I went to sleep that night,
woke up in the morning.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.196 align:middle line:84%
There was not a
fly in the house.

00:29:17.196 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I left the note up for a
couple weeks, took it down,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:90%
fruit flies coming back--

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.795 align:middle line:84%
put it up, next
day at dawn, gone.

00:29:26.795 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It tried it with
a raccoon that was

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
breaking into where
we fed our cats

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and eating their cat food--

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.855 align:middle line:90%
same thing, stopped coming.

00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I tried it with wasps
on a camping trip.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.295 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:39.235 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:42.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So two for three, I decided
I'd just leave it there

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:90%
for the moment.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going into the
pest extermination business

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.280 align:middle line:90%
quite yet.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was very inspirational
to me to see all that happen.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I presuming that
the flies read the letter?

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Am I presuming that
they understood

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.447 align:middle line:90%
my reading the letter?

00:29:59.447 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily, but there was
some level of communication

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:90%
that obviously occurred.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up
believing in miracles.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I grew up believing that those
kind of things could happen.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and dad, even though
they were perhaps a little bit

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.053 align:middle line:84%
skeptical, were willing
to give it a try.

00:30:18.053 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I have seen

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.895 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of adults have this
image that young people today

00:30:21.895 --> 00:30:22.695 align:middle line:90%
don't care.

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:24.278 align:middle line:10%
And they say, oh,
it's so great to see

00:30:24.278 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:10%
a young person who cares about
what's happening in the world.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And I get kind of
upset when I hear that.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:10%
Because the truth is that
young people today care a lot.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're tremendously
informed about what's

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're so
cynical because they also

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.868 align:middle line:84%
don't couple that
information with action.

00:30:41.868 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that whenever we
learn about something that

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.085 align:middle line:84%
brings pain to us, we have to
have some way of responding,

00:30:47.085 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that
our lives matter.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we have an
impulse to respond.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you see a
story on the television

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:84%
about some vast disaster
or some horrible suffering,

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:84%
you are powerless
to interact with it.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.343 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be that when
we'd learn about something,

00:31:00.343 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
it was usually around
us, and we could usually

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.288 align:middle line:90%
do something about it.

00:31:03.288 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But today, more and
more young people

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
are faced with this
feeling of powerlessness.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they feel
powerless, they

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:84%
feel hopeless because power
and hope are very intertwined.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say that we've
asked about several hundred

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
thousand students whether
they believe the world will

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:84%
be a better place in 30 years,
with less violence and less

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:90%
pollution.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say that 95% of
them do not, so that only 5%

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of the high school students
in the United States today

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
are optimistic that
in one generation

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
the world will be
a better place.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.673 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
pretty terrifying.

00:31:37.673 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And no one can
hear that and think

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that young people don't care.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that
youth care a lot.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:90%
They know a lot.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to adults to
try and set an example

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that our lives do
make a difference.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.472 align:middle line:84%
And nothing is more powerful
than example on that.

00:31:55.472 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you something else.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Amongst the youth
who are active,

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:84%
who are involved in
environmental clubs,

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
in social justice clubs,
in human rights clubs, who

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:84%
are organizing for
positive change, 50% to 75%

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
believe the world will be a
better place in a generation.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.013 align:middle line:84%
Is that because they're more
informed or more educated?

00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, but, ultimately,
it's because they're

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:90%
doing something.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We tend to project
outward on the world

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.053 align:middle line:84%
our expectations of the world
from what's inside of us.

00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you should
always go around with the belief

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:90%
that things will get better.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.595 align:middle line:10%
My dad has often said that
hope is the belief that things

00:32:28.595 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:10%
will get better, and
fear is the belief

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:10%
that things will get worse.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:10%
And if we're really going to
have substance to our lives,

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:10%
we need to draw our strength
not so much from hope or fear

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:10%
as from love.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Because love matters.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Love is eternal.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of love we ever
express makes a difference.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It lasts forever.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, truly, we need
to know the power of our hearts

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference in our
families, in our communities,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.632 align:middle line:90%
and in our world.

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we can come
from that place,

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.000 align:middle line:84%
we will see some, I think,
some awesome changes.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we need to
find our strength not in what

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
we see in the world around
us but in the dreams that

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:84%
live within us, in the
hopes, in the prayers,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in the possibilities that we
carry in our hearts and souls.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the problems
we face in the world today

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
are not more
reasons for despair.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They are a call to
a place inside us

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that says, no,
this is not right.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to stand by and
let life on Earth be destroyed.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not OK with me that half
of the world's population

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is malnourished or hungry,
the greatest percentage ever.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not OK with me that we
live under a nuclear shadow.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of human life,
all of life on this planet

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:84%
could be annihilated
forever in an hour.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to stand
by and let this go on.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
something about it.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And we all carry inside of us,
I believe, anger, sorrow, grief,

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and love in response to the
challenges of our times.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We need to be willing
to face those feelings.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But we can't just stop
with feeling them.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
We can't just stop
with knowing the facts.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:84%
We've got to take the
next step into action.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
What kind of action is as
diverse as the human race?

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was starting an
organization, and doing a tour,

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and putting on summer camps
to empower our generation

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.239 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
organizing recycling projects.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's working
on environmental justice issues.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's working
on the economic disparity

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:90%
in our country and in our world.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.790 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
working to end homelessness.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
There are so many areas
where we need to work.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We need to heal
racism, and sexism,

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and the list goes on and on.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.043 align:middle line:90%
And you all know it.

00:34:41.043 --> 00:34:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And you could certainly
make a longer list than I.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
And yet each of us, I
believe, inside of our hearts

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:84%
carries a calling,
carries a dream,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
carries a vision of what
this world could be,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and carries everything we
need to make the difference

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:90%
that we're here for.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So what is that
difference, I ask, guests?

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
we should all immediately

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:90%
have our answer.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.080 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's a question
that I ask every day.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Saint Francis said, "Lord, make
me an instrument of peace."

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So I ask myself
every day, how can I

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
be an instrument of peace and
healing in this world today

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and in this moment,
and in this moment?

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And I try to keep
coming back to that.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't always
have the answer,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
but I can always
return to the question.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.165 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:34.075 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.075 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:10%


00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was growing up,
I, completely and totally,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:10%
dutifully rebelled against
everything that my parents

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:10%
stand for.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
When I was 17 years old, I
was sitting in juvenile hall.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd been there several
times that month.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And the pain, the
internal stuff was so much

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that when my father said, I
want you to try some meditation,

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I was in enough pain to
hear him and say, oh, OK.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And also at that same time
was the first time in my life

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:90%
where I was in trouble.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been in
trouble my whole life.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
everybody else.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Trouble was always about them,
and it was always external.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time I
saw like, oh, it's not.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.350 align:middle line:90%
It's internal.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.330 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is within
me, like Gotham

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:84%
was saying, that line in
my heart, not a border,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
but with that place
within me where

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't showing up for myself.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And so although
I'd been brought up

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
with meditation, with
spiritual practice,

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:84%
with compassion, with
love, unconditional love,

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have it for myself.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And but in that moment,
for whatever reason,

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:84%
even though it had been
said so many times,

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:90%
you know, try meditation.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Try whatever.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
My parents never tried
to push it on me at all.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:90%
But it was available.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The seeds had been
sown for sure.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I started watching
my own inner experience.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I started looking at--

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.310 align:middle line:84%
well, just watching my breath
was the first instruction

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.110 align:middle line:90%
that I was given.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Just watch it.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in, count it.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Breath, say one,
breathing out, say two.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I sat there in my cell.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, 1, 2.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.073 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get to
10, and I couldn't really

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:90%
get to 10.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
over the few months

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that I was institutionalized,
and put into a group home,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff that I went
through, I started to meditate.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And I also started to pray.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I started to look at myself
and about how unhappy I was.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I did these
practices, I started

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to feel better, a
little bit better.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked at like,
I'm looking for happiness.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.060 align:middle line:84%
All of the crimes that I
committed, it was about I

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.430 align:middle line:84%
thought that if I did
that, I'd be happy.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything in my
life, every action

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that I had taken in
whatever confused

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:90%
way was looking for happiness.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
do spiritual practice,

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I started to find some
happiness from the uni--

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:84%
through whatever you
want to call it--

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
god, the universe, the heart,
yourself, your true nature,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.930 align:middle line:84%
so many different words
for the same thing

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that I kind of
started to tap into.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And me being a fairly
compulsive type of person,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:90%
I got a taste of it.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, this is great.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Serenity, peace, happiness, I
want this more than anything.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Drugs and alcohol
don't even compare

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:84%
to the type of happiness
that I started to find.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Just being comfortable, being
free from stress and fear,

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:90%
wow, this is amazing.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I started sitting meditation
retreats, just doing it,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and went to India--

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.765 align:middle line:90%
just, my life changed.

00:39:48.765 --> 00:39:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:10%
So I guess that's what's
bringing me here today.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.120 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, a
couple years ago,

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.970 align:middle line:90%
after getting back from India--

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and as my life changed, and
people started saying like,

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Noah, you used to be so angry.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.020 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:90%
You're happy now.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.220 align:middle line:90%
You seem happy.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell them
about my spiritual practice

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:90%
or whatever was going on.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.193 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, teach us.

00:40:15.193 --> 00:40:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Show us what you do--

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
my friends who were all punkers,
and they're all tattoo artists,

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and they're all street kids.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.826 align:middle line:84%
>> You must have had a lot
of tattoo artist friends.

00:40:23.826 --> 00:40:26.166 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.012 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I started offering
little classes for my friends

00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:90%
like, OK, let's sit together.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.762 align:middle line:84%
Let's just sit
together and be quiet.

00:40:33.762 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's not do anything,
just watch our breath.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of years
ago, I got invited

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to teach meditation in
the same juvenile hall

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.198 align:middle line:90%
where I had started.

00:40:46.198 --> 00:40:49.072 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:55.778 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.778 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I don't even know
what else there is to say.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:84%
My life has become this
spiritual practice.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's what's important to me.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the only game
in town, really.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of other stuff.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I still stay involved in the
scenes that I have come out of.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I still have a lot of the
same friends that aren't

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:90%
very interested in what I do.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And the natural expression of
going inward is going outward

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what Ocean
has been talking about,

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
as of being of service,
of using our life's energy

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:90%
to benefit others.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And what that looks
like for Ocean

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is all of this wonderful
action in environmental stuff,

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and Gotham doing
his books and stuff.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I go into
the institutions,

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and I teach meditation to kids.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions
that came up earlier--

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't have any
answers about there's

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.472 align:middle line:84%
all these questions
about parenting.

00:41:59.472 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I have no-- you know, I have
no idea about parenting.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a parent.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that I
have seen that seems useful

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is that, often-- and
it was true for me too.

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't hear it really
from my parents so much.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hear.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:84%
My parents were spiritual,
but I couldn't really

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:90%
hear it from them.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I had to kind of come to
it on my own on some level.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that seems very useful

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and one of the places where I'm
putting a lot of my energy into

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is mentoring, is having
people in our lives

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:90%
that maybe aren't our--

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:84%
are in relationship with
that aren't our parents that

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:84%
are modeling that,
that can be teachers,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:90%
that can be friends to us.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That's been extremely
helpful to me and a role

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.030 align:middle line:84%
that now I get to play
quite often for teens

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
in many different roles.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We've created rites
of passage groups

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:84%
with kind of a spiritual basis,
just being spiritual mentors,

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:84%
just being somebody in
young people's lives

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that is standing for going
inward, that is standing

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.320 align:middle line:84%
for practicing stopping,
that isn't spending all

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of their time being busy,
that has a meditation

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.870 align:middle line:84%
practice, or a yoga
practice, or whatever.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the specifics
of what you do is important

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:84%
but that you do something,
that you do have a practice,

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and you model that.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that I
have much more to say,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.090 align:middle line:84%
but that it's just really
wonderful to be here

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and that my intention in
coming to these things

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.450 align:middle line:90%
is just to be an example.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's like we created
a nonprofit organization

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:10%
to bring awareness
practices into institutions.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.052 align:middle line:10%
And I know that so many
people, and myself included,

00:43:50.052 --> 00:43:51.760 align:middle line:10%
it's like we want to
do all these things,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know how.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And just to inspire
people, just do it.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Like go teach yoga at
a homeless shelter.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Go volunteer at hospice.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Go start a recycling program.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Just go out and use your life's
energy to benefit others.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is a
spiritual practice.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:90%
That in itself is huge.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:22.655 align:middle line:84%
In closing, I would just like
to thank everybody for the work

00:44:22.655 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing on yourselves,
for the work that you're

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:84%
doing in the world, and
encourage you to do more.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean,
I'll say something.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to close, and
I'm into telling stories.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And one experience
I had specifically,

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:10%
which to me has sort of become
a larger message, I was--

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and if anyone's ever been
to India or Pakistan,

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.400 align:middle line:10%
they know that what some of
the public buses look like.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They're these very old,
rickety looking things.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But there are
millions, literally

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.660 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of people
hanging on to these buses

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:90%
from every conceivable angle.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to be one of them.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:90%
So I tried.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And I grabbed on.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And literally, the
buses sort of lean over,

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're barely
above the ground.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And I grabbed on.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And we had to go maybe
on a five-minute ride.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself gradually
losing grip, losing grip.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And nobody-- I mean, the bus
driver, the last thing he cares

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:84%
about or even is aware
of is if somebody

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.920 align:middle line:90%
is going to fall under the bus.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself
slipping slowly.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was almost to the point
where I was going to slip off.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I was, in fact, looking for a
place to fall off conveniently.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, just
almost as I let go, somewhere

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
from this mass of
humanity inside,

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:84%
somebody grabbed my
wrist, and held me,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and held me until we stopped.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we stopped, and 100,000
people poured off the bus,

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and I never even knew who the
guy was who had grabbed me

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.840 align:middle line:90%
and sort of held me on.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.183 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of
searched, but I knew

00:46:07.183 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
find the person.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about it.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even think about
it until just now as everybody's

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:84%
been sharing their stories
and talking about it.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that was
like the real message.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're trying
to do is reach out a hand.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And you brought it up, and they
were talking about listening.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what we can do.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:90%
We can really reach out.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody in this
room went out and reached out

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in whatever way they can in
whichever form they do it,

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:90%
we can make a change.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I hope and I
know, just listening--

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've known these
guys for less than 10 hours.

00:46:44.065 --> 00:46:45.987 align:middle line:90%
But it's pretty amazing.

00:46:45.987 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm inspired, and I can
see that they're reaching out.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel
privileged to be here.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.480 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for having me.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.680 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We thank you very much.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:25.440 align:middle line:90%
