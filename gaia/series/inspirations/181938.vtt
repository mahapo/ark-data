>>LISA GARR: Did you know
love is actually a choice you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:90%
can make over and over again?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not something that you get.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It's something that you choose.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:10%
These are the words of my guest
today, Dr. Barbara DeAngelis,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:10%
author of over 16
bestselling books that have

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:10%
sold over 10 million copies.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:10%
Barbara's latest book,
"The Choice for Love,"

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
is written for today's
unsettling times,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:10%
where we're each called
to become a living remedy,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:10%
as Barbara says, not to fall
in love but to rise in love.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: Thank you.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
have the opportunity

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to rise in love with you.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I love that phrase,
"to rise in love."

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It really calls
to today's times.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about loving.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an action of love.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DE ANGELIS: You know,
I've written a lot of books,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:10%
but a few years
ago, I was called

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
to rise in understanding why
right now, more than ever,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:10%
understanding our
relationship to love,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:10%
not who's in our life,
not who's loving us,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:10%
but our relationship to
love itself as an energy,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:10%
as the source energy
is so crucial.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The ways we're
blocking it, the ways

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
we allow it to flow and to
understand that we are always

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
making a difference
vibrationally in how

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.977 align:middle line:84%
we are contributing
to the world,

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
or how we're putting
out things that are not

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
positive to the world because of
our own relationship with love,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
which is not in action.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:10%
It's not even about
a relationship.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:10%
It's that primal source energy.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:10%
It's this light-drenched
field of vibration

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:10%
that so many mystics
talk about as the source.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the most
important relationship we have.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The relationship
with that energy,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
how we use it, how we choose
it, and the whole premise of it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't have to
wait for love to choose us.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to wait till
something does something

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:90%
to make us feel love.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We are always, actually,
in love, even if we're not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:90%
feeling it in that state.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.485 align:middle line:84%
And knowing how to choose it,
our life can completely change,

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's so
exciting about it.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.068 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's different.

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I love you're reframing
love because it needs to be.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, the old phrase
in the spiritual community,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
"you can't love anyone else
unless you love yourself

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:90%
first."

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
to be said for that,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
but I think that we've
got to turn that up.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.605 align:middle line:10%
>>DE ANGELIS: That's
a superficial way of--

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:10%
it's the beginning
of an understanding,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:10%
but it's not actually accurate.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't experience the
love other people give you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
if you're not already
experiencing your own love.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
loving yourself

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
because people think of that
and they say, you're right.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I should get more pedicures.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.257 align:middle line:90%
I should get a massage.

00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I need to do affirmations.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
But love is a
vibrational reality.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine it
as this ocean inside of us,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and if we have blocked
our connection to it,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
if we're not allowing it to
flow out, if we have conditions,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
old baggage, et cetera, that
are not allowing us to feel it,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:84%
if we're frozen in that ocean
of love and so we can't feel it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not moving.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
You can tell yourself all you
want I should love myself more,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.617 align:middle line:84%
but when you tap into
that, that love rises up.

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the great things,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.992 align:middle line:84%
and I think you'll like
this, that I always

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
tell people is when
you say, I'm in love.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And you meet somebody and
you say, oh, my god, I

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:90%
fell in love.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Did the person pour
gallons of love into you?

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Did they give you like a shot?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Where did that love come from?

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The exchange, right?

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: No.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:90%
It comes from within you.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It rose up.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Because of things that
person said or did,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:84%
you gave yourself
permission to feel it.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%
It's your own love.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
We're always only
feeling our own love.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.617 align:middle line:10%
It's no one else's.

00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, you find out

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
something horrible
about that person.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, you say,
I don't feel any love.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Did that person
take away the love?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Did they come at night
and siphon it off

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:90%
because you broke up?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:90%
We choose to feel it.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:90%
We choose not to feel it.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.463 align:middle line:84%
We choose to feel it or
not with our own partner.

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
One day, somebody we
love does something

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
we don't like, suddenly,
we feel shut off.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Nothing changed.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.178 align:middle line:90%
We've made choices.

00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So the whole premise
of the choice for love

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is that every day, we
are making thousands

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of choices about ourself,
about other people.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And to choose to connect
with that, to find it,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to clear out the pathway
so you can find it,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring it forth in
your life can completely

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
change how you live.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And it is what the world needs.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
It is the way we can
change the world,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and it's what we can do now.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to wait for
even to have a partner,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to have things go right,
to do things that we're

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:90%
happy with about ourself.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, every day, we're
going up, down, up, down

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:90%
in how we feel.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
That love is always
available, and when

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to tap into
it, everything changes.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's that ocean.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I love that idea of
that ocean of self-love.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It ebbs and flows, but it's
not dependent on another person

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
loving us.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.728 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: You
know, the way you

00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
can think about it
is if we imagine--

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is, again, what
all real wisdom talks about

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is that we are love.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Love is God, et cetera.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
If we have that source,
and you know this

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
just from seeing a baby,
when a baby's born,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
they know they are pure love.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:90%
They are drenched in love.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as, for
instance, a baby who says,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not into intimacy
or I need my space.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't like physical affection.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we get older, people
say that's just the way I am.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not the way we were.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But that love light
is in a child's eyes,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.912 align:middle line:90%
and that is who we are.

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And then stuff covers it
up, which we can talk about,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if there's this
ocean inside of us of love

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:90%
as the prime source energy.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes along and
they're like the wind.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
They make a wave, and
our love rises up.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Our own love rises up and waves.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Something else happens, no wind.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Our love calms down.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's always your own love.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how much are
you allowing that wind to flow?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if the
wind comes and there's

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
a frozen ocean or frozen
lake, there's no waves.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.967 align:middle line:84%
And so you think how come,
I used to be so loving,

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and now I don't feel much?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm numb.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm shut off.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
The love is still there.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just frozen.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be defrosted.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what if
you're in a relationship,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and the person says, I
don't love you anymore.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you respond to
that because it hurts?

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Of course it
hurts, but being in pain,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
having regret,
being angry, feeling

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
disappointed have nothing
to do with feeling love.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So many times in our
life, and all of us

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this
from the time we first

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:90%
get hurt as a child.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.472 align:middle line:84%
Something happens,
someone disappoints us,

00:07:29.472 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
someone hurts us
or doesn't love us

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the way we think they should,
and we end up, in a sense,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
freezing a piece of
our heart, freezing

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:90%
a piece of our emotions.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a block of ice.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Something else happens, and
there's another block of ice.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Bit by bit, block
by block, we end up

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
with frozen ice walls
around our heart.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Our love can't get out,
other people's can't get in.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's there just like
water doesn't disappear.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
H2O doesn't disappear when
it's in the form of ice.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the same substance,
but it needs to melt.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.762 align:middle line:84%
Love can take the form
of resistance, of anger,

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:90%
of being shut off, et cetera.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So choosing to love, meaning
to feel the love, even

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
when we're hurt, even
when we're disappointed,

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great
spiritual choices.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.368 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you choose
to let somebody hurt

00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
you or you even
stay with someone,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:84%
but to sacrifice
our own lovingness,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.185 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
watching have done that.

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
They can go, you know what?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Ever since this happened,
I've been afraid to love again

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But that love is
what nourishes us.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Love in the form
of our heart energy

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:90%
is the form of relationship.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
In the form of energy up
here, it's creativity.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:90%
That source makes us juicy.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It makes us flow in life.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
need to go through what

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I call the big melt
because they've

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.125 align:middle line:84%
gotten crusty and
frozen over the years.

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's a lot
also that it seems like we're

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:90%
constantly defending love.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of outside
influences and disturbances

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and disruption.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
For example,
forgiveness-- somebody

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
has done something
horrible or there's

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
injustices in the
world, and that love

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.058 align:middle line:90%
does get chipped away at.

00:09:11.058 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: But the love
doesn't get chipped away at,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:90%
our access to it does.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with, as you know,
just hundreds of thousands

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:90%
of people over the years.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have somebody come
in to a workshop or a seminar,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:90%
and they're shut off.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:90%
They're angry.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
They're bitter, et cetera.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And in 10 minutes,
in a half hour,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
just having them do certain
things, they're crying.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
They're opening up.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:10%
They're melting.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:10%
They say, I thought I was dead.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:90%
The love isn't chipped away at.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We have put a "do not
disturb sign" on our heart.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:90%
We're not accessing it.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
cutting off from that,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:84%
we're cutting off from
the same things we want--

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:84%
power, energy, charisma,
radiance, et cetera.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It is this amazing elixir.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So the choice for love is
really about knowing that we

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:90%
are always making choices.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And most people every
day are doing the--

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
they're making
choices for not love.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They're making the
choice for judgment.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They're making a
choice for anger.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.335 align:middle line:84%
They're making a
choice for retaliation.

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They're making a
choice for punishment.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
They're making a choice
for divisiveness,

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
which we can see in
the world and where

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:90%
that's taking everything.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that
you go and embrace somebody

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:90%
who's trying to hurt you.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize
that we are making

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
personal choices every day about
ourselves and about others that

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
are either connecting us,
connecting our circuitry

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
so that all our circuits
are on, or we're pulling out

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
our circuitry so
that we're operating

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
with a very small
amount of life force,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.792 align:middle line:84%
and then that
creates other issues.

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
What do we have to do
to fill ourself up,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting because
those choices of judgment

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and hate and those
choices are less

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable than being in that
vulnerable state of love.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Love, it is a vulnerable state.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Hate is one way, and it is a
closed off, disconnected state.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Something
I write about and teach

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot about that I think
a lot about these days

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
is what I call the
shift from me to we.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
If you look at everything going
on in the world that is evil,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
it comes from me and
then there's an other.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.025 align:middle line:90%
You are an other.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:90%
You look different.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
You love differently.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Your skin is different.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:90%
You worship differently.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
You are not me, therefore,
I can cause you harm.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I don't care
what happens to you.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
We consciousness,
which is, again,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
what great mystics talk
about, we conscious

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.073 align:middle line:84%
is why great yogis came
down from the mountains

00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and said it's not enough
that I'm enlightened.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to
get enlightened.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We consciousness is
when you experience

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
or anyone experiences
something wonderful,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
a great new restaurant, and
you want to call your friend.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.755 align:middle line:84%
You don't just go, I'm so
happy that I liked that.

00:11:57.755 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You want to share it.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
We consciousness
is what family is.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We conscious is what a
relationship should be.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And we consciousness is
what conscious society is.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:90%
It's OK that I'm not suffering.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
They're suffering,
so it doesn't matter.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
That's, in the living
form, what compassion is.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So the shift from me
to we is the shift

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:84%
that I invite everyone
to really think about.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, if
somebody's part of you,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:90%
you cannot harm them.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So the more we grow in that,
the more we come from love,

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the more we choose
love, it really

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
will shift how we
experience the world.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.265 align:middle line:84%
And we can each
make a difference,

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
even though we can't
change everything.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But we can make that shift,
and it will absolutely

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:90%
uplift our environment.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.843 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, something
you've written about

00:12:45.843 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:90%
is that cosmic grief.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
When there's so many things that
are happening to the world, not

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
just interpersonally,
but to the world,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
we get into that
place of apathy.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't fix this.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And then my heart bleeds
for the people that

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
are starving, for the
environment that's

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
being thrashed, and
it does send you

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.713 align:middle line:84%
into a place of hopelessness,
and there is no love there.

00:13:09.713 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: It should send
us into a place of compassion

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's conscious,
anyone who's watching this,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
which is the great light
workers of the world,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
we cannot afford to
shut off and cut off.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, when I was
teaching a seminar and somebody

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
said I'm a very
spiritual person.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very intuitive person.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I can't handle what's happening
in the world, and I decided--

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and it was right after a recent
election, she said, I just,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm staying out of it.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said there is no out.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:90%
There is no out.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:90%
We're all in.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
If you understand anything
about spirituality

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of life, where is the out?

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:90%
We are all in.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:90%
We're vibrationally connected.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:90%
We're connected by our breath.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:84%
We're connected
electromagnetically.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
All the time, we're
each affecting people.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.543 align:middle line:84%
Every thought we have,
moving through life,

00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:90%
everything that's happening.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether people know that or not,
we're vibrating all the time.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We're in a vibrational
big stew pot.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So there is no out.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So the decision I'm going
to just stay out of it

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
is a decision to cut off,
shut off, go numb, not care.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And that energy creates
hopelessness for other people,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.943 align:middle line:84%
So you can have-- so
then what do we do?

00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:90%
And I talk about this.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.207 align:middle line:84%
You can have grief and
compassion at the same time.

00:14:32.207 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you can?

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: See,
my second chapter

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.655 align:middle line:84%
is about feelings and people
not understanding emotion.

00:14:38.655 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
People think they
have to choose,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
like in a Chinese
restaurant, column A, B, C.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm either angry, or
I'm going to be loving.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
You can be angry and
loving at the same time.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
You can say I am not
happy with what you did.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I still love you.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I can feel compassion
for everything

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and then be furious
at other things.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I can feel scared
about what's happening,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and I can also hold love.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
For ourselves, as
well, I can say

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I am scared about something.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not happy with what I did,
but I can hold love for myself.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
This is such an
enlightened concept.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.577 align:middle line:90%
It's the real concept.

00:15:13.577 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens as we grow
in more and more awakening,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hold a lot of
different feeling at once.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to thinking, since
I'm so upset with that person,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:90%
then I can't care anymore.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
It's totally wrong.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Those emotions are all there.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's ever had a
child knows that, right?

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You can say I am furious
at what my child did.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not shutting off.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I adore you.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is how we need to
learn to be with everybody

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and with ourselves.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that relationship,
though, with a child

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You unconditionally
love that child

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because you're
responsible for it.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You nurture this child,
and you allow this child

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.002 align:middle line:90%
to grow up in the world.

00:15:55.002 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't do that with
some of the leaders that

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:90%
are causing all this divisive.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And I'm
not saying that you're

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.612 align:middle line:90%
loving them specifically.

00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
You asked me about the
grief and the cosmic grief.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are suffering
from a sense of cosmic grief

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:90%
of why is the world this way?

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that's
creating more of that?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I think
that that is a question--

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the
divine discomfort.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I think every seeker
has come into the world

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and one of their
first experiences

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:90%
was why are things this way?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't everybody happy?

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Why can't people
love each other?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I remember these
sacred questions

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
when I was very young,
wondering where was I?

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Was I sent to the wrong planet?

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
How many times do people
think who are these people?

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
This is not the planet
I'm supposed to be on.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, it is the
planet we're supposed to be on.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We were assigned to be on
this planet to shift it,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to help be part of
the Great Awakening

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and not say I'm out of here.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We are all living
ambassadors, especially

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
people who are conscious, who
are watching Gaia, who are

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:90%
doing something for themselves.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
This is the time that we
need to step up and be

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
on the front lines and not go,
I just want to move to Hawaii.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go to Costa Rica.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is no
escape right now.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And
there is no out.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, there isn't.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And there's
not supposed to be.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is why,
now more than ever,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I always say to seekers we
need to heal more deeply,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
love more fully, clear our
issues more thoroughly,

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:90%
not say I did enough of it.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.423 align:middle line:90%
We need to go all the way now.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
reasons I wrote this book.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
reasons I've been

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach more, do more,
offer more online courses.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.855 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:37.655 align:middle line:90%
We are needed.

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's the time we
have prepared for.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we can feel
that feeling of I

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:90%
just want to recede back.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That is not our
higher self talking.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was thinking
about that the other day.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Where can you go?

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Where can you get away from
the wildfires, the hurricanes,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
the mass shootings?

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: You go to
the sanctuary of the heart.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you have to.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.472 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And
in the heart, there

00:17:58.472 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:84%
is enough love, enough
compassion, enough courage,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
enough emotional
courage, enough strength

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say how
can I bring the highest

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.438 align:middle line:90%
love to this situation?

00:18:08.438 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And these are a lot
of the techniques

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that I teach that are
so important right now.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
How do I bring love
to this situation?

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
How do I see this
situation with more love?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
What choice am I
making right now?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Am I making a choice
for my highest?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Am I making a choice
not for my highest?

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Is there a more enlightened
choice I can make?

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Choice by choice, we can
navigate through every day,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
every situation, et cetera.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.642 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we're
not feeling things.

00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
we're not stressed.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we're
not unhappy with what's

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:90%
happening in the world.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But we are choosing the
highest choice for ourself.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
That highest choice will radiate
out to others, et cetera.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But the choice to not feel,
to not care, to move away,

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and to hide is not an option.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It's an option,
but it should not

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
be an option in anyone
who considers himself,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
saying all those people
are screwing up the world

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and because of that,
I want to pull away.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.543 align:middle line:84%
You are now one of
those people, you see?

00:19:09.543 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
to make a difference?

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.085 align:middle line:90%
You can do something.

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And making a difference is
not about starting a movement,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
having a TV show,
writing a book.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Choice by choice, we are all
making a difference everyday

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
by what we're vibrating out.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Are we contributing to the
vibration of love, compassion,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:90%
clarity?

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Are we contributing to the
vibration of hate, anger, et

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
We are all changing the
world every single second.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not just a song.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.997 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:19:35.997 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is how
we make a choice I

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
want you to take a look here
at Barbara's video where

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
she's talking about choice
and that's what love is.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:10%
>>DE ANGELIS: When you think
of your physical heart,

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:10%
you know that it's a muscle
responsible for pumping blood

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:10%
through your body and
keeping you alive.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
However, did you
know your true heart

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:90%
is so much more than that?

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-physical,
metaphysical heart.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
This inner heart is the seat
of that ultimate reality.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It serves as the entry
point for the soul

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
from the divine,
unlimited source energy

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
into your physical
individuality and form.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the home from which all
the ripples of who you are

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
originate.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual heart is
the vibrational space

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
spoken about by mystics and
referenced in ancient writings.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the connecting link
between heaven and Earth

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and between the
universal consciousness

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and your consciousness.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It's nature.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It's pure love.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So what about those people,
and me, I've done this,

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
go to a personal
development workshop.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Three days, love fest.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Get these epiphanies.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: Instant high.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Come back into my life, and
then one thing after the next

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
after the next puts me
back into my old patterns.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I get over-scheduled.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I get pulled in too
many directions,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and I'm back to where I started.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I can
explain this perfectly.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things
that I'm known for is

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and I'm honored to be able
to do this in my life,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is teaching what I call
practical spirituality.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this for 50
years now, believe it or not.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: 50.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I started my spiritual
path when I was 18.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
68 any second now.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been doing
this for a long time.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And our idea of what
the spiritual path

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
should look like for most people
is kindergarten spirituality.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the misunderstanding.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
If I just do this
and do that, I'll

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
get happier and
happier every day.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll always get
support of nature.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
That's not how we learn
our soul curriculum.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We each have a social curriculum
that we need to learn.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about going to an event

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
or it could be watching a
show or taking a course,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and yes, it's designed
to raise your vibration.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
It does raise your
vibration temporarily.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But practical
spirituality is the how.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
What did I do at that
thing that allowed

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:90%
me to vibrate at my highest?

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to
do when I come home?

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:90%
We need techniques.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:90%
We need tools.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not magical thinking.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not like going
spiritual shopping

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.167 align:middle line:90%
or taking a spiritual shower.

00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's how a lot
of people think--

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying you--

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:90%
where we think, I did that.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
I did that thing.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I saw that guru.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And so didn't that do it?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:90%
You know, I did it to me.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't do it.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of that
person or that teacher

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:84%
or that workshop, you
experience, not them,

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
your highest.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
The idea of that is that you
say, wow, I feel peaceful.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I feel so tuned in.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I feel more compassionate.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
This is my highest
self, revealing herself,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.640 align:middle line:84%
itself to me, but I don't
always live this way.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And the point of it is for
you to love that feeling,

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to want that feeling, and
then to go back into your life

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and make the choices
and do the things that

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
get you to that place
you're living it,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:90%
not just visiting it.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.803 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is we think
that something magical should

00:23:20.803 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
happen, and we
should feel better.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when
we have those things,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we go to those events or we
see a show or whatever it is,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
the universe will
deliberately say, OK, now,

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:90%
let's ground this.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And we will suddenly
find that we go back,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and we are challenged.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We have one thing after
another happening,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and we say, I felt great, and
then all this stuff happened,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and it got lost.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff
happened to show you

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
how you lose your
connection with your center,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:90%
so that you can then say, whoa.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
What choice did I make?

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:90%
What did I indulge in instead?

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.353 align:middle line:90%
Look at how I went and shut off.

00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:00.062 align:middle line:84%
Look at how instead
of dealing with this,

00:24:00.062 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I drank five glasses of wine
because I said I was stressed.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
What if I had done
something different?

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:90%
And we learn to rise up.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
teachings I have,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and I can give to
everybody now--

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
when anything's happening
to you from somebody else,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
something that happens that is
a disappointment, a challenge,

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying, what's
happening to me because that's

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:90%
what we do.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to me today?

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:90%
My husband was in a bad mood.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:90%
My kid did this.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
My secretary did-- the
spiritual question of awakening

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening in me?

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:90%
What's happening in me?

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not what's
happening in them

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%
that made them do that.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you mean
in me as a reaction

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:90%
to what's happening out there?

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: What's
happening in me?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I am shutting off
from my husband

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't appreciate
me enough this morning.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I am deciding to just let
go of something that's

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
hard because I'm upset that
somebody didn't help me more.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:90%
What am I choosing?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
me is the question

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.828 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual responsibility
versus what's happening to me?

00:25:08.828 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
What's happening to me is
a question of a victim.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a question of anger.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a question of blame.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The minute you say
what's happening in me?

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Guess which part of you
is asking that question?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The victim.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: No, your highest.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:19.606 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:25:19.606 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:90%
In me, yeah.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: Your highest.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And it will call upon
your knowingness.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And your knowingness says,
well, and at first, you

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
might say nothing's
happening in me.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:90%
It's their fault.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask again,
what's happening in me?

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:90%
I've chosen to push away.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen to feel
sorry for myself.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen to find
evidence that people

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
aren't there for me.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there a better
choice I can make?

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there a more loving choice?

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
How would I bring love
to this situation?

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And right then,
what's happened, we

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:90%
haven't changed the situation.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
We've shifted our identification
from our limited self, which

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:90%
we all have to our highest.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Every day, everyone
knows we've all

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
had moments when we're
so high, so wonderful.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:90%
We're happy.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:90%
We're in the mountains.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
We're meditating.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:90%
We're in love.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:90%
We're at a yoga retreat.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
And we go I am it.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm enlightened.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm finally somewhere.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our
lowest moments, right,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:90%
that we hope nobody is--

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
everything in between.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
My point is, it's not an
accident that one moment you

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
feel one way or the other.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
We're making invisible,
silent choices.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
If we can notice the
choices that we've made,

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
that got us there, make
different ones, which

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:90%
is part of what I teach people.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not just deciding we'll
see how today turns out.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not talking about goals.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about intentions.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
positive visualizations.

00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're talking
about accidents.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.712 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I'm
talking about the choices

00:26:45.712 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually--
internal choices that we're

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
making all the time with how we
hold things, how we experience

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:90%
things, and emotional choices.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
choose if there

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is an accident or something
that seems totally external, out

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
of our circumstances, everything
that's out of our control,

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
you can actually say this
is life presenting me

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
with this challenging situation
so I can actually practice

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:90%
what I have just learned.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.080 align:middle line:90%
100%, that's what you're saying?

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.685 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Aren't you
going to have to practice it?

00:27:16.685 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.443 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: You're going
to have to practice it.

00:27:19.443 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
You know if on days
when everything's fine,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
nothing's happening,
everything's going smoothly

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.925 align:middle line:90%
for a while, we can coast.

00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
call upon anything.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
that it's great

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:90%
when horrible things happen.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we look back
and we ask ourselves,

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:84%
in impossible moments, we call
upon the possible resource

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
that we have inside of us.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.612 align:middle line:84%
So that then we say I
have something in me.

00:27:45.612 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Something in me allowed
me to get through this.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Or I brought more love to it
or I brought more compassion

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:90%
or more patience to it.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But every single day,
we make decisions

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
about how we're going
to deal with everything,

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:90%
internal decisions.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.528 align:middle line:84%
All shifting has to be
vibrational from the inside.

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
You can't shift on the outside.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can't we just get
to a place though, Barbara,

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.405 align:middle line:84%
where we could just
coast for a little while?

00:28:08.405 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Is that all right?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: When people
say things to me like,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.673 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.673 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of
personal growth work.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they've taken
one of my workshops

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and someone else's, and say,
I'm taking a break for a while.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I just need to take a break.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I always say you took a
break for so many lifetimes

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you're
here right now.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to--

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all feel that way.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And so yes, we take a day.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:10%
But the truth is, the whole
planet's been taking a break.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe if anybody
is really on a conscious path

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and felt drawn to that
path and felt the call

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to awakening in any way,
whether it's just the last month

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting
to watch Gaia,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it's been for 30
years or 50 years, like me,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that we're
here to take a break.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I think we're here to
help heal what's broken

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and that means what's
broken in ourselves.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Broken meaning what
is disconnected,

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
not what's wrong but what's
disconnected from spirit,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
what's disconnected
from our love, what's

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from each other?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.173 align:middle line:84%
That's what, again, all
spiritual paths talk about.

00:29:16.173 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to think about it
that way, but we have to think

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
but how does that apply to
me, living spirituality?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
meditating, and I was 18.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.115 align:middle line:90%
And it was 1969.

00:29:27.115 --> 00:29:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought all
I have to do is

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
meditate every day and
everything's going to be great.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The right people
will come in my life.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a silly way
of understanding things,

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
but it was like a little kid
thinking magical thinking.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I began
to look around me

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in my 20s at
spiritual communities,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I realized there was,
as a psychologist,

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:84%
there was a lack of
integration, a lack of balance.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And more than ever,
that's what my career

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
has been about to just talk
not just about the what but the

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.936 align:middle line:90%
how.

00:29:56.936 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Because we all would love
to experience everything

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.120 align:middle line:10%
like that, but the how
is really important.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.947 align:middle line:84%
There's mechanics of
spiritual transformation.

00:30:07.947 --> 00:30:09.530 align:middle line:84%
There's actual
mechanics, the same way

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
there are mechanics of healing
our body or anything that

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:16.058 align:middle line:84%
are so important to understand
and to not misunderstand.

00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people, when they're

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:84%
going through a
difficult time or a time

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of questioning, a
time of a lot of challenges,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:90%
say what am I doing wrong?

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:10%
All my work that
I've done on myself

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:10%
obviously isn't working because
x, y, or z is happening.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the worst things
that we can do to ourselves.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the big mistakes we
make on the spiritual path

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
is misunderstanding
what's happening.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And asking
what we're doing wrong?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Instead
of understanding

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening?

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:90%
What is this lesson?

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Why am I learning
this right now?

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed to be
calling on and thinking

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
that if we're going
through difficult times,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:90%
it means we have made a mistake.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I gave a lecture last--

00:30:59.130 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does?

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It does?

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: No, of
course it doesn't.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it doesn't.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: But that's
what a lot of people do.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
They think but if I've
been doing x, y, and z,

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't everything be fine?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way it works.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:90%
We'd love it to.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The little kid in us would
like to think that's the case,

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the case.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a world
with a lot of ignorance.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not an enlightened
planet, and our job

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is to I always say, the only
goal I think everyone should

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
really have is today,
I'm going to live

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:84%
as the most awakened,
loving person I can be.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:90%
We can make lists.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:90%
We can make to-do lists.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally into lists.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm very focused, et cetera.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing we
can accomplish every day

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is that today, I'm going to
live as the most awakened,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:90%
loving human being I can be.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stay awake.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be more awake
on the way it's done.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pay attention.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I'm going
to course correct,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and maybe today will be a
good day at work or not.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe today will be a calm
day in my house or not,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.752 align:middle line:90%
but I can make that choice.

00:32:01.752 --> 00:32:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're turning it up.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You're really making
this an urgent sense

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.037 align:middle line:90%
of this choice for love.

00:32:07.037 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: But
what's the opposite?

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, I am not going to
live as the most awakened

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
conscious person I can be?

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.218 align:middle line:90%
Not even going back to sleep.

00:32:14.218 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:90%
What about in the middle?

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to be kind
of conscious, you know?

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to be
loving when I want to.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Why would we think that?

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I like to do as
a very transformational teacher

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:84%
is to call people to
what are you doing

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:90%
if you're making that choice?

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're saying I'm not going
to be the most loving, the most

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:90%
awake.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just kind of.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I'm going to do it
with the people who deserve it.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
This person, I'm a little
pissed off at, so I'll wait.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
What choice are we making
in then moment, you know?

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.743 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's true I want
you to take a look here

00:32:46.743 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:84%
at Barbara talking
about her sense

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:90%
of practical spirituality.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Practical
spirituality--

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.358 align:middle line:84%
it's one thing to sit and
think I know I'm divine,

00:32:56.358 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and the world's full of angels.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But what do you do when
someone's driving you crazy,

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:02.627 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:02.627 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you
leave the conference

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
or open your eyes from prayer
meditation and face your life?

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Practical spirituality--
how do you apply it?

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you actually
get even more frustrated,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and then it becomes
two worlds, you know?

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything's fine
when my eyes are closed.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:84%
When my eyes are open,
everything's horrible.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.685 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Or you go away for
a week to a retreat.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this was heaven.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.010 align:middle line:90%
If I could only live here.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You can live there.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.148 align:middle line:90%
You can live there.

00:33:31.148 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
If you understand the inner
conditions for creating it,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:84%
you should live there but
not away from everything,

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:90%
So here's the thing--

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.960 align:middle line:84%
we all have our highest self,
our most enlightened moments,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.730 align:middle line:90%
our most loving moments, right?

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
You all can think
of moments when

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
you were in your highest,
hopefully, recently.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It could be a second.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It could be compassion
with a friend.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be, again, in
meditation or prayer,

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:90%
going to church.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:90%
It could be helping somebody.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
You go this is me.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I feel so good right.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my highest.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:90%
I am a wonderful being.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:08.999 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm divine.

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we all have the
opposite, our lowest moments.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
We lose it, where
we're off balance.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Where our most unattractive
human parts come out, right?

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Even if no one sees
them, we feel them.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
everything in between.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
On any given day, where would
you like to be on the scale?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.340 align:middle line:90%
At the highest.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
So then the question
is why, why?

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
If I can feel it
for five minutes,

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:90%
why can't I maintain it?

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You ask a great
question at the end there.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
If I can feel it for 10
minutes, why doesn't that last?

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I maintain it?

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I want
to get into the mechanics.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: That's
I been talking about.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the mechanics of this--

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the
mechanics of how to maintain

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that space, Barbara?

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what are some of
the practical mechanics on how

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:90%
to maintain it.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: The first thing
is to notice when we're not

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.190 align:middle line:84%
maintaining it because this
is where a lot of people

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:90%
glaze over.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
enough consciousness

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.860 align:middle line:84%
about what we're doing,
why we're doing it,

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:90%
how we're feeling.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So the things I said
before, for instance,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.055 align:middle line:84%
about noticing what choice
am I making right now.

00:35:23.055 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We think we're making
choices like what

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.133 align:middle line:90%
we're going to eat that day.

00:35:26.133 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to finish
this thing or not.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Who do I call?

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But the emotional and
consciousness choices

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.040 align:middle line:84%
we're making are really
determining our day.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So why can't I
maintain it goes back

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to that idea of I went to
this great meditation retreat

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and I came back, and
why can't I maintain it?

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And you see, that's a complaint
when most people say it.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I maintain it?

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it happening?

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I?

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Asking it as a real question--

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:90%
why can't I maintain it?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about why.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.830 align:middle line:90%
What's underneath this?

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
What do I not do?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
How am I allowing myself
to slide into this or that?

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.498 align:middle line:90%
What is my secret rulebook?

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll act enlightened
and loving, et cetera,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
unless these things happen,
and then I'm allowed

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to be pissed off, et cetera.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.150 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of stuff
that goes on inside of people,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and there's techniques that
we can use and should use.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.063 align:middle line:84%
And the simplest thing
is that what choice

00:36:21.063 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:90%
am I making right now?

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we're feeling
upset, we're irritated,

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:84%
we're depressed-- what
choice am I making?

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
To actually
understand that we're

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:84%
making so many choices
intellectually,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:84%
mentally, spiritually,
and emotionally every day.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we
can't maintain it

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is not that we
can't maintain it.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.328 align:middle line:90%
It's that we don't maintain it.

00:36:44.328 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We choose
not to maintain it,

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.787 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And there's tons
of old emotional programming,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
emotional baggage that, to me,
it's essential as a human being

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to learn about, find somebody
who can help you unravel those

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:90%
things because our brain is--

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
many of us have
software in our brain

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that is so outdated
that it is back to

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
from when we were five
years old, 10 years old.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how we got
wired at the time.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I talk a lot about this
in "The Choice for Love."

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're literally having
emotional flashbacks

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Somebody doesn't
particularly get

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that excited about
something we said,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:90%
we're not even in present time.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Something in our
brain goes right back.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Unconsciously,
we're flashing back

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to our mother, our
father, our ex-husband,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and then we suddenly
get a little sarcastic

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.910 align:middle line:90%
with that person.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:90%
The entire event happens.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't even realize
it just went on.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We were literally
hallucinating backwards.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So all this stuff
is so important.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of really
great techniques

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to help people figure
out where we're

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.120 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the emotional
past, and how it's actually

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:90%
affecting everything.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I always say we see the world
through the eyes of our issues.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We think we're seeing clearly,
but we're not seeing clearly.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing through
our programming.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't
operate your computer

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and not upgrade it or
update the software.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.958 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us just
haven't even thought of it.

00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way I am.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Our updates usually
make everything better.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: We need to update
our emotional and intellectual

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and mental software.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.777 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do.

00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I do it for people all the time.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we look back
and we just are in shock.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I walked
around telling myself

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.730 align:middle line:90%
that story about that thing.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was totally not
what was happening.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you shift
to a different dimension.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a question
about the chapter

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.483 align:middle line:84%
in the book about gateways
for impossible times.

00:38:37.483 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You talk about--
first of all, why

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
do you call it a gateway
for impossible times?

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's a chapter in the book.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I think it's
in impossible journeys, yes,

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:90%
which everyone has had.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.787 align:middle line:84%
People are having them
right now as they watch.

00:38:51.787 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Impossible times are the
times that we're thinking

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:90%
why did this happen to me?

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't deal with this.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.977 align:middle line:90%
I want it to just go away.

00:39:00.977 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I want it to stop.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: I use the word--

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:90%
you just said it.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I want it to stop.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a shift
that's so important,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's not intuitive, when
we are battling something.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:90%
When we're saying I hate this.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I want it to go away.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I hate that I'm doing this.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:90%
I hate that this is happening.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Every day we say
that to ourselves we

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:84%
are going to stay stuck in
it because it is happening.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But there are, and I call
them gateways, doorways, ways

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:34.220 align:middle line:84%
of moving into it that will
shift us, that will open us,

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that will begin to heal
us, that will allow us

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to access parts of us
that we don't know about,

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that will call in different
kinds of energies.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But we feel like we just
want to smash whatever it is.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I have a friend--

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm just recalling a friend
going through cancer.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And she just wants
it to be done.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.060 align:middle line:90%
She wants to be over it.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Every day is the chemo.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Every day is the radiation.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:84%
She can't just
smash through that.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that
she can find a gateway

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and go into it from a
different perspective?

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: It's the only
way to move through things

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because battling
something says I hate you.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be gone.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can want
something to be over.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
You can want to get
through a difficult time.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.918 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually
navigate your way through it.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to be able to
have compassion for yourself,

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.090 align:middle line:90%
compassion for other things.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
mechanics of navigating

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.040 align:middle line:90%
through difficult things.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a great
technique in the book

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that I've used in my
past in difficult times.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things we do when we're

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:84%
going through difficult
times is it feels like it's

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:90%
going to last forever, right?

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:90%
We're so caught up in that.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So the first question in the
four questions of healing

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.515 align:middle line:84%
I have is, can I do
this for one more day?

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One more day.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.265 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Can I do
this for one more day?

00:40:53.265 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:84%
If it's really intense, can
I do this for one more hour?

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Can I feel the pain of my
husband leaving for one more

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:90%
hour?

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.163 align:middle line:84%
Can I feel my
questioning about what's

00:41:04.163 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
going to happen
to me financially,

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.705 align:middle line:84%
can I just deal with
it for one more hour?

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
What could make this hour
easier or more difficult?

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.335 align:middle line:90%
That's another question.

00:41:14.335 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's easier, maybe,
if I call somebody.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It's easier if I meditate.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's easier-- what could
make it more difficult?

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's several
other questions

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember right
now, but they can help us

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
when we feel that
we just don't want

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.090 align:middle line:90%
to even be present in things.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Being present in
things can pull forth

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.620 align:middle line:84%
what I call soul
accomplishments.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments are
not things on the outside.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not things we're
trying to control, manage,

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:90%
have mastery over.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.637 align:middle line:84%
They're things that
happen on the inside,

00:41:44.637 --> 00:41:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're really the
great accomplishments

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:90%
that stay with us.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They're the only things
that really stay with us.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So a soul
accomplishment could be

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't shut off even when
my father was having surgery.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't shut off even when
somebody really hurt me,

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and I felt the grief.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I allowed it
to open my heart.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments
are what really

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:84%
carves us, what
allows us to blossom,

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.865 align:middle line:84%
what allows us to ground
ourselves in our awakening.

00:42:15.865 --> 00:42:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's having a
soul accomplishment

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.580 align:middle line:84%
right now because they're
watching the show.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
watching the show.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.648 align:middle line:84%
You said you wrote these down,
and you put them everywhere,

00:42:22.648 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
on your dashboard, on
your mirror, places

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
where when you get
stuck, you can just

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:84%
be reminded by these
little external influences.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.802 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And
it's the same thing

00:42:31.802 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
with the questions
that I talk about,

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:90%
the choice for love questions.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:90%
What's happening in me?

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.167 align:middle line:90%
What am I choosing this moment?

00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
How can I bring more
love to this situation?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Is there more?

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's so great to write
these things down,

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to have them there, to have
cheat sheets, et cetera.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm very big on techniques.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You said something very
kind to me before about

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:84%
how I have things bold
and in boxes in the book.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: It's
very important.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grounded.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very
inspirational teacher,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really practical
and really grounded.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So we need to give ammunition
to our highest self

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to have conversation with that
other part of us and not just

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:90%
say it's all going to work out.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to work out
is a useless thing to say.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to work it out in
this moment, the next moment,

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and the next moment.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And step by step,
we stay more awake.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.295 align:middle line:90%
We stay more in love.

00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I usually
highlight books

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.962 align:middle line:84%
and then I fold the pages
and I highlight and so forth.

00:43:25.962 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And you bolded them for me.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:90%
They're really big.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's great because the
reading is growth stimulating.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I read a couple of sentences,
and I had to process them.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But then you bolded
the ones that I--

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: My books are--

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:90%
they're real pilgrimages.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.500 align:middle line:90%
They're vibrational journeys.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a very intentional thing.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for saying that.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They are designed to
do something to people.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I have there's amazing stories
that I hear all the time

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.620 align:middle line:84%
from people about just having
the book, opening to somewhere.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:84%
They're invitations
to your own vibration

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to reveal itself to your
highest self, to reveal it.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:90%
So we all have that.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.550 align:middle line:90%
That is who we are.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.142 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
just forgetfulness.

00:44:13.142 --> 00:44:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You wrote
something that I loved.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it said, we have to have
compassion for our own karma.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.630 align:middle line:90%
That sucks.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:25.438 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: But as I say,
we each have soul curriculum.

00:44:25.438 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I talk a lot about what
our school curriculum is.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:90%
We're all in soul classes.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It could be Abandonment 101,
Where Has Everybody Gone?

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.480 align:middle line:90%
It could be, You're God.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not God.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.153 align:middle line:84%
How to Stop
Controlling Everybody.

00:44:36.153 --> 00:44:37.320 align:middle line:90%
I have a whole list of them.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.310 align:middle line:90%
They're very funny.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, we all are
taking certain karmic courses.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We take them again and
again at the higher levels.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.622 align:middle line:84%
If anyone watching
thinks about this,

00:44:48.622 --> 00:44:50.830 align:middle line:84%
some of the same things
you've had to deal with maybe

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:84%
when you were younger,
you're dealing

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:84%
with it now but in a
more sophisticated way,

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.140 align:middle line:90%
in a higher way.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We each have certain things
that we're here to learn.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what they
are, recognizing

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.312 align:middle line:84%
those, which I help
people figure out,

00:45:03.312 --> 00:45:05.770 align:middle line:84%
is so important because then
when it happens, you don't go,

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You go, yeah, class number four.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's happening with this
girlfriend right now.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Of course, this is happening.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Of course, mistrust.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's happening.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.060 align:middle line:90%
What have I learned?

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:90%
How do I pull on those lessons?

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.090 align:middle line:90%
How do I be at my highest?

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.303 align:middle line:90%
It shifts everything.

00:45:23.303 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I mean.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.360 align:middle line:90%
We all have karma.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
compassion for it.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not always fun.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But when we stop thinking
something's wrong with us,

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:35.470 align:middle line:84%
it's the same thing, because
we have things happening to us.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Then we can move through our
curriculum with a lot of love,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:90%
a lot of--

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.040 align:middle line:90%
but what's the choice?

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
The choice, again, it's
to battle who we are.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It's to battle reality,
and that's the unreal.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I always talk about our
relationship to the real.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We all have impossible times.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But even in there, there
are so many moments

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.130 align:middle line:84%
where we need to look for
evidence of grace and evidence

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:90%
of love and not intellectually.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about saying I know.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude is not a list.

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not an affirmation.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be an
inner experience that

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is so full inside your heart
that you're letting something

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:90%
pierce your heart.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling it.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling that thing
that happened to you.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the
gateway to awakening,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are not
there to be managed.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They're text messages
from her heart.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.970 align:middle line:90%
We need to not delete them.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to follow them and
say where is this coming from?

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.810 align:middle line:90%
What is it supposed to teach me?

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.552 align:middle line:84%
When we understand that
it's not our intellect

00:46:40.552 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
get us enlightened.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It's fully feeling and that
everything we need to learn

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:90%
will rise up in the heart.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.890 align:middle line:90%
This has been my path.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's how I have taken people
in very short periods of time

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.560 align:middle line:90%
into amazing, amazing healing.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The heart, it's the hub
of all sacred places.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
The great Indian sage
Bhagwan Nityananda

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
said, "the heart is the
hub of all sacred places.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Go there and roam."

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to go
there because it's complex.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So I invite everyone
to go there.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:90%
So much is there.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And not just the idea you
should go to your heart.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.173 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually learn how
to access it within minutes.

00:47:20.173 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Figure out what's happening.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Bring that out into the world.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:84%
This is how we become
the people we want to be.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is a
part of your journey,

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.020 align:middle line:84%
as well as sharing it with the
world as a spiritual teacher.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But you've taken people on
beautiful pilgrimages as well.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of pictures
here with you meeting the Dalai

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Lama.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And what was that
experience like?

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I was invited
to a big conference in Canada

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.273 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of very
well-known people.

00:47:46.273 --> 00:47:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've had a
lot of them on the show,

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:52.932 align:middle line:84%
like including Sir Richard
Branson, and blah, blah, blah.

00:47:52.932 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama
was going to be there.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And the person putting
on the conference

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.940 align:middle line:90%
did not know me well.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.837 align:middle line:84%
He invited me through
somebody else.

00:47:59.837 --> 00:48:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that
there was going to be

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.230 align:middle line:84%
a private audience of a lot of
the speakers and the Dalai Lama

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and not me and not
a few other people.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I really had
to contemplate it

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.060 align:middle line:84%
because I've been a
spiritual seeker for--

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:84%
a serious seeker
for a long time.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I've had two spiritual masters.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And I felt sad,
but I thought, I'm

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.050 align:middle line:84%
going to receive the
darshan, the light,

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.190 align:middle line:90%
the radiance of this being.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel grateful to
be in his presence.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I heard from all
these other people,

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.570 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to muscle
in when the reception was.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.993 align:middle line:84%
And the day of the
reception, the Dalai Lama

00:48:30.993 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:90%
was giving his presentation.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I had already given mine.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
in this big crowd

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and certain people had kind
of pushed to the front row.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was back a
few rows because I

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.400 align:middle line:90%
wasn't at the reception group.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama
finished, and I sat there.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I wore something
similar to this.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat all
day, just being

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.620 align:middle line:90%
there to receive his grace.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.610 align:middle line:90%
He finished his talk.

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:57.790 align:middle line:84%
He moved down off the
stage, and all of a sudden,

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.670 align:middle line:84%
he parted the crowd, walked
through the crowd to me.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing
there, and I could

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.640 align:middle line:84%
feel that my love
and my reverence

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.050 align:middle line:90%
had been such a beacon.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And all those people who were
wanting to go to the reception

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:90%
were staring.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And he came up, and he said some
really beautiful things to me.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And he blessed me, and
it was very powerful.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so humbled.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I had to go lie down for hours.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard that they
canceled the reception.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness,

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And so it
wasn't because of me.

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was a great thing
about I thought how--

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go saying
what can I get?

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I went thinking,
what can I give him?

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.467 align:middle line:84%
How can I be there and just
receive and give so much love?

00:49:40.467 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is such a great
role model for all of us.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:84%
To any situation--
what can I give?

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.288 align:middle line:90%
What can I give today?

00:49:47.288 --> 00:49:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And not what am I going to get?

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.538 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to get?

00:49:49.538 --> 00:49:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole world is so
entrenched in what am I getting,

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and it has created
such evil and darkness.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.160 align:middle line:90%
What can I give?

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's the
simplest situation.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's to somebody
checking you out at the grocery

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.540 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.650 align:middle line:84%
What can I give pulls
you into your highest.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to live
your truest purpose, which

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:84%
is to create a vibration
of love that day.

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.327 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so interesting
because this whole community

00:50:12.327 --> 00:50:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and society is around buy one,
get one, and what can you get?

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:15.817 align:middle line:90%
And it's scarcity.

00:50:15.817 --> 00:50:17.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
have enough, and there's

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.540 align:middle line:90%
survival attached to that.

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're coming from a
completely different place,

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:90%
which leads to simplicity.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So this other picture,
you were going--

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is this a journey that
you took people on?

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it India?

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: No.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a pilgrimage
that I took to India.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.808 align:middle line:84%
India has been my
spiritual home for decades

00:50:35.808 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:90%
before I even went there.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I've only been
there several times.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:43.270 align:middle line:10%
But I was in India and going
to just all the temples

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.550 align:middle line:10%
and experiencing
incredible darshan

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:49.540 align:middle line:10%
of the energy and the vibration
of a lot of the teachings

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:10%
that started me out on my path.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful level of
the vibration of the sacred,

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.940 align:middle line:84%
even with people who are
living with so little

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and have tremendous joy and
happiness in their heart.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I love India.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I would go every
year if I could.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:90%
My house looks like India.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so people walk
in, and they go,

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:84%
this is more Indian than
my house, and I'm Indian.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's my spiritual roots.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's your
spiritual roots.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.077 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: And when
I met the Dalai Lama--

00:51:23.077 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to say this,
but when he came over,

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.368 align:middle line:90%
and he put a scarf around me.

00:51:26.368 --> 00:51:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me,
and he said, India.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't mean am I
Indian, which I can look.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:90%
He meant, India, past life?

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:90%
It was really powerful.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.232 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So how validating.

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DE ANGELIS: It was amazing.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:90%
He just said India.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There's some beautiful
pictures here of you in India,

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.475 align:middle line:90%
and your dressed as--

00:51:50.475 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: I feel completely
comfortable as an Indian.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:84%
No if I could-- that's
how I feel comfortable.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.425 align:middle line:84%
From the second I first put
on a sari in life or anything,

00:51:59.425 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The second I met my
first spiritual teacher,

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.730 align:middle line:90%
everything was so normal to me.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything Indian was more
normal than anything else.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's in my what
everyone believes in,

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.968 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly
in my spiritual DNA.

00:52:11.968 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes
a beautiful sense,

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.112 align:middle line:84%
and for anyone else
who is called that way,

00:52:16.112 --> 00:52:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and you found the validation.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:17.890 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.348 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Except
you know what?

00:52:19.348 --> 00:52:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people,
briefly, people

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.730 align:middle line:84%
think of going on a
pilgrimage to India or Peru.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:28.300 align:middle line:84%
The real pilgrimage is
always into the heart.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The real pilgrimage we
can experience ourselves.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We can take a two-minute
pilgrimage by closing our eyes

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or having a beautiful photo
and asking for blessings

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:90%
or offering blessings.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what we can
do, no matter what.

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to have it
glamorous and dramatic

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:90%
on the outside.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we're in love,
we are at the center

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:50.930 align:middle line:90%
of all sacred places.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:53.863 align:middle line:90%
You have a beautiful meditation.

00:52:53.863 --> 00:52:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask our
audience to just wherever you

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.350 align:middle line:84%
are, just relax, just
sit back, and receive

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:04.570 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful meditation
for peace and for love.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Just close your eyes and enjoy.

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: This is
Dr. Barbara DeAngelis.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to offer you
my soul shifts blessing

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.880 align:middle line:90%
prayer for the planet.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:84%
This blessing prayer is
described in my book,

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
"Soul Shifts," and it's
a powerful practice

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:34.450 align:middle line:84%
you can offer to the world
and all who inhabit it.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:84%
When you offer
this blessing, you

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:84%
will shift your identification
into your highest

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and lift yourself up to your
most elevated vibration.

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, more than ever, Our
world needs this blessing.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You may want to close your eyes
and take a few deep breaths

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and allow the space around
your heart to be very open.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Visualize our planet.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
embracing it with love.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I offer my blessings to
the planet Earth, my home

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.380 align:middle line:10%
while I am in this body.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.045 align:middle line:10%
May grace now shower upon the
world and restore it to peace.

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:44.600 align:middle line:10%


00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.910 align:middle line:10%
May all who suffer now
be comforted and healed.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.730 align:middle line:10%


00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:10%
May all who are oppressed now
be liberated and their dignity

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.170 align:middle line:10%
redeemed.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.110 align:middle line:10%
May all who are lost
in forgetfulness

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:09.130 align:middle line:10%
now awaken from the great sleep
and return to remembrance.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:12.420 align:middle line:10%
May all beings now live
together in perfect harmony.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.510 align:middle line:10%
May all souls now align
with their highest.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:10%
May all souls now find
their way back to love,

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.840 align:middle line:10%
and may that love
be all that is.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:35.490 align:middle line:90%


00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:10%
May that one perfect light
now triumph over all darkness,

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.715 align:middle line:10%
in all people, and all
places, seen and unseen.

00:55:44.715 --> 00:55:47.430 align:middle line:10%


00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And may that one perfect
light prevail for all time.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.925 align:middle line:10%
May there be peace.

00:55:55.925 --> 00:55:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.610 align:middle line:10%
May there be peace.

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:03.435 align:middle line:10%


00:56:03.435 --> 00:56:05.383 align:middle line:10%
May there be peace.

00:56:05.383 --> 00:56:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: May there be peace.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.770 align:middle line:90%
May there be peace.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I love that you said that.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:19.920 align:middle line:84%
In all that you
do, Barbara, in all

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.650 align:middle line:84%
of the years that
you've been teaching

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and the books and the
incredible experiences,

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:28.190 align:middle line:90%
what is your biggest why?

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:31.850 align:middle line:84%
What gets you up every day
to do this again and again?

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:33.545 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.545 --> 00:56:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: We talked
about those questions

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:84%
before, why is this
happening to me?

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Why did this person
do this or that?

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:84%
My original why was why
is the world like this?

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But I actually, whenever I
ask a why about anything,

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:51.794 align:middle line:90%
I always go to a how.

00:56:51.794 --> 00:56:53.690 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is the world this way?

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Why am I feeling--

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:90%
I always go to how.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.870 align:middle line:90%
How can I help more?

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.100 align:middle line:90%
How can I serve more?

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the only
other why would be

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.510 align:middle line:84%
why can't I live for
hundreds of years right now?

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I have so
much more to teach.

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of at the prime
of my wisdom and my love.

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.620 align:middle line:10%
I want to just live
a long, long time

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:19.040 align:middle line:10%
so I can continue to fulfill
my own spiritual contract

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.350 align:middle line:10%
and help uplift the planet.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.230 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just going
to go with the how.

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.740 align:middle line:90%
How can I do that?

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:90%
How can I keep serving?

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.480 align:middle line:84%
How can I feel at
peace in my own heart

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that I've given enough,
loved enough, offered enough

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.910 align:middle line:90%
in my life?

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.670 align:middle line:10%
So my whole goal in
life now is to help

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.738 align:middle line:10%
people rise to their highest.

00:57:40.738 --> 00:57:42.280 align:middle line:10%
Then there's more
people to play with

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.960 align:middle line:10%
and the we becomes
joyful and the

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.250 align:middle line:10%
we becomes what my vision
and I think your vision,

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.730 align:middle line:10%
Gaia's vision is what
the world is meant to be.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and it is also a
sense of urgency around this.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to make this
choice for love in order

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.485 align:middle line:90%
to help this planet right now.

00:58:00.485 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: Now, more than
ever, make the choice for love.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Figure out what that is.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you can.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Follow the path.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Read.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Learn.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DE ANGELIS: The universe
is counting on each of us.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Very, very
important message.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
