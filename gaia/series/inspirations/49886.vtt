00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:10%
Doctors at the hospital had
given Anita Moorjani only hours

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.160 align:middle line:10%
to live when she
arrived at the hospital.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:10%
And she was unable to move.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:10%
She was in a coma as a
result of the cancer that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:10%
had ravaged her body
for over three years.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And Anita is here today.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to
share her experience

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of entering into
another dimension

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and being given a choice whether
to return to life or not.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And her entire story is outlined
in her book, Dying to be Me.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And she is here today.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.594 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> ANITA MOORJANI: Hi, Lisa.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Thank you for being
here and what you've brought

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.592 align:middle line:84%
back to share with
us is incredible.

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you look in the
mirror every day

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.976 align:middle line:84%
and just thank God
that you're back?

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Oh, gosh, yes.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Every day I think,
wow, what a gift just

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:10%
to be given this
second chance at life.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Mind you, even though it
was amazingly beautiful

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:10%
in the other realm.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.144 align:middle line:84%
And a huge part of me
didn't want to come back.

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We're going
to talk about that,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
but I want to back up for
a second to your childhood

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and how you grew up.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.486 align:middle line:90%
Where were you raised?

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was
raised in Hong Kong.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.568 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, you
were in Hong Kong.

00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And what was your
upbringing like?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.757 align:middle line:84%
Was it a fairly
strict upbringing?

00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: You know, parts
of my upbringing was really

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
magical, but there was a lot of
parts that was also confusing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%
because my parents are Indian.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:90%
They're Hindu.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Hong
Kong but because they

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to be able
to speak English,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
they put me into
a British school.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of the local schools
in Hong Kong are Chinese.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So they put me into
a British school.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So there I was in
a British school,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
the other kids in my
class were all Westerners,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:90%
they were all British kids.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much
the only Indian kid.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So I got bullied a lot
because I stood out.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So I got discriminated
against quite a lot.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.971 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak to my
parents a lot about that.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So I kept that to myself.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why not?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: There were
a couple of reasons.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I had a problem first
in the first school I went to

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and my parents had
me change schools.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So they moved me
to another school

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I had another
set of problems.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to cause
them too much trouble.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew that they'd
already changed one school

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:90%
or had me change one school.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is to
do with our culture.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
In Indian culture, the gender
disparity between men and women

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
is huge.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So women are seen as
second class citizens.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:90%
As a little girl, I sensed that.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Even as a very young child
I remember somebody actually

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
saying to my mother,
were you disappointed

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that your child was born a girl?

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I already had a
sense that I was inferior

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:90%
because I was a girl.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So coupled with the fact that
I was inferior in my culture

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
because I was a girl, I
was inferior in my school

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:90%
because I was not white.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
together kind of made

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
me feel that there was
something wrong with me.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
That it wasn't
them, but I actually

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
believed there was
something wrong with me.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And did
you have brothers?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.791 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I had one brother.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Older brother.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.775 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he was
very protective.

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:90%
He and I are very, very close.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So with
that growing up,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
were you also assumed
into an arranged marriage?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And I rebelled against that.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But what ended up happening
was that my parents

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:90%
did arrange a marriage for me.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Just in the last days running
up to the wedding, I ran away.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.041 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was
in my very early 20s.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And it caused a huge
problem in our community.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.811 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, I'm sure.

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
With the other family
and your family.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.172 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly about the
families marrying.

00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Oh, it is.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the two
individuals getting married,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a matchmaking
of two families.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.865 align:middle line:84%
And our Indian
community is so tight,

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
we still have this whole
caste system thing.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So everybody who was
off the same caste

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
as we were-- not just in Hong
Kong, but all over the world--

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
heard about this,
that I had run away.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And so people were saying,
who does she think she is?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I was told that no other
Indian man would marry me.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.254 align:middle line:90%
All of this by your early 20s.

00:04:50.254 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But something gave
you the courage

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.637 align:middle line:84%
to run away, because you had
to have known that was coming.

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I know.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't tell if it was
the fear of getting married

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
into this family,
into this situation,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid of
letting them down

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
or the courage of being
able to run away from it.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a combination of the
two, because as we got closer

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
to the wedding date,
I started to realize

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
what they expected of me.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt I
don't think I'll

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
be able to meet
their expectations.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.751 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Such as?

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: This is typical
of traditional Indian marriage,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to make it
about them specifically,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
but what was expected of me was
to be able to cook and clean

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and be a housewife and
have children very quickly.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to continue studying.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to finish university,
I wanted to get a job.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:90%
That was out of the question.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to travel the world.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely out of the question.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was expected to
go to the temple twice a week

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and do the worship.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and we had to live with
the family, the in-laws.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed
to take care of them.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.607 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, I don't
know if I can do this.

00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: This is involved.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.512 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: Well, I ran away
to a friend's house in India.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.572 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Well, you ran far.

00:06:17.572 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I ran far.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I hid out for a month.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I stayed at her place.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:90%
She was a very good friend.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:90%
She was wonderful.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
She actually kept me
without telling anyone.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Only my parents
knew where I was.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
At that point my parents
were actually pretty good.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They also didn't
tell anyone else

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
where I was because they knew
that my fiance's family were

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.715 align:middle line:84%
very, very upset and
they were looking for me.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:47.187 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:47.187 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:90%
What would they have done?

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, with all of that you
mention the word "fear"

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:90%
several times.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.022 align:middle line:84%
So you grew up around several
situations of deep, deep fear.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: At what point did you
realize that you had cancer?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.736 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Oh.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, at the time
when I was settling down--

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
ready to settle down-- and
I'd met my husband, Danny,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:90%
who is actually amazing--

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.681 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: How did you meet Danny?

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I have to hear about that
now after the whole marriage

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and the arranged thing.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.471 align:middle line:84%
Where did you finally
meet your husband?

00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: You know, it's
just incredible because Danny is

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
also Indian.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny because my
parents were telling me

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.826 align:middle line:84%
that now all the Indian
guys in our community

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%
were not going to marry me.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Their parents will never
let their sons marry me.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I became a little
more rebellious and defiant

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and I said, that's
all right, I'm

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
not going to marry
an Indian guy.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's
something in our culture

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
which is also not accepted,
especially at that time

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
back over 20 years.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, it
was definitely not

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
accepted to marry a non-Indian.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So my parents were still hopeful
that I'd meet somebody Indian.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had totally
rejected the idea.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Then I met Danny through
a friend who was not

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
trying to fix us up, in fact,
she was interested in him.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we met in the
room, he completely

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
didn't even notice my friend.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
He spent the whole
evening talking to me.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was cautious
because I had just

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
run away from this
arranged marriage.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to get
into another situation

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:90%
with another Indian man.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And so
I was very cautious,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
but he continued to pursue me.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so one day I
actually said to him,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Do you know
the stories about me?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
happened to me?"

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And then he goes, "Yes, I do."

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
what do you think?"

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, "That's
why I love you more,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
'cause you have a
mind of your own."

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So then you said, this
is the man for me.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So I thought,
OK, he's all right.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:90%
He's really all right.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The other interesting thing
was that the rumor that

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
went around, which is crazy,
was that the reason I didn't

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
get married or
that I ran away was

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
want to do housework.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'd reduced
it down to that.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And Danny had heard
that rumor, too.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So he responded by saying,
you don't have to worry,

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I do windows.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I do laundry.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I cook.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.567 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's hilarious.

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:26.275 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, you
were probably speaking

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
for a lot women who really,
deep down inside didn't

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
want to have that role done
either, which is probably

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.881 align:middle line:90%
why it spread so fast.

00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yeah, I think so.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I mean, my goodness.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, in a
certain way, you

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
have spoken for many people
in many ways in your life.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And you've given voice to many
different people in your life.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:90%
So back to the cancer.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:90%
So did you marry?

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.854 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So we got married
and then I did start working

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:90%
for a few years.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But when we were ready to settle
down and have children, that

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
was when I started to
notice something was wrong.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Something wasn't quite right.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I noticed a lump in my
neck, in my collar bone.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And I went to have it
checked out at the doctor.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.061 align:middle line:84%
It started out where
the doctor said,

00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:13.477 align:middle line:84%
"It could be just
a swollen gland.

00:10:13.477 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
you on antibiotics."

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't go away.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they did a biopsy and
they confirmed it was lymphoma.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.925 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So
that was a shock.

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: At what age was this?

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was
in my late 30s.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.034 align:middle line:90%
In my 30s.

00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We actually have
a picture here of you with

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
your husband cutting
your birthday cake.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure what
birthday this was.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, this was, in fact,
this was well into the cancer

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
after it had progressed
quite dramatically.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so you were going
through the treatment with

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Danny.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.642 align:middle line:84%
He was there by your
side the whole time.

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
mention at this point

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is that even before
I got diagnosed,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.139 align:middle line:84%
my best friend got
diagnosed with cancer.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.888 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
still healthy and fine.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And my best friend, who
was vibrant and healthy,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
she got diagnosed all
of a sudden with cancer.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
her deteriorate.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched
her deteriorate,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:90%
I became so fearful of cancer.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Just so fearful.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
everything in the news--

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
emails and a lot of stuff

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.553 align:middle line:84%
on social media about different
things that cause cancer.

00:11:35.553 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We were reading things like
microwaves cause cancer.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.134 align:middle line:90%
Plastic bottles cause cancer.

00:11:43.134 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Just about everything.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.735 align:middle line:90%
Sunshine causes cancer.

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Red meat causes cancer.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Dairy products-- it
was like everything.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So I started becoming
paranoid about cancer

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:90%
because here was my best friend.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And six months after my
best friend was diagnosed,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.326 align:middle line:84%
Danny's brother-in-law
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It was everywhere.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.741 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: It was everywhere.

00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So I felt, wow, it's right
here in front of my nose.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.552 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing
statistics like, you know,

00:12:11.552 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
advertisements for
anti-cancer supplements

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and they say things
like, one in three people

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
are going to get cancer.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So I started to do
everything to avoid cancer.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I started taking supplements.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I started taking
wheat grass shots.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:90%
I went vegan and organic.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing all those
things even before it

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:84%
was fashionable to
do all those things.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was following a
proper anti-cancer diet.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And it continued to--

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.017 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And
it was after that.

00:12:46.017 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, it was after.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was obsessive
about cancer and I got

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.465 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with cancer.

00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And I say this--
and I don't want people to fear

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
being on such diets, because I'm
going to explain that, in fact,

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to liberate
people from that fear.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do you believe that
that fear in any way was

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
something that you were
so obsessed about that you

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
attracted it in any way?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.672 align:middle line:84%
That's a very odd
question to most people.

00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
explain and qualify this

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
people to think that they

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
can attract cancer
with their fear.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
say that happened

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
with me is that I feel I
spent a lifetime coming

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:84%
from a place of fear with
every choice and every decision

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I made.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: As you explained.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So everything I did, even my
choice of eating healthy foods

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and following a
vegan diet, all of it

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
was not because I loved
my body or my life,

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
it was because I feared cancer.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching my
best friend die of cancer.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
My husband's brother-in-law--
both of them died.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
the best treatment

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that money can buy in the top
cancer institutes in the world.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And this made me believe
that it doesn't matter

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
what you do for
treatment, where you go,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:90%
cancer has a mind of its own.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt that basically if you
have cancer, you're gonna die.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I was
diagnosed with cancer,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.047 align:middle line:84%
it was still early stages,
but I just felt I'm gonna die.

00:14:31.047 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It was an instant
death sentence for you?

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: It was absolutely
an instant death sentence.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.705 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:14:35.705 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what you believed?

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.153 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: That's what
I believed because I felt

00:14:38.153 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm already doing everything
anti-cancer and I've still got

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching these two
people who are close to me,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to the best
hospitals that money can buy

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.057 align:middle line:90%
and they're still deteriorating.

00:14:54.057 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So in this photo,
you're blowing out a birthday

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:90%
candle.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you happen to remember
what was going on in your mind

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: This was one of
my better days because my days

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.539 align:middle line:90%
were like really up and down.

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Really up and down.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were days where I
would just be so depressed.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And there were some days where
I would read something good

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
be really hopeful

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and some days I would
be really depressed.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
This, as I said, was
one of my better days.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:84%
As the cancer
progressed though-- as I

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
got towards the end,
towards the day when

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I went into the coma, which
was February 2, 2006--

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
as I got closer to that
day, I couldn't even go out.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't leave the house.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to be at home
and not stay in hospital.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
But I had to keep going into
hospital for treatments.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But towards the end I
could no longer walk.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
My muscles had
completely deteriorated.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I had these big open skin
lesions-- one on my neck, one

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
under my arm.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And my lungs were
filled with fluid.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't talk
without wheezing.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't lie down.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
If I lied flat, I would
choke on my own fluid.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I was really,
really in bad shape.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And you couldn't eat?

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.216 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I couldn't eat.

00:16:10.216 --> 00:16:11.579 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't digesting any food.

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Was it
because of the chemo?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.953 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: It was.

00:16:13.953 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And also because my body had
just stopped digesting food.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was also doing a
lot of natural things,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
but everything I was doing, I
was just so tensed and fearful.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And so on February 2, I
just went into a coma.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was at home that
morning and my husband

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:84%
called a doctor who said
to rush me to the hospital.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then this report
that we have here is basically

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
a doctor's report saying that
you have full lymphoma in many

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:90%
places in your body.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: This was the report
from February 2 of 2006 where

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:90%
it lists where the tumors are.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Many of the tumors are
the size of lemons.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from
this report that there

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
are tumors in my neck, my chest,
all the way down to my abdomen.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It had spread throughout
my lymphatic system.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And my organs were
now shutting down.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors said that's
why I was in the coma

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and that I wouldn't even
make it through the night.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be
alive the next day.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you went into the
hospital and they say that

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the systems start to fail before
somebody actually passes over.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.717 align:middle line:90%
What was your experience?

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember going
to the hospital?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I do.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
what I didn't realize

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
was that I was in
the coma because I

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
was aware of everything
that was going on around me.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then even when I was
rushed into the hospital,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of what the doctors
were saying to my family.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And they put me in the ICU
and they were putting tubes

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
into me and things they
were telling my husband.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.729 align:middle line:90%
And I was aware of everything.

00:17:57.729 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because you could
hear it or because you could

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
actually see it?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I
could even see it.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I could see them.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I could see the doctors.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:84%
These were doctors I
had never seen before,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
but here I was seeing them
treating me for the first time

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.017 align:middle line:84%
because it was the doctor
that was on duty at that time.

00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did you have a
perspective as if you were

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
above looking below, or were
you in your body looking out?

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: It
was really strange.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the part that's
really hard to explain.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I was no longer in my body.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I could see my
body on the hospital bed.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And my body looked really small
and insignificant because I

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:90%
felt incredible and expanded.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't like at one place.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It was like I could
be everywhere.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I put my
awareness, there I was.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
If I put my awareness
on my husband,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I was right there with
him, almost being him.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like I could
feel his emotions.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:90%
My mother was there.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When I put my
awareness on my mother,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I could feel what
she was feeling.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I would put my
awareness on the doctors

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.969 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel the
hopelessness they were feeling.

00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You could
feel the emotions.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I have mentioned that I
was in a similar situation.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's that complete oneness.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That complete blurred
lines between you

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.449 align:middle line:90%
and anything else at all.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: It is.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: There is no boundary.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: No,
there's no boundary.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I was
without my physical body,

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
the physical body gives you
this feeling of separation.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Without the physical
body, it almost

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:90%
feels like I'm fluid or etheric.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.044 align:middle line:84%
I could be anywhere and
everywhere at the same time.

00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I always say that
even though we have magnificent

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
bodies that they
are just boundaries.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
They're just these cases that
we live in and we operate from.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.806 align:middle line:90%
We need them.

00:19:51.806 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're very intelligent,
the way they operate.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness expands
far beyond our bodies.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: Oh,
far, far beyond.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Far beyond.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we are aware of
who that consciousness is,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or what that consciousness is,
what I realized in that state,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in that realm, was I
became aware of how amazing

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and magnificent
and powerful I am.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt incredible.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.187 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was free.

00:20:23.187 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It's boundaryless.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I was so free from
that painful body

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
because I had been in so
much pain and discomfort.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So if this was the
first sense of painlessness you

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
felt and real true
freedom you'd felt,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
which you really haven't
experienced yet in your life

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
at this point, why would
you want to come back?

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: See, that's
a really good question.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I felt the same way.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: You know, and at
first I didn't want to come

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
So I was aware I had the choice.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I was aware I was dying.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I was aware I had the choice
and I looked at my body.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way I wanted
to come back to that body.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It's sick.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.237 align:middle line:90%
It's dying.

00:21:02.237 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's small.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: It's small.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
It's restrictive.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I was suffering.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
My family was suffering
taking care of that body.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I encountered my
father and, interestingly,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.184 align:middle line:84%
even my best friend who
had died from cancer.

00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Your father had
passed at this point?

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: My father
had passed 10 years prior.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I had always
felt my father was disappointed

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in me because I had not complied
with the arranged marriage

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been a
rebellious daughter.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I married Danny,
it was after my father

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
had passed away.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So he never got to--

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So he never
got to see me get married.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So you thought.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.458 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
So I thought.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought my father
had waited my whole life

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to get me married and then I get
married after he passes away.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But when I
encountered my father,

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I realized he had
been with me even

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
through my wedding, he'd been
with me through my illness,

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and that he loved
me unconditionally.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:90%
He didn't judge me at all.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It was like he
completely understood me.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.392 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never felt
understood by him.

00:22:09.392 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you felt
that at that moment.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
You felt the forgiveness
and the love-- unconditional

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
love from your father
at that moment.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I did.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
in that state

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
when I felt this unconditional
love from my father,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I realized that when we lose our
bodies-- when I crossed over--

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
not only did I lose my body,
but together with my body

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
went my culture, my beliefs, my
religion, my gender, my race.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:90%
All of that is part of the body.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I realized it's not part
of our consciousness.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So all I was, all that is
left, is just pure essence.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.445 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The evidence would
show you that that is who you.

00:22:54.445 --> 00:22:55.404 align:middle line:90%
You are your culture.

00:22:55.404 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
You were born into
this situation.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:90%
You are the body.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you leave
that realm and you

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
go into a pure state of
consciousness, which we

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
all really have all
the time, that you

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
go into that place of realizing
it's so insignificant.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.711 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: It really
is insignificant.

00:23:12.711 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And I got to ask
you about your father.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.954 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel him?

00:23:16.954 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Oh, gosh.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I felt him.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was like we merged.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We communicated not like
linguistically like we do here.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't have biology.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't have voices.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:90%
But you don't need it there.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like we merged
and I knew exactly what

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.721 align:middle line:84%
he wanted me to know
just in an instant.

00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: In detail, too.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.678 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: In detail.

00:23:40.678 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's no room
for miscommunication.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's a great point.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
You got everything as if he
would have said the words,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.475 align:middle line:90%
but there's no words need.

00:23:51.475 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: There
was no words needed.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I understood was
that just as much as I thought

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I was a victim of my culture,
he was a victim of our culture,

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So whatever pressures I felt
from him and his strictness

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and whatever I felt, it
was because he was equally

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:90%
a victim of the same culture.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But here in this state, we were
both without all those filters,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
all those layers and
layers of cultural, gender,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:90%
racial, whatever, filters.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:90%
They were all gone.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was just his pure
essence and my pure essence.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And all we had for each other
was pure, unconditional love.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: Did he
apologize in essence at all?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that from him?

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I felt that energy.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I felt that I

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't require him to
apologize because there's

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:84%
this instant empathy
and understanding like,

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, you were a victim
of the culture, too.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:90%
It was like, I understand.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And so there was no need
for apology or forgiveness

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:84%
or anything because suddenly
you see right through the person

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:90%
to who they really are.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just the most
incredible, beautiful state.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So then you
looked at your body,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.212 align:middle line:84%
and what made you possibly
want to get back in there?

00:25:15.212 --> 00:25:16.554 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:25:16.554 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's
obvious to us here,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:90%
but what was that moment like?

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: OK.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:84%
That moment was when I
understood that heaven is not

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
a place but it's a state.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And whether I chose to
stay there or come back

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
into the body, now that
I knew what I knew,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I would bring heaven with me.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that now
that I knew who I really was,

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:84%
my body would heal
very, very rapidly.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.112 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is not a
place, it's a state.

00:25:50.112 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you brought
it back in with you?

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And you
can carry it with you.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:90%
You bring it with you.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:90%
You create it.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:90%
You bring it with you.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you
opened your eyes?

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Or how did that moment
occur when you came up out

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:90%
of the coma?

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So I was in
the coma for about 30 hours.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And because there's no
time and space there,

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I felt so much happened.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
to open my eyes,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
everybody was really
shocked that I

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:90%
was coming out of the coma.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Your vitals
started coming back?

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:10%
And within a day I didn't
need the oxygen anymore.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:10%
By the following day,
I was telling them

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:10%
they can remove the
food tube, that I

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:10%
was ready to eat solid foods.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
The doctors wouldn't believe me.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we've got
to keep the food tube in.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I'm ready.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm going to be fine.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
tell them things.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Like I recognized the
doctor who was there

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to see us when we
entered the hospital.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
When he walked in the room, I
said, good afternoon, Dr. Chan.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how did
you recognize me?

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, aren't
you the doctor

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that was there when we
came into the hospital?

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "But
you were in a coma.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:90%
How could you have seen me?"

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And things like
that were happening.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
saying to my husband,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:84%
"Isn't he the doctor
that said I'm not

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.844 align:middle line:84%
going to make it
through the night?"

00:27:11.844 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And my husband said, "He didn't
even say that in the room.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
He said that outside,
down the corridor

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:90%
in the nurse's station."

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so all kinds of these
things were happening.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling them all
the procedures they did.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Oh, at
5:00 AM yesterday

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
morning, you were removing
fluid from my lungs.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You put a needle
through my back."

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the
doctor said, "But how

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:90%
did you even know that?"

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that
something had happened.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But within four days, my
tumors had shrunk by 70%.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: 70%?

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.200 align:middle line:90%
What were the doctors saying?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: They didn't
even know what to write

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
in my medical records.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.344 align:middle line:84%
My oncologist who was treating
me, he actually said that.

00:27:55.344 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't even
know what to write

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:90%
in your medical records.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of joked
and made this gesture

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of throwing it in the dust
bin, in the waste bin.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because science
couldn't explain it.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.916 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And he
couldn't explain it.

00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Science couldn't explain it.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But the feeling I had in
me was not that my body was

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
going to heal quickly,
it was that I was already

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
healed but my body
had to catch up.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the feeling.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: We have a picture
here of Anita a few days after

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:10%
your-- it was maybe this was a
few weeks after you'd healed.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>> MOORJANI: Oh, this was a
few weeks after my hair started

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:10%
growing.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:10%
But to put it all
into context, I mean,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:10%
I was released from the hospital
five weeks later completely

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:10%
cancer free.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But at that time when
I came out of the coma,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.175 align:middle line:84%
I was still very
weak and I had to eat

00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
and I had to start walking.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So within three weeks, they
could find no trace of cancer.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I only stayed the
extra two weeks

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
so that I could
build up my strength

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and start walking again.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And then two weeks after
coming out of the hospital,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I was attending a friend's
wedding and dancing

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.639 align:middle line:90%
and drinking champagne.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So you really made
that decision.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I love the look in your
face in this picture

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:84%
because your eyes are so
wide and so full of hope.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And really they have a
little bit of knowing to them

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen-- I've seen it
and I've come back to tell.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, that choice, because
at the beginning of the show

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.935 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that you
were given a choice.

00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Was it the divine or any
words or any godlike figure

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that came to you and said, "You
have a choice to come back."

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.942 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we see
in the movies, right?

00:29:43.942 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting to explain.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want to explain
this properly.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
God, or whatever

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we'd like to call
any divine presence,

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that this divine
presence is separate from us.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It feels separate when
we're in a physical body,

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
but without the body, it
was like I merged with it--

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:90%
my father, me, my best friend.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation
between all of us.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like all of us together
are part of this divine.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
We are all expressions of it.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words,
I don't believe

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:90%
that life happens to me.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a victim of life.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Life happens through me.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I am an expression of life.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The divine expresses
itself through me.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in
that realm, I could

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
say the decision came from
me, but the greater me that's

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:90%
connected to the divine.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Or I could say it came from God.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:84%
It would mean one
and the same thing.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that experience and
expression comes through you

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.017 align:middle line:90%
every moment of the day.

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Every moment.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And right now.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: That is what
bringing heaven to earth means

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did you know that was
going to happen when you were

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.334 align:middle line:84%
making that choice
to come back in?

00:31:00.334 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: What happened
is that when I was making

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the choice, or when I was
presented with the choice,

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I felt that the choice
was there for me.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my father
communicating to me.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And my father said to me,
if I had to put words,

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
he said to me that
"it's not your time.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to go
back to experience

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
the gifts that are
waiting for you."

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that I had spent
all this time suffering,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
but now was a time when I
had gifts waiting for me.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So now was not the time to
say, no, I'm not going back.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You were excited.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I was
excited to come back.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: To start living.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.395 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I wanted to
see what those gifts were.

00:31:44.395 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I was now excited.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.025 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, we have a picture
here of the report that shows-

00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
that your body-- the doctors
actually did finally write it--

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and saying that your body
is completely cancer free.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no detectable
trace of lymphoma.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what they did was
they took every possible test.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
They did a lymph node
biopsy, a bone marrow biopsy.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling them,
you don't need to do this.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:90%
The cancer is gone.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying,
cancer doesn't just

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:90%
disappear like this.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
We just have to find it.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.774 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:32:24.774 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And, you know, they
were wonderful, caring doctors.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.754 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely wonderful.

00:32:28.754 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
the belief system.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.169 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: They had to
do what they had to do.

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They had to be cautious.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I felt--
it was very painful.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.050 align:middle line:90%
The tests were very painful.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, God, I've
come back and all they're doing

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:90%
is giving me all this pain.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so at that time, I started
to feel that it's painful

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:84%
being back in this body because
they were doing these surgeries

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and a bone marrow biopsy
is extremely painful.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But today, I am
so glad that they

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:84%
took those tests because I have
the proof that it happened.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that
you were-- somehow

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the divine knew you were
going to have to prove this

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to every community
because it's a miracle.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
define miracle?

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I define miracle
as something that is outside

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of our belief system.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So if something happens that
you cannot explain it within

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
your belief system or your
paradigm, it's a miracle.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.521 align:middle line:84%
So currently medical
science cannot explain this.

00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well the gift is that
you've been able to now start

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:90%
to express this.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
the essence from you

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that
you are here to tell

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and your gifts that
you are here to tell.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look
quickly at the clip from CNN

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:84%
because she's been covered
on every major news

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
organization with her story.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.212 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this clip.

00:33:55.212 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>> INTERVIEWER: But you
could still see your husband.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And how was he reacting to the
fact that you were in this coma

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:10%
and he thought he
was losing you?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: He was
very distraught.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:90%
He was there by my bedside.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
He was holding my
hand and I could

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.304 align:middle line:84%
feel he was willing
me to come back.

00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERVIEWER: And you
had a choice to make.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I had a choice as
to whether to come back or not.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
At first, I absolutely
did not want

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.880 align:middle line:84%
to come back because why
would I want to come back

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:90%
into this sick and dying body?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But then it was as
though in the next moment

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I understood why
I had the cancer.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
All the years of beating
myself up, feeling flawed,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:84%
had turned my own energy against
me and manifested as cancer.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERVIEWER: Fear, in
a way, poisoned your body.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes, it did.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that now that
I knew this, my body would heal.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERVIEWER: You had this
huge revelation and Soni

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and your father both affirmed
what needed to be done.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: Both
of them said to me,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
"Go back and live
you're life fearlessly."

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:16.429 align:middle line:84%
And it was around that time
that I started to come back.

00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERVIEWER: So how
long were you in the coma?

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.636 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: About 30 hours.

00:35:19.636 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I was in the
intensive care unit.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But within four days they were
able to take off the oxygen,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:84%
they were able to take
out the food tube,

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and the tumors shrunk by 70%.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> INTERVIEWER: And the
doctors, they kept testing you.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They kept looking
for your cancer.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:90%
They kept treating you.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They were saying there's
no way that cancer

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:90%
disappears like that.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you came back in
with these messages that you

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:90%
want to communicate.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And just the essence
of you being here

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
communicates a massive message
as we see from your story.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And I see as the most
significant part of your story

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:84%
isn't only the cancer,
but it was the fear

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that you had been making every
decision from before you even

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:90%
had cancer.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.046 align:middle line:84%
Even up to the point of
being afraid of attracting--

00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:90%
of getting cancer.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.884 align:middle line:84%
Did anyone in your family,
by the way, have cancer?

00:36:17.884 --> 00:36:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: No.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no cancer in my family.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even a good
candidate for cancer

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
family history of cancer.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So as you're going through
these tests and so forth

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors are telling
you, "We know it's there;

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
we just need to find it."

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Was that fear even there at all?

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That essence of it?

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Not at all.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Once I came out of the
near death experience,

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I knew that because I was meant
to come back and live my life,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was healthy.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I knew that nothing
can override that now.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And what did
you come back to do?

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are the
messages that you

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:90%
want to communicate to us now?

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: The biggest message
that I want people to know is I

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
would love for people to
know how incredibly powerful,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
amazing, and
magnificent they are.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Every single person.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
That was the biggest
thing I realized

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
is that I realized that
life strips it away from us.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Life erodes our power
and our magnificence

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and just how incredible we are.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:90%
A lot of things about life.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we go to school and
we learn to be competitive.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
competitive, it means

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
you need to make other
people lose so you can win.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And nobody needs to do that.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I learned that the most
important thing for us

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to do or be is to
just be who we are.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Just come and express
ourselves and be

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:84%
who we were put on
this planet to be.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not about comparing with
other people or competing

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
or being made to
feel small because we

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:90%
watch the advertisements on TV.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just about valuing
and loving who we are.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
The biggest lesson
that saved my life,

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the thing that made me
understand why I had cancer

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
was in realizing that I had
never loved and valued myself.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:90%
That was the biggest thing.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And when we love and value
ourselves, the fear goes away.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about trying
to get rid of the fear,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:84%
it's just about
increasing the love

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%
and value we have for ourselves.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:84%
When we love and
value ourselves,

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:84%
there's no room for
fear because you

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:84%
can't have love and fear
exist simultaneously.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What does that mean
to love and value yourself?

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.346 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: OK.

00:38:41.346 --> 00:38:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It means to not put myself
down, not treat myself

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
like a doormat,
not forsake myself,

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to at least value and
love and care for myself

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:90%
as much as I do other people.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this experience, I
used to be a people pleaser.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything I did,
I used to do out

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:84%
of the fear of the consequences
rather than because it

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:84%
was something that
I wanted to do.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I had to make an excuse
for doing things.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It had to be because someone
else wanted me to do it

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:90%
or it pleased someone else.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would always
make myself small

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:90%
so other people could be bigger.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I would treat myself
like a doormat,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.640 align:middle line:84%
put myself down, forsake
myself, let myself down,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.440 align:middle line:90%
say yes when I meant no.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
All the classical things of
not valuing myself, low self

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
esteem, all of that
because I thought

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.210 align:middle line:84%
there was something
wrong with me.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.309 align:middle line:84%
I was bullied as a child,
discriminated against.

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You had many messages
that showed you that was

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.444 align:middle line:84%
the case and it couldn't have
been further from the truth.

00:39:45.444 --> 00:39:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: It couldn't have
been further from the truth.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.193 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But when you're faced
with those situations now

00:39:50.193 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of being the-- of saying--
really having to say no

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.891 align:middle line:84%
to something and disappointing
people or being in that place

00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of not compromising yourself,
taking care of yourself,

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
taking a nap when you need
to rather than taking care

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of somebody else,
do you do that now?

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: I do.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely do.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have realized
that it's honest to do

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
that because can you
imagine if you found out

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
people did for you,

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:84%
they did because
they felt obligated

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.980 align:middle line:84%
or because they were
too scared to say no,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:84%
not because they wanted
to do it for you.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't like to feel that
that's the reason they did it.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:90%
So now I can see it that way.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that if I'm going
to do something for someone,

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I want it to come from my heart.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is
that in this realization,

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I realize that when I
take care of myself,

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
when I really take
care of myself

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and love and value
myself for who I am,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:84%
when I do things for other
people, I really mean it.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.670 align:middle line:90%
And they know I mean it.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It must have come
in huge amounts of love.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.809 align:middle line:84%
It comes in a bigger,
greater package

00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing
it for yourself.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And I don't feel any obligation.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel any resentment
if nothing comes back

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not looking
for something to come back.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was just thinking,
you're not doing it from

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.802 align:middle line:90%
a place of selfishness--

00:41:22.802 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.531 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --as to gain a reward.

00:41:25.531 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.863 align:middle line:84%
You're doing it from
that place of boundless

00:41:27.863 --> 00:41:31.271 align:middle line:84%
love where you're not giving
or receiving, it's just is.

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: It just is.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just being who I am.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we love ourselves,
all we have to do

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is just be who we are
because we are love.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now, when
you met Wayne Dyer.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain when you met
him and what that experience was

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:84%
like because he's played a big
part in bringing your story out

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:84%
because he found
it so compelling.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I feel he was--
I was destined to meet him.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
He was destined
to be in my path.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It was our dharma to meet.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was incredible.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, after my
husband, he's probably

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the man I love most, after my
husband or immediate family.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, I can
see why he loves you.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are such a
teacher and he is, too.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And you see each
other as-- but you

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
get to actually-- when the
teacher is able to be taught,

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I see that
relationship with you.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.095 align:middle line:84%
You can teach Wayne
and Wayne teaches you.

00:42:32.095 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: He does.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's beautiful.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: He's
been so instrumental.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
so synchronistic.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I learned during my NDE,

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and this will bring me to how I
met Wayne, one of the things I

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
learned was even though I knew
that I had many gifts waiting

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
for me and I had a purpose
and that I had to come back,

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I also knew that I didn't
have to do anything.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
don't have to pursue

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.880 align:middle line:84%
or I don't have to
figure out how to do it.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to do anything.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.700 align:middle line:90%
All I had to do was be myself.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I learned that that's
all anybody has to do.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't actually have
to chase or pursue

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.230 align:middle line:84%
or anything, because the more
we chase and the more we pursue,

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.270 align:middle line:84%
the more we're actually
sending ourselves the message

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not worthy
of these things

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and I have to work
really hard to get it.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But when all you have to
do is just be who you are,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:84%
love yourself, value yourself,
whatever is truly yours

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:84%
will come to you
because it'll come

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:84%
from a place of you
being who you are.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That is how
you manifest things.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.865 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: That is
how you manifest things.

00:43:40.865 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And the more you love
yourself and value yourself,

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:90%
the more you manifest.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And some people say,
oh, I do vision boards.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it works.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It's dependent on how much
you love and value yourself.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You can do a vision board till
you turn blue in the face.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't love yourself,
it's not going to happen.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.320 align:middle line:10%
The things that
you really deserve

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:10%
are not going to
come because you

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:10%
don't believe you deserve them.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was that
I didn't put any boundaries,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
real picture or goal

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:90%
as to what was going to happen.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I just trusted and I
knew that all I had to do

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:84%
was be myself, love
myself, value myself.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And the more we value
ourselves, the more

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
we attract the things
that we deserve.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you wrote your
story on the internet somewhere,

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I wrote my
story on the internet.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.838 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just to get
it out there, right?

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even put my
real name because I

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.180 align:middle line:84%
didn't want people
to know it was me.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't even
use my whole name.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But there were certain
clues in there,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:84%
like that it said Hong
Kong and things like that.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:90%
But my story went viral.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:50.527 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect it to.

00:44:50.527 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Where did you write it?

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I wrote it
on a website about NDEs.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I submitted it and
the people said, wow,

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.880 align:middle line:84%
this is just the
most amazing NDE.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.360 align:middle line:90%
They put it on their homepage.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it attracted
a lot of oncologists

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:90%
because of the cancer angle.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So I had oncologists
contacting that website

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to get them to put
them in touch with me

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:84%
so that they could check
my medical records.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So an oncologist actually
flew to Hong Kong

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:84%
from the US and
verified everything

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.773 align:middle line:84%
and even wrote me a testimonial,
which I've put in my book.

00:45:24.773 --> 00:45:25.314 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why?

00:45:25.314 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, OK.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: He said
you should share this.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: So he we went to
the hospital where it happened

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and verified it.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:84%
He sent it to five
different cancer institutes

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.620 align:middle line:84%
who all said they've never seen
or heard of a case like this.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Then somebody sent the link
to my story to Wayne Dyer.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer said he started
reading it, he couldn't stop.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And he contacted his
publishers, who are Hay House,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and he told them,
you've got to read this.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You've got to track
this woman down.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask her if
she's willing to write a book.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And he even said he
would write the foreword

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:90%
and he would promote it.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:06.395 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's
exactly what he has done.

00:46:06.395 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture here of you
with Wayne which is wonderful

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and just one of your many ways
that you guys get together

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and you guys talk
which is so fun.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:20.380 align:middle line:84%
With all that you have been
talking about and all that you

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.210 align:middle line:84%
teach on the stage
and everything

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about in your
book, what happens when you are

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.360 align:middle line:84%
confronted with the
practical things in life

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that tend to get us down?

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.690 align:middle line:84%
The things that don't work
in our favor or people who

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.850 align:middle line:84%
try to discredit
you or unkindness.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:37.456 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:46:37.456 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: There's a
couple of things I do.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in the first instance
that I receive unkindness,

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:44.640 align:middle line:90%
it does hurt me.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm still human.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm back in this
body and it does hurt me.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But one of things that I
have come to understand

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is that when somebody is
deliberately unkind-- if it's

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
unintentional,
that's different--

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.820 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is deliberately
unkind or mean or nasty,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
through the internet

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
in person, usually

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:84%
it means that person is
hurting inside themselves.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And I now understand that.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I probably
wouldn't have before, I

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.430 align:middle line:84%
would have taken it
personally before.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Today I know it's
because they're hurting.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And the way I deal with it is
I don't respond to it directly.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I certainly don't get even.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't give back.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.520 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I actually send
them even more kindness.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing I do
know, again, which

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from
my experience is

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that we extend beyond
our physical bodies.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Our energy, basically,
we ignore that part.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.350 align:middle line:84%
We tend to listen to
people's words and language.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality,
language distracts us

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
from how we are
really feeling or how

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the other person
is really feeling.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is even while I'm
talking to somebody, if they

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.060 align:middle line:84%
are being particularly
uncooperative, unkind,

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.530 align:middle line:84%
or nasty, while I'm
speaking with them,

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I am consciously sending
them energy almost

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.320 align:middle line:84%
like embracing them and hugging
them with loving energy.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And I find that actually
changes the communication

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and the exchange that
takes place between us.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's worked for
me every single time.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's an incredible
thing to bring back from that

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.740 align:middle line:84%
experience you had is that
energy that goes beyond

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.030 align:middle line:90%
our bodies.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.290 align:middle line:84%
That you can actually
wrap somebody

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.210 align:middle line:84%
in forgiveness
and love and peace

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.354 align:middle line:84%
even though their
intentions are different.

00:48:39.354 --> 00:48:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: And I've even
done it with people who are not

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, people who I
have had email exchanges with

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.950 align:middle line:84%
where I can tell that their
emails are getting more

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and more nasty or exploitative--
they're trying to exploit me--

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I will, again,
same sort of thing.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I will visualize them, wrap
them in my energy of love,

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.470 align:middle line:84%
send them lots of
love, security.

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the next
email I get from them-- Well,

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.800 align:middle line:84%
first of all, my
response to them

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is written from that
energy, that same space.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, the response I
get from them is very different

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:15.925 align:middle line:90%
and it works every time.

00:49:15.925 --> 00:49:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything else
that bothers you or really

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:84%
upsets you in life that you
have learned to get over?

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Like you didn't
react the same way

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that you reacted when
you were younger.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: One of the things
that bothers me I think even

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:84%
now, which I have learned to
get over but still I see it

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.880 align:middle line:84%
happening all the time is
that in this day and age

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.440 align:middle line:84%
of information technology
and social media,

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:90%
people hide behind anonymity.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They hide behind a name
which is not their own.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And I find that people have
actually become nastier

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.180 align:middle line:84%
because they say things
that they would not

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:84%
say if they were
right in front of you.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean just
say things to me,

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:84%
but I see this happening a lot,
even young kids being bullied

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.870 align:middle line:84%
in social media or
people being bullied.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I find that a
really disturbing trend.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I have learned myself
to deal with it

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.590 align:middle line:84%
by sending people
love all the time.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I also feel that
it helps me to know

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of
people that do this

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.860 align:middle line:84%
are just venting their own
anger and their own pain.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.670 align:middle line:84%
If people can realize that
there are real people reading

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:36.789 align:middle line:84%
these messages and
you're hurting them

00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and affecting them.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.842 align:middle line:90%
But that happens a lot today.

00:50:38.842 --> 00:50:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: If you see someone
out there who's hurting someone

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.660 align:middle line:84%
else, like a parent screaming
at a child or people treating

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.550 align:middle line:84%
people unfairly and unkindly,
do you say something to them?

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:10%
>> MOORJANI: You know, more
often than not I just send them

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:57.690 align:middle line:10%
energy because sometimes
by saying something--

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:58.930 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: You engage.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: --I engage and
I may offend one or the other

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.742 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely do send
them energy every time.

00:51:07.742 --> 00:51:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's a great idea.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:10.116 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful solution.

00:51:10.116 --> 00:51:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've really
inspired millions of people

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so grateful
that you've been here

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:84%
to share your story with
us from a perspective

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.070 align:middle line:84%
that I can understand from being
in this experience as well.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It is such a privilege
to talk with you.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Thank you.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thank you so much.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have many,
many more teachings that

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.600 align:middle line:90%
are in the book.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And do you have another
book coming out as well?

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.067 align:middle line:84%
>> MOORJANI: I have one
that I'm writing right now.

00:51:35.067 --> 00:51:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Good.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:90%
You got a lot to say.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Anita.

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Thank you, Lisa.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It was so easy to talk to you
because I know you get it.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.511 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I do.

00:51:46.511 --> 00:51:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And so much more came
out of the conversation

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.740 align:middle line:90%
because of that understanding.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.202 align:middle line:90%
We started from another level.

00:51:52.202 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MOORJANI: Yes.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So, thank you so much.

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.127 align:middle line:10%
