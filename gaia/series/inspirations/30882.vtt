00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:10%
In 1997, "The Four Agreements"
was written by Toltec Shaman,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Don Miguel Ruiz, and spent
seven years on the New

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
York Times bestseller list.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm very honored
to be joined by Don Miguel

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Ruiz and his son,
Don Miguel Ruiz, Jr.,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to share the wisdom of the
centuries-old Toltec tradition

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
that serves as a guide to an
individual's personal freedom.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:10%
Don Miguel Jr. actually
has a new book out called,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:10%
"The Five Levels of Attachment
: Toltec Wisdom for the Modern

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:10%
World", which explores the
concept of how our attachments

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:10%
have created our reality.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, both
of you, for being here.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.677 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for having us.

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a great honor.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the honor is mine.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a big pressure to
be on this with your show.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Well I love learning
from you, and I've

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed your book so much.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to start
with you, actually,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Don Miguel Sr. When you were
raised, where were you raised?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%
In what area?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:10%
Well I grew up in Tijuana.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:10%
Even that-- I was born in
Guadalajara, but legally

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:10%
I am from Tijuana.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I was raised until
I was 13, 14 years old.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we moved to Mexico City
where my brothers were studying

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:90%
for-- to be medical doctors.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I also
became a medical doctor,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
just following their guide.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
You've-- I heard you refer
to yourself once as Dr.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Ruiz and you were a
neurosurgeon, or--

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.405 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:90%
How many years?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's-- it's hard
to really remember.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I practice to
surgery with my brothers

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
like for four or five years,
maybe then six years .

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of my brothers
is a neurosurgeon,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and the other is an
oncologist associate.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.057 align:middle line:84%
Then I was part of
their team, which

00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
means that I did a
lot of neurosurgeries

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:90%
with my brother, Carlos.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that about you.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
raised, you were raised

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
with the Toltec tradition.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, I think the
modern family has lost a lot

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
of tradition, here in the US.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
What ways did you remember
as meaningful in your life,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
when you were raised?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well mainly, it's
about respect.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I see how my parents treat each
other with a lot of respect.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
How they treat the children
with a lot of respect.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And also how they treat
the rest of their relatives

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and their friends
with a lot of respect.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course everybody
respects them, like everybody

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:90%
call my father Don Ruiz.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
respect for my father

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
that people-- that people have.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:90%
That is-- I love.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And now how did you
transfer that on when

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:90%
you're raising your children?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Your son, and you
have-- we actually have

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
a picture of your two sons.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
There's actually three
sons that you have,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.965 align:middle line:90%
Don Miguel, Don Jose--

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And Leo.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And Leo.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
raise your children?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.585 align:middle line:84%
Well, we never planned
how to raise the children.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
When I have my-- my first child,
I had no experience at all.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Then it's about the action.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's about
how we love them.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember having Miguel in my
hands when finally he was born.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I take him out,
there was a full moon,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and I offered him to the moon.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I say, he's alive.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And he will go around the
world, sharing himself.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And have you raised--
now you have two

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.719 align:middle line:84%
children as well, don't you?
-Yes.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I have my son, Alejandro,
and my little girl, Audrey.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:90%
They're both seven and five.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's nice.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, like that story
that my father was telling me.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Like when I held my son
for the very first time,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
a huge realization came upon me.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:90%
No idea.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, it dawned on me

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that he has no idea what
he has been doing for,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:90%
what, at the time, 30 years?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:90%
We would play it by ear.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
The thing about raising a child
is that we grab from what we

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
know, from our family, from
our friends, from everyone's

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:90%
giving us advice.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And we use what we apply.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do we impose
an image onto our kids?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Or do I engage my
child, and my child

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%
tells me what he or she needs?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, that's how I've
really learned from my dad,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
how to raise my kids
in-- for who they are.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It starts with
accepting who they are,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
to love them for who
they are, and raise

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
them as they-- as they are.
-As they are.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Now did you-- have
a lot of you--

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you are so wonderful
to share so many family

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
photos with us, which I
really, really appreciate.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we get a
glimpse into your lives.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Did you used to take your sons
on a lot of journeys together?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:90%
We have a picture here of you.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.511 align:middle line:84%
I think you were
in a-- in a cave.

00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I just come in my
memory something

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:90%
that I really like a lot.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The first time that I have his
son, Alejandro, in my hands,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and I say, wow, he is--
he is so beautiful.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I put him in his
hand and say, now--

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
You remember that.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean,
domesticate him?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, when my dad taught me
that-- because in "The Four

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Agreements", he talks about
letting go of domestication.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he went to
me and says, Miguel,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:90%
domesticated your child.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
he told me that

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:84%
is because, if I'm not going
to domesticate my child,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
someone else will.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:90%
But the question is, how?

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Life teaches us, or domesticates
us in its own way, which

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
is called action-reaction.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.042 align:middle line:84%
For every action
we take, there is

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
a consequence, and a reaction.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
This is how life teaches
us from our mistakes,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:90%
from our-- how we learn.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And we build from that.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the domestication
my father talks

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
about in "The Four
Agreements", and throughout,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:90%
is based on conditional love.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
A system of reward and
punishment for everything--

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:84%
if we do something right, the
reward is our own acceptance.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If we do something wrong,
the punishment is rejection.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Since we're emotional
beings, that acceptance

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
feels like love.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
If we do it wrong,
that rejection

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
feels like the opposite.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about domestication

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:90%
through conditional love.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So when my father's telling
me, domesticate your child,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
he's telling me, engage and
teach them how to live in life.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Do it in your own way,
but always become aware

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that how I do it, do I do
it with conditional love,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
or unconditional, which is
accepting him for who he is.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So still allow him to
make his own mistakes,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
fall on his knees,
do whatever he

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
needs to do to learn self-love,
but yet, be there as a support.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah because--

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.529 align:middle line:84%
-Not do it for him.
-Exactly.

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the world around him--
and I know this for a fact,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because I had him as a father--
but I still was domesticated.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I still fell into conditional
love through my friends,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
through our school,
through pop culture,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
through my-- you know,
like I-- I remember

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:90%
my rebellion with my family.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.455 align:middle line:84%
Having the juxtaposition
of love between my father,

00:07:38.455 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and my grandmother, my
mother, and my cousins,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and then having the conditional
acceptance of friends.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, and with our
friends in high school--

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use an
example of junior high

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
because the reward for
living up the expectation

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
is popularity, acceptance.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
If you do not, then you're
a square, you're a nerd,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you're a geek, and
you're chastised.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically, without
separation, the world

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
out there is ready to
domesticate us according

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:90%
to its own conditions.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, are-- is there

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:90%
going to be a counterbalance?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my father's and
my grandmother's teaching

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%
was that counterbalance.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
being the eldest,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I also got to witness my
own father's transformation.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember the man before
he started his journey.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember the man
who was still doctor.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I remember as
a six-year-old,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and a seven-year-old, and
an eight-year-old, that guy.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:90%
Then he began his journey.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember the day when he
let go of medicine, my mom's

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
reaction, my grandma's
reaction, everyone's reaction,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and-- and you're
going to go do what?

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.391 align:middle line:84%
So did it register
to you as fear?

00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Change?

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, yes,
because it was everything--

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:90%
the whole world shifted for us.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, at
a-- watching his transition,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
watching his movement,
all of a sudden

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to witness
something incredible,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
which is the blossoming of this
man, right here, right now.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, having that
combination of how

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
my dad domesticated
me in my own life,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
going from conditional
domestication

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid,
like eight-years-old,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
seven-years-old,
then watching him,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout my
teenage years, shift.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And then watching him, because
I was already in my late teens

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
or 20s when he became a
master, and how he domesticated

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and educated my younger
brother, in particular, Leo,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
how that bridge was different.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And watching that for
myself, especially as I'm

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
raising my own kid, allows
me the juxtaposition

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:90%
of those two things.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Now when you went
through that time

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and that period of rebellion.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Was that your journey,
in order to see

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
what was-- what the difference
was out there, in the world?

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of what
you're talking about--

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:90%
 --about domestication.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Is to go out through
your own hero's journey

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
or to go out through
your own, but up against,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
where do I begin and
the world begins?

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.915 align:middle line:90%
Or end, and the world begins?

00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:11.061 align:middle line:84%
We start to make
those directions.

00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can say that if--
if there's anything that's

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:84%
different from me growing
up in this family,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to anyone else,
something I never realized,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
until just recently,
is that having grown up

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
with the teachings,
having grown up with this,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I use the teachings
to domesticate me.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I ended up using these teachings
as my own conditioning.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine using, be
impeccable with the word,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
always doing your best,
don't make assumptions--

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
You were raised with that.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
 --don't take
things personally.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But instead of seeing it as the
instruments of transformation

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that they are, I saw it as my
father telling me what to do.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
"The Four Agreements"
came out in 1997,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and when I started
reading it, it was

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:90%
my dad telling me what to do.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I put it down, because
to me, it was speaking

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:90%
to me as my father, to son.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
As I grew older, and
I began to really go--

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess you were saying my
hero's journey, my own life,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
everything began to shift.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Something in my life
happened, and all of a sudden,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I reached out and
I grabbed the book,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and I saw it the way a
lot of people in the world

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
saw it, as instruments
for transformation.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I saw it from a
totally different way.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I had this
image of what I had--

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to live up to.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.285 align:middle line:84%
This p-- this pedestal, I am
the son of Don Miguel Ruiz,

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and I have to live up
to this expectation.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
All-- all the while, I'm using
this false image to justify,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and my conditional
love for myself.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I domesticated myself anyways.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
That is-- now when you were
going through that transition,

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
from the medical doctor
into being a Shaman, and now

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] as you--
as you've taught me,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
what was your transition about?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Why did you go through
that transition?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did you leave medicine
the way that you knew it?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, like a-- it's
easy to understand

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was more interested
in understanding

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%
how the human mind works.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And by exploring
the human mind, I

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
was transforming myself, also.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was your own inner
journey that caused it.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It starts shifting,
because, like we say,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:90%
practice makes the master.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Then, when everybody was
reflecting in me, whatever

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
their problems they
have in their life,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
then as soon as I
give them solutions,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I see the solutions
for myself, also.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I-- I was shifting,
shifting, shifting,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
until the moment that everyone--
everything was so clear for me.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
To see the human mind
is like an open book,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and is a very predictable.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we all are the same,
but only little things change.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you can see, more or
less, the future of a person,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
if you see the mistakes that
they're making right now.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Explain.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say that you start

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:90%
eating hamburgers every day.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And you start gaining
weight, and gaining weight.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
in certain time,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have a heart attack.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So the mistakes
that I'm making now

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:90%
will be the demise of my future.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But if at a certain moment,
you have the awareness,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and say, uh oh, I
will watch what I eat,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:90%
then the future will change.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It's that discipline
that you're talking about.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
That self disciplined,
very important in--

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
But we need the awareness.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Because without awareness,
you cannot make changes.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:10%
You can almost say it's
like that aha moment.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.369 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:10%
Like-- in continuing
that image that my dad

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:10%
was using with hamburgers.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And one moment, out of the blue,
you realize what you're doing.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing the truth of the
consequence of our actions.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
At one point, when we see
that rec-- recognition,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and see the results of
it, we have a choice.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Do I continue to eat
this way, or do I

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
make the choice and I shift.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
You've-- you really are
describing a little bit

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of the hero's
journey of what you

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
have went through when you made
your transition from medicine.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was still carried
on through your-- your life,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
it was a beginning.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:84%
That you went to this
change and this shift.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You did, as well, went
through this shift.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.041 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the human mind
to go through that journey,

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
isn't it?
-Oh, definitely.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But first you need
to have awareness.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you never will--
the shift will not happen,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
but the transformation
took on anyway.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
For as long as we live,
life continues to move,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and as we go through
life, we learn.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are we paying
attention, or we're not?

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Like he said, it depends
on your yes and your no's.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Your yes and your no's?

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Your yes and your no's
Like-- with every yes

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I do, for example,
with every yes I say,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:90%
something will be done.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I will be able to
manifest something.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
With every no I give,
something won't be done.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So yes and my no
becomes the instruments

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
of my transformation.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
We can simply say,
the instruments

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
by which I construct the dream
of my life, my masterpiece.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
in my belief system

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't say yes to.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Even the no's or the
negatives in my mind,

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.597 align:middle line:84%
at the very root of
it, there's a yes.

00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice, right?

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:90%
In my life-- yes, a choice.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an engagement.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
You can say that that's
how the world functions.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, if we
go outside of our home,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and we look around
the neighborhood,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
we see the buildings that we,
as a community, said yes to.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
What we don't see are the
buildings we, as a community,

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
said no to.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Our yes creates, and
our no's doesn't.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So at our personal level, as
the individual, what I manifest

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
is the expression of
my yes, my intent.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
What I don't manifest is the
manifestation of my intent

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
as well, which is, I don't put
my energy in creating that.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
You can say this is
how I move my body.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between me
and this an inanimate object.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I have this intents by
which I can live life,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and I choose how I construct
it, how I move it, how I shift.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Even now, I'm putting
air into my diaphragm,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:90%
slowly letting it out.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:84%
The vocal cords in my throat,
the muscles in my mouth,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
play together to express
an idea, in a language.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
This is me, intent,
expressing, saying, yes.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I control it.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
interact with the world.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And if I respect my yes and my
no, I'm able to respect yours.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And between each
other's respect,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:90%
we build the dream of us.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
So every action that
you make is a choice.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
That makes you a lot more
accountable in life, actually.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:90%
That really does.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So with that the
basis of the book

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.381 align:middle line:84%
"The Five Levels of Attachment"?
-Yes.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Tell me--

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You can say that
that's exactly it.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother,
my first teacher,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
taught me this
question, which is

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:90%
the driving force of the book.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
beautiful picture of your--

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's my
beautiful grandma.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Your grandmother.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And Don Miguel,
your dad, and your--

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.149 align:middle line:84%
-My son, Alejandro.
-Your son, Alejandro.

00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:90%
He's just a few months old.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.241 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful.
It's a--

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
- --a very personal picture.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate, and that is
three generations right there.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And the lesson that she asked
me is, do I control knowledge

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:90%
or does knowledge control me?

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
If we use the example of,
if I control my yes and no,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
then I can use my knowledge
to be the instrument

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
by which I navigate the world.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Because my knowledge allows
me to understand the world,

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:84%
allows me to see the world,
and for me to understand it.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If I'm so attached to knowledge,
knowledge now forces my hand,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and controls my yes,
and controls my no.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So throughout the
levels of attachment,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you can say Level One,
The Authentic Self.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The answer to the question,
do I control knowledge or does

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
knowledge control me,
is that I am life,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what
I know, I am a life.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I am this body.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I am here.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So that is knowledge
controlling you?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:84%
That's me
controlling knowledge.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, it's me
recognizing that I am life,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and that knowledge
exists because I exist.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Every single thought in my
mind, every single belief

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that I have, has power because
I get that power with my life.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So at Level Two, Preference, the
ability that I still recognize

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and, answering the question is,
I recognize that I am a life,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
yet I'm going to
engage the world.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Using knowledge, I'm going
to attach, invest in myself,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and detach when the moment
is no longer present.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:90%
When the moment has passed.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.275 align:middle line:84%
So I will use knowledge as an
instrument by which I function.

00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
At Level Three, Identity, I use
knowledge to identify myself.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You could say that this is the
beginning, or the mid-round,

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
where knowledge and
I are intertwined.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And everything I
know describes me.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You can be in the direction of
my preference, or in my choices

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
in life, but at Level
Four, Internalization,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I use knowledge to
give me the rules

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of my own self-acceptance.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It gives me the rules of
how I should live my life.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Basically, domestication.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
This is when
domestication comes in,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and the conditions of
my own self-acceptance

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
really given in the
form of my knowledge.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, knowledge is
starting to control my actions.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
In order to be acceptable, by my
own point of view and my peers,

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I have to live up
to what I know.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Like you had done
when you were a child.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Level Five, Fanaticism.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm so attached to knowledge
that knowledge controls my

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:90%
every action, without a doubt.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the distortion of
knowledge, because now,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
where knowledge no longer
reflects life as is.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the function
of knowledge

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is for us to
understand the world,

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to understand each other.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm so
attached to knowledge,

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
my personal importance, my
ego, will distort what I see,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and I can force it to fit
what I want it to see,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and reject anything else.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the rigidness, you
can say, to the point

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
where, an idea is more
important than my own life.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.881 align:middle line:84%
You talked about that a little
bit in "The Four Agreements",

00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
About the attachment
to-- to knowledge,

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but it was described as-- as
don't take anything personally.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that where it was described?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I say,
don't make assumptions--

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't make assumptions.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:84%
 --even deeper into
what knowledge is,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and what I say is that, when we
were born, we had no knowledge.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
We create knowledge, and then
when we give our personal power

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to knowledge, and
knowledge becomes

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:90%
the biggest tyrant in our life.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge
creates our identity.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:90%
What we believe we are.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So do you live
without knowledge, now?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I use knowledge.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise I cannot speak to you.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Then knowledge follows
whatever duration I want to go.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But you're detached from
it, at the same time, right?

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
 --the things,
like could say that

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a separation between
me, life, and knowledge.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Because what is knowledge?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is a
symbol that allows

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
us to understand the world.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You can say that it
allows us to comprehend

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:90%
how the universe works.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
comprehend each other,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and through that we make the
agreements by which we create

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:90%
this society, this culture.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything around this
city, in Los Angeles,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:90%
was created by a yes and a no.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
knowledge is that it's

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:90%
subjugate to an agreement.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
You can say even a
word, its definition

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
is completely subjugate
to a community's agreement

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of what that word means.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, everything we
know, every single concept,

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is an expression of
the agreements of us,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
as the dreams-- as human
beings coming together,

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
saying this is what
this word means.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I can say, this is a
sofa, this is a shirt,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's things that
aren't tangible like that.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:90%
There's love, there's justice.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So its definition is how we
allow ourselves to comprehend.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have
something that changeable,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
it's not really set, because
an agreement can always change.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Well like we see in this
picture, with your dad,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
with your son,
and he's-- are you

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.631 align:middle line:84%
imparting knowledge unto
your-- to your grandson

00:23:57.631 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:90%
in this picture?

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.776 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're talking
about, is that intangible

00:24:00.776 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:90%
knowledge?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I am loving
him unconditionally.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like a-- if you
want to learn any language,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:84%
you take this object, you
don't know how to say it,

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and someone come and say vaso.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.689 align:middle line:84%
-Vaso.
-Vaso.

00:24:28.689 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Now it's an agreement.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:90%
That is now vaso.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Now it's vaso.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in English, it's glass.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:90%
In Spanish, it's vaso.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Now if you get it right,
you get the reward.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Yay. [CLAPPING]

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:90%
And if you get to wrong, oh no.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Try again.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's, see my lips, vaso.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.802 align:middle line:90%
Vaso.

00:24:52.802 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Vaso.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Yay. [CLAPPING]

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Every single part of
knowledge is an agreement.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It's still difficult to
learn a new language.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Then when you see a child
try to learn a language,

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll see them make
a lot of mistakes.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:90%
It is so funny to see them--

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's so beautiful,
because that's

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:90%
how they relate to the world.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Things have labels and
words attached to them,

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
whereas they didn't have
that 2,500 years ago.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Then they know that
this is a glass.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It is part of his knowledge.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Which is when my father
says, domesticate him,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
this is exactly what
he's talking about.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Educate your child
and let them see it.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Now the question is, how?

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Because, as simple
as that was, there

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:90%
sometimes goes to the extremes.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
With every punishment,
oh, you're-- you can

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:90%
see I could be very abusive.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I can punish him
with so much thing,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and I can fill him
with guilt, with shame,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:90%
with all these self-doubts.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
acquire our knowledge.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:90%
The question is, how?

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And an attachment, if you
can see how our knowledge is

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
completely subjugate
to an agreement

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and can change at
any given moment,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
an attachment is when we bring
something that's foreign,

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:90%
and we make it part of us.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
We bring it in.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
happens when we get attached

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is, we don't want it to change.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if it changes,
what does it say about me?

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So we attach ourselves to our
knowledge, and when we do that,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
one of the worst things that
can happen is for it to change.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's wrong, what
does that say about me?

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's right, well then I'm
better than everyone else.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
that's the war

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our society.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Who can domesticate who?

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Who can impose their
will on to someone,

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and who's going to subjugate?

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
When you have two people trying
to impose onto each other,

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:90%
we have conflict.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to domesticate
until someone gives in?

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Well for the example of your
grandmother, your mother.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
When she taught you
traditional ways-- and we

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
have a picture of her in a
wonderful, traditional outfit.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
How do you take that
knowledge that she taught you,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and use that to guide you,
and also, at the same time,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:90%
let it go?

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:90%
How do you detach from it?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the thing about it
is, one, the way my grandmother

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
taught-- this is the same
thing as my dad-- by action.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
You can say, let's
use an example

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that, when she began to teach
me was through translation.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I had to translate
for her because she

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:90%
didn't speak any English.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
So she only spoke Spanish.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So I had to speak for--
translate for her.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes she
would get inspired,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.922 align:middle line:84%
and she'd just go off, and
I have to try to catch up.

00:27:47.922 --> 00:27:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to
everything she was saying,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and I was processing
everything she

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
was saying, that
eventually I wasn't

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:90%
listening to her anymore.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to my
own mind, processing it.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
When my grandma
asked me, why do you

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
think you're having
so many problems

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.350 align:middle line:90%
with translating my words?

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's because
you're not giving

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%
me a chance to translate.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You're going too fast.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, are
you using knowledge,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:90%
or is knowledge using you?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Meaning by that, are you
listening to life, which

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is my voice, or
are you listening

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to your mind, which is
telling you how it should be.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
paying attention

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to your mind of
how it should be,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
then you're no longer
listening to me.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:90%
She's a very wise woman.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:84%
She said, imagine
doing that to life.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You live life and you
process everything,

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're completely
contemplating everything

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:84%
so much that life
continues to move on,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and you've got behind on
something of what happened,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to understand it.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
listening to life.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're going to
impose what you know onto life,

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're no longer
going to see it.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:90%
She told me, learn to listen.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that my voice
is the first thing

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
you hear in your mind,
and open your mouth,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and say it in English.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I was able to actually
get to the point

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
where, as she began to use the
first letters of each word,

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I was already translating it.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
She is such a wise woman,
and this picture is such

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful picture of her.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way she
taught me how to meditate,

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
how to quiet the mind, how to
quiet everything around me.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I had to completely
shut everything around me

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and listen.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:84%
This was her way of
teaching me how to meditate.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Something that, as I was a
young, I didn't understand.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment of transition
in my life, all of a sudden

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
it dawned on me, that
that's what I'm doing.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm projecting onto the world.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I have my own narrators
in my own mind, the voice

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of my knowledge, in the
form of my thoughts,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
describing everything of
how the world should be.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And life is what it is.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm fighting the world,
as this is how it should be,

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going in complete
disharmony with the world,

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
paying attention.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Is-- is your life a
walking meditation?

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you live in this
beautiful space of your heart

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.701 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have moments to take
you out of that, Don Miguel?

00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's very rare for sure.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.819 align:middle line:84%
Mikey?
-For him?

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it rare?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:90%
That he has--

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Moments that takes him-- takes
him out of his heart space?

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I would say, there are
moments where, when he's tired

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and he's sleepy, when his
awareness is kind of a weak,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes, you know
like any-- any person who

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:90%
gets tired, gets cranky.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
There's some moments like that.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was one of
the things in life,

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:84%
if he-- Let's imagine
awareness like a flower.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:84%
When we're completely open,
and we, all of a sudden,

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:84%
we get attached, and
sometimes life happens,

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:90%
our awareness closes.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And as we get attached,
this is the only way.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, we have
that aha moment in our life.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we
realize we're tired,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
or we realize that we're
hungry, or we realize that we're

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:84%
attaching-- translating the
world, we have that aha moment

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and we have a choice.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:84%
We can either stay in
that space of anger,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
or frustration, or whatever
that is, attachment,

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.210 align:middle line:90%
and we begin to let go.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because things don't
always go your way.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, flights
aren't always on time.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And there's schedules that
get changed, and turned

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.380 align:middle line:10%
upside down, and so forth.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:10%
How do you handle that?

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, when you become
fluid as-- as to water,

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:10%
everything becomes
extremely easy.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:10%
You see an obstacle, you
don't face the obstacle,

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:10%
you go around.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And you go for the goal
that you want to reach.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you-- let's say that
you intend to get something.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how
you're going to get it,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
but for sure you're
going to get it.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because life will bring
many different events

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that can distract you and try
to take you to another place.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe sometimes when
you're in another place,

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you find out that this is
not exactly what you wanted.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you will take you for
what you really wanted.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.370 align:middle line:84%
That it-- but you need
to be fluid, instead

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:90%
of having the resistance.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It-- that happen when you
master transformation.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.123 align:middle line:90%
You become that fluid.

00:32:20.123 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:84%
You do an enormous amount
of travel, and in your life,

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
you have lineages that
go to 116 years old.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a wonderful
longevity in your family.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But you are still in a
vigorous travel schedule,

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and you still both travel
all over the world.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:84%
How is it that you practice The
Four Agreements in your life?

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I will ask you.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't even think about it.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.786 align:middle line:90%
It's just what I am.

00:32:49.786 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I will-- I never would
think, oh, I will take things

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
personally or not, I
would take something

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and going to make assumptions.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.290 align:middle line:84%
No, it's-- I'm
just whatever I am.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, many
people ask me, OK,

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Miguel, what is what you are?

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can use knowledge in
order to justify my existance.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:90%
But it will be a lie.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is that
I have no idea what I am.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I am, and it's
not relevant to know what I am.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
You could almost
say that my identity

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
as an empty definition who's
subject to my own agreement.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Whatever I say yes.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Because an identity would be
an attachment to who you are,

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
If I'm completely aware
that I'm the one saying yes,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that it's my agreement,
then at any given moment,

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I can say, no.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:90%
I can change it.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
You can say-- let's use the
example of The Four Agreements

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:84%
as the four conditions,
the way I was talking about

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:90%
earlier, when I was growing up.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.880 align:middle line:84%
How do I detach
myself from that?

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I apply the Five
Levels of Attachment,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that
I'm at Level Four.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not completely
at Level Five,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:84%
otherwise I'm fighting
with everyone.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But I recognize
that's what I'm doing.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
transformation it start--

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:90%
you can see it two ways.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I can transform because I
have to, in order to live up

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to an expectation,
which basically,

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm repeating the concept
of cycle of domestication.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Or I see it from a
totally different way.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Transformation, from
the point of view,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I accept myself for who I
am, at this very moment,

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:90%
attachment and all.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I attach my-- I
accept that I'm not

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:90%
being impeccable with my word.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I accept that I'm not being--
I'm taking things personally.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I accept that I'm
not doing my best.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
This is who I am at
this very moment.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
At this very moment,
I can make a choice.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
I can continue to do this, and
be at this level of attachment,

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
or I could say, I'm
going to change.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Not because I have to,
but because I want to.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What about when other people
in your circle are attached,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and are in that place?

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's actually
a very great thing

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
because one of the realizations
about transformation,

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
at least from my point of view,
is recognizing one great truth.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm only responsible for myself.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
The power over anyone
ends at the fingertip

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:90%
of my-- of my finger.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I have no power over my dad.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I have no power over you.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have
power over anyone.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The thing about it is
that, at that moment,

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the only person
I am really responsible for

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:90%
is me.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I take care of my kids
because I love them,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and I've decided to engage
in being a father with them.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't want to be a
father, I could leave them.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be a father,
so I'm going to engage.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
With that being said,
in my saying yes,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:84%
in me approaching and reaching,
allows me to completely take

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
full responsibility and take
on the power that is me,

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.650 align:middle line:90%
my intent.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
When I decide to
transform, when I

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
decide to let go
of an attachment,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I break the cycle
of domestication.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I do things because I

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:84%
recognize that my yes is
what is driving me to create.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:90%
My intent, my free will.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I say no, it's
because I want to say no.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And I accept myself, both
the good, I accept the bad.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I accept the ugly.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I accept myself as perfect,
because I am a life, not

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
because I'm perfect,
according to the judge,

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:90%
or what I'm supposed to be.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply perfect
because I'm alive,

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and as long as I'm alive,
I can evolve and change.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because life evolves and
changes continuously.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Now you said yes in many
different ways in your life,

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to teaching, to-- to
inspiring many, many people.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You also, I understand,
in December of last year,

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:84%
you had a wonderful trip that
you took with a lot of people

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:84%
around the ending of
the Mayan calendar.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us a little
bit about that experience?

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, a calendar, it
was made just to measure time.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Not to make prophecies.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
we need to understand.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.095 align:middle line:90%
We love to measure time.

00:37:27.095 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Many people use calendars in
order to create prophecies.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the ones
who create the calendar,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but other people who
use it to prophesize

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:90%
in-- by-- with the Mayans.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:54.450 align:middle line:84%
They prophesize the
end of the world.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Which is great.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's wonderful,
but not the-- the way

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that people take it.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:90%
The end of the world--

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean?

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It means, depending who
is-- who it's talking about.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the mystery schools,
you know, like the Assyrians,

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
the-- the-- the Egyptians, the
Greeks, the Toltecs, the ones

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
who are prepared for
that, the highest point

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:90%
is the end of the world.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But the world is the
one that we create.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It's our creation.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It's our own mind.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the story of our self.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.840 align:middle line:90%
This is our world.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And every human
creates his own world.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the end
of the planet earth.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the
end of humanity.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:90%
It means the end of the world.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Our world.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.664 align:middle line:84%
You can say-- you
can say-- you can

00:38:58.664 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:84%
it in this way, like,
there's a description called

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the individual dream and
the dream of the planet.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
world, we're talking

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:90%
about the individual dream.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:84%
The mind's job is to dream,
to perceive, and to project.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
understand as dreaming.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:90%
We dream in a physical matter.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We dream when we're
asleep, and we daydream.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the constant
point between the two.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
What is the personal,
individual dream?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's expressing something
my dad always says.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.031 align:middle line:84%
If I'm the one talking in
my mind, who's listening?

00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Me.
I'm listening.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I'm the one
listening, who is talking?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.618 align:middle line:90%
Me.

00:39:38.618 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:84%
In [INAUDIBLE] we
see the relationship

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:90%
between mind, body, and spirit.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The relationship between me,
life, and my mind, knowledge.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.725 align:middle line:84%
You can almost say, that's
exactly what knowledge is.

00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Back to knowledge.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is the construction
of everything I believe,

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and I've said yes, and
forms my belief system.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
definition right there.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So basically when my dad says,
it's the end of the world,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.710 align:middle line:84%
it's that moment when we
become aware that my world,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:14.170 align:middle line:84%
what I know, is completely
subjugated to my will, which

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:90%
is my yes.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything I know, every belief.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.950 align:middle line:84%
When I recognize the separation
between me, mind, and me,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.750 align:middle line:84%
life, just like the
expression, I am not this body,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm also not this mind.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:84%
At the very moment, a cycle
ends and a new one begins.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the people
experienced that came

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:90%
with you to the journey?

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we have wonderful
pictures of your experience

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:90%
in Teotihuacan?

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:90%
In Teotihuacan, yes.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, and you
took a group of people

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
there right around the
time of the prophesied end

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan calendar.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Which I understand now,
prophecy is up to each

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of the person's opinion.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:90%
As many prophecies are.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So the group that
you took there, I

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
know it was a huge celebration,
because I got to broadcast

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.090 align:middle line:84%
live from there, which was
the-- you looked like you

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
were having the best time.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
-Tell me--

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:90%
It was cold, but it was good.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what this picture is?

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:84%
This is an amazing shot
of you at the base of one

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan pyramids,
is that right?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid of the Sun.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:90%
That's me and my cousin.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting
at the very bottom

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:84%
of The Pyramid of the Sun,
celebrating a transition.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.135 align:middle line:84%
And this was on the
21st of December, 2012?

00:41:29.135 --> 00:41:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes. -Right around that time?

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And now here's an overhead
shot of the pyramid, where

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
you're sitting at the steps of.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this,
Don Miguel, Sr.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Well there's something
that I'd never

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.448 align:middle line:84%
seen in the-- in the--
archaeological books

00:41:53.448 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:90%
but it has the shape of a human.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The stairs makes a
shape of a human.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
You can see in there--
in the-- in the bottom,

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
the little square that
looks like a head.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Beside that, you'll see the
stairs in both directions that

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.390 align:middle line:90%
looks like arms.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Then coming out to
the pyramid, you'll

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:26.000 align:middle line:84%
see the big stairs that have
the shape of a-- of a body.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Then keep going up, you'll see
a couple of stairs that are

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:90%
parallel and looks like legs.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And the last stairs that go
to the top of the pyramid,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:84%
it's only one and looks
like a piece of wood.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Then beside of the head, you can
see like a piece of wood, also.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Like arms stretched out.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like the
Christ on the-- on the cross

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.512 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of his death.

00:42:54.512 --> 00:42:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Now did you realize that
when you were standing

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:90%
on top of this pyramid?

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:84%
You looked down and you saw
the embodiment of Christ

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.160 align:middle line:90%
on the cross?

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, I see a--

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:90%
An image.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I see the similitude
of the Christ

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:13.450 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of the stairs,
but it was built 500 years

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.990 align:middle line:90%
before the birth of Jesus.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But the meaning,
because it's a symbol,

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the meaning is-- it
symbolized the-- the shape

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of a human who is at the
very top of a pyramid,

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:90%
reaching in the sun.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And what-- what looks like
an aura, is the sun itself.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the shape of the sun.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Was-- do you think
it was intentionally

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.011 align:middle line:84%
designed that way?
-Definitely.

00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:41.300 align:middle line:84%
-Definitely.
-Yes.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to represent
an individual ascending.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.530 align:middle line:84%
You know that moment where we
have that moment of a cycle.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:84%
When we talked about
the end of the cycle,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:84%
when we recognize that
I am not the mind,

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.370 align:middle line:84%
it also represents the beginning
of a new way of seeing life.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.210 align:middle line:90%
A moment of awareness.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This moment, it represents
that moment of transcendence,

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.420 align:middle line:84%
where all of a sudden,
I am completely

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
aware that I'm alive, and
I am in constant communion.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We can say that it looks
like the figure of Christ,

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.010 align:middle line:84%
because we're familiar
with that figure,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:84%
so project that image
onto that, because that's

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:90%
what we recognize.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Especially if we grew up with
that beautiful tradition.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's meant to
represent almost

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:84%
the same thing,
which is basically,

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.655 align:middle line:84%
that moment of
ascension, of divinity.

00:44:27.655 --> 00:44:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And for us, in our
tradition, is that moment

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
where we become alive.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:38.330 align:middle line:84%
That we're completely aware
that I am in control of my yes.

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.430 align:middle line:84%
That, in my brief system,
there is nothing in my mind

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I said no.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you suppose that these
were the teachings 500

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:84%
years before Christ, when
these pyramids were built?

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have a picture
of-- of the pyramids.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Well you could say that,
because I-- I wasn't alive

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.760 align:middle line:84%
when that, so anything
I can say from that time

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.430 align:middle line:84%
is basically a story,
or something I've read.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.190 align:middle line:90%
But it makes sense.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's a beautiful story to
tell, because it makes sense.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the
beautiful thing about

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:84%
our tradition is that
it's an oral tradition.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Every generation tells it in
a way that makes sense to us.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You can even say with my
father-- like one of the things

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that he did-- there's
two books in particular.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
A book called-- by Mary Carroll
Nelson called, "Beyond Fear",

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and "The Four Agreements."

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
In "Beyond Fear", he talks
a lot about the Teotihuacan

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Tezcatlipoca plain.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:84%
He talked a lot about
that old Shaman tradition.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But my father found
that a lot of people

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.790 align:middle line:84%
were becoming fanatical
about that kind of teaching,

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.900 align:middle line:90%
so he shifted the teaching.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:84%
He let's go of a lot
of that symbology,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and just stripped it
down to a language

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that's common sense, at least
to my father's point of view.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And The Four
Agreements were born.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can say
that each generation

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.380 align:middle line:90%
shares it in his own way.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.820 align:middle line:84%
If Don Ezekiel was
around and teaching us,

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.090 align:middle line:84%
he was say-- he would speak to
us in the language in the 1800s

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the 1900s.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Something that was
relevant in their own life.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Don [INAUDIBLE],
which is his son,

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:84%
teach-- taught it
in his own way.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.600 align:middle line:84%
When my grandmother
began to teach it,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.950 align:middle line:84%
it was dramatically different
from that of Don Ezekiel.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And by the time my
dad grabbed it, it

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.160 align:middle line:90%
was incredibly different, one.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in English,
but also because he's

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:84%
speaking to a whole
different audience.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And when me and my
brother teacher it,

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:84%
it's even dramatically
different from me

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.234 align:middle line:84%
and Jose, because we all
interpret it different.

00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:38.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's passed down.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because, at
the essence of the tradition,

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.740 align:middle line:90%
there's a lesson of life.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination
of life teaching us,

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
teachings that allows

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:90%
us to function in that world.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Yet life will still approach us.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.570 align:middle line:84%
As for example, the
story of "The Five Levels

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of Attachment", if I put it
my-- in the old Toltec language,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.140 align:middle line:84%
it is the story of Tezcatlipoca,
the Smoking Mirror.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:84%
If I use the example
of the question of,

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
as I increase my
level of attachment

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.270 align:middle line:84%
to a point where I can't see
anything but the illusion,

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:20.090 align:middle line:84%
but my attachment, in the
story of Tezcatlipoca,

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
if I do it backwards, going
from Level Five to Level One,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:31.260 align:middle line:84%
the image of Tezcatlipoca
is, I see nothing but smoke.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even aware that there's
a mirror in front of me.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what Tezcatlipoca
is, the Smoking Mirror.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the reflection
that I can't see,

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
because I have all this
distortion around me.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:84%
To break through the
smoke, I create doubt.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Be skeptical, but
learn to listen.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, the--

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.450 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The smoke begins to clear,
and there is a reflection.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.350 align:middle line:84%
At Level Four, I believe the
reflection to be the truth,

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's giving
me the conditions

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.860 align:middle line:90%
of my own self acceptance.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.020 align:middle line:84%
When i let go of
that, all of a sudden,

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a shift that happens
from Level Four to Level Three.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I no longer need to
distort knowledge

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.440 align:middle line:84%
because I'm no
longer going to use

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:84%
it to give me the conditions
of my own acceptance.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I'm aware
of a clean reflection of life.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I begin to become
aware that I am life,

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and that's reflecting me.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:37.820 align:middle line:84%
At Level Two, I become aware
of the surface of the mirror,

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge, the reflection
is a complete separate thing

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.020 align:middle line:90%
from me in life.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And at Level One, the mirror
disappears, and I am life.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Is-- isn't it wonderful to see
your teachings coming through?

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:84%
All that you've
combined together

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is such a beautiful way
of explaining things.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That was very, very clear
in explaining the levels

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of attachment, and combined--
When you wrote "The Four

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Agreements", I
mean that's why it

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.310 align:middle line:84%
stayed on the bestseller
list for seven years,

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:90%
because it's truth.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for explaining that.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.530 align:middle line:84%
It's based on years
and years of tradition,

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and prophecy in
different languages,

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and that type of truth,
just like the Bible,

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.330 align:middle line:84%
will last for years,
and years, and years.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.400 align:middle line:84%
When-- and people have
different interpretations

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.939 align:middle line:84%
of it, of course.
-Of course.

00:49:24.939 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:10%
And there's different
interpretations

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.920 align:middle line:10%
of my dad's book.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:10%
There's different
interpretations

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.400 align:middle line:10%
of all these
wonderful teachings,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:10%
because, when we're so
attached, we distort

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:10%
it to fit what we already know.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Our own reality, yes.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we're translating
everything into a language

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.750 align:middle line:90%
we can understand.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that translation,
sometimes we

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.030 align:middle line:90%
distort the meaning.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:84%
But if we let the meaning be,
and let knowledge just be what

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.730 align:middle line:84%
it is, knowledge can be a clean
reflection of life, that allows

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.240 align:middle line:90%
us to understand everything.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we let go
of that attachment,

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that disharmony that
exists between us

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.820 align:middle line:84%
will cease to be
there, because I no

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:90%
longer have to defend anything.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I have this free respect
for myself, I can engage you.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Just as I respect
my yes and my no,

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to respect
your yes and no.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
that mutual respect,

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.820 align:middle line:84%
when we construct a dream of
us, it'll be based on harmony.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no longer this war.
-Right.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring these
groups, when you-- Do you all

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:84%
go together when you--
when you bring the groups

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and teach these types of things?
-Sometimes.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and you teach
to-- to entire crowds

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:40.730 align:middle line:90%
when you're teaching.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.399 align:middle line:84%
Both of you?
-Yeah.

00:50:42.399 --> 00:50:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And uniquely as
we are-- as-- yes.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I remember you gave a
talk without words once,

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and I was in the audience.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And for 20 minutes,
you communicated to us

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes, and
with your heart.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And later on, you asked the
audience what you communicated?

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And we, individually, were--
were able to explain exactly

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.580 align:middle line:90%
what it is that you said.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a picture
we have here of you

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.090 align:middle line:84%
doing that, of expressing and
communicating with your eyes.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a really beautiful
way of explaining.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you communicate
with those messages?

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's extremely simple.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.650 align:middle line:84%
First you put knowledge
aside completely.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's just you presence that
comes, and mesh with everyone.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like when
you have your child.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Your child doesn't
know how to speak,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:55.860 align:middle line:84%
but he has that presence, that
just his presence awake in you,

00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:00.540 align:middle line:84%
what you need to do to
communicate with your child.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And they can get it.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.110 align:middle line:90%
They get it completely.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.700 align:middle line:84%
An example is like, my son,
he's high-functioning autistic.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.860 align:middle line:90%
He's a-- he doesn't speak much.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:13.080 align:middle line:84%
He's verbally-- His verbal
skills are very, very minimal.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Yet, him and I
interact all the time.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.380 align:middle line:90%
He lets me know what he needs.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.370 align:middle line:90%
I can imagine, yeah.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
the thing is, when

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I found out about his
condition, at first

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.040 align:middle line:90%
I was totally mourning.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I was so sad, I
was so heartbroken.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I'm
watching him, and he

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.260 align:middle line:84%
comes up and smiles at me, and
then I'm like, what am I doing?

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:84%
What am I being so
sad, and mourning

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.320 align:middle line:90%
my son-- as if I lost my son?

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
I lost the image

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I was projecting onto him.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful moment
is that I allowed myself

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.060 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
see him for who he is,

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and here he is smiling at me.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:53.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no language,
but he's smiling

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.900 align:middle line:84%
at me with those beautiful
eyes, and it says, Daddy.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I have everything I need.
Ah, yes.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't need anything.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And basically I'm
still domesticating

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.360 align:middle line:84%
my child, because I'm
helping him engage the world,

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'm pushing.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's different
than my little girl,

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:84%
because my little girl doesn't
have the same needs as my son.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the father to both,
and I will engage them both,

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:84%
together and individual,
because they're

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:24.220 align:middle line:84%
both individual human beings.
Just like you.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Just like my dad.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Just like anyone.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.300 align:middle line:84%
When I respect everyone's
individuality, that they're

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.850 align:middle line:84%
masters of their own life,
then my ability to engage you

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.335 align:middle line:90%
is by permission.

00:53:36.335 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can't-- I
don't change any one.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.030 align:middle line:90%
I just say my words.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But if someone hears my words,
and they agreed with me,

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:84%
they've given permission to the
words, not me, to the words,

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.634 align:middle line:90%
to impact their life.

00:53:47.634 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
grab it, and they're

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.140 align:middle line:90%
going to run with it.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I-- I think that you
are teaching us a new way

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.900 align:middle line:90%
of communication that way.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And the video that we saw with
you talking with your heart

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:84%
to various people, and just
having your hand on your heart

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is such a great way
of showing us how

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.190 align:middle line:90%
it is possible to communicate.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's pretty much
the future of communication.

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've gone from
speaking, to cell phones,

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to voice mail.

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
telepathic everything.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic voice mail,
telepathic email.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if we really understand
the language of the heart,

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.850 align:middle line:90%
that's the only true language.

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It's existed for thousands,
and thousands of years,

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and will always exist.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It is truly the
language of the heart.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.250 align:middle line:90%
That's why I love your essence.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You come here with
your gratitude,

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.510 align:middle line:84%
with your humbleness, with your
teachings, and your messages,

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but you come with your heart.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the first thing I see.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.370 align:middle line:84%
When I always see you,
I get a hug from both

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of you, which is wonderful.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.700 align:middle line:84%
As this is the first
time I met you,

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and you still gave me a hug.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
you do is that you

00:54:56.290 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:84%
bring your heart into the
conversation before your words.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
an incredible lesson

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:84%
for people to even
learn, is that you

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.810 align:middle line:90%
can communicate without words.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all through that--
the language of the heart.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's the
whole point of all our work.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.795 align:middle line:90%
It's about communication.

00:55:12.795 --> 00:55:15.080 align:middle line:84%
When I first started, I thought
it was going to be something

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.230 align:middle line:90%
about a metaphysical journey.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out, it's
all about the relationships

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.245 align:middle line:90%
I have with the people I love.

00:55:21.245 --> 00:55:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, right now with the--
in the age of the internet,

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.750 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, ignorance
should no longer exist.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But as we get attached,
especially when

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.820 align:middle line:84%
there's so much information, we
only gravitate to what we know.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Because in them-- in a time
where communication is so open,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.490 align:middle line:10%
and we can see the
way other people

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:45.640 align:middle line:10%
dream, the way other people
construct their lives,

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.170 align:middle line:10%
if we allowed ourselves
to listen to one another,

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:10%
we can create such
a beautiful thing.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:55.900 align:middle line:10%
And also at the time, we can see
the flip side, when we get so

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.840 align:middle line:10%
attached, and
everything we believe

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.720 align:middle line:10%
is going to get
challenged, of course

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.810 align:middle line:10%
we're going to cling to it.

00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can see it
happening as we speak.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's so much
about detachment.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you should call this
"The Five Levels of De-- well,

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.780 align:middle line:90%
the second book.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.560 align:middle line:84%
The sequel will be "The
Five Levels of Detachment".

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.230 align:middle line:84%
It's about like,
learning how to detach

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is simply recognizing that,
at any given moment in life,

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.680 align:middle line:84%
a moment passes and
a new one happens.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment of
life, I can say yes,

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and I can change my mind to no.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The power's always in me to
engage and disengage with will,

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:90%
with intent, and with love.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.940 align:middle line:90%
And you, too.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You engage and
disengage all the time.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But you're always
in that heart space.

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I do, I see that.

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've traveled with
you, and I've seen you

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.020 align:middle line:84%
in different
environments, and you

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:54.160 align:middle line:84%
really have that beautiful
space about you, all the time.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.840 align:middle line:84%
In your learning position,
in your teaching position,

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in your quiet time.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.920 align:middle line:84%
You have that beautiful
through-line in your life.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Of-- What a wonderful
mentor your dad

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is to you, and to many,
many, many people.

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so honored to
have you both here,

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.576 align:middle line:84%
and to share your
knowledge with us.

00:57:11.576 --> 00:57:13.644 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
-It's been a big pleasure.

00:57:13.644 --> 00:57:14.710 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure of my own.

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:16.857 align:middle line:90%
The pleasure has been mine.

00:57:16.857 --> 00:57:18.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been fun.

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And where you going next?

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.401 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to continue
to travel and teach?

00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:84%
-Ah, yes.
-Yes.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.056 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-I can't stop right now.

00:57:24.056 --> 00:57:24.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it's too big
of a mission, right?

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's what makes me happy.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.689 align:middle line:84%
It's where my passion is.
-You can tell.

00:57:30.689 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I love to do this.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can tell.

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
to have you here.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
joining me, both of you.

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like to share
my interview with the Ruizes,

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.990 align:middle line:84%
