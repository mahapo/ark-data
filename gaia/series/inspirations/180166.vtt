00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Regina
Meredith began her career

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
in journalism as one
of the first women

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
to enter the field of
sports broadcasting on NBC.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
She's also an Emmy
Award winning producer

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:10%
for her critically acclaimed
environmental documentary

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:10%
called "Sierra in Peril."

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:10%
And you can see Regina as
the host of "Open Minds"

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.542 align:middle line:10%
right here on Gaia.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But what you might
not know about Regina

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
is her flair for
vegetarian cooking.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And she has published
two vegetarian cookbooks.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And she leads
incredible workshops

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
on expanded consciousness.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Thank you.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to that
and I'm thinking, wow,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.945 align:middle line:90%
that's a classic case of ADD.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I know, you've had quite
an incredible career, which

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:10%
is why I'm so
grateful to have you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
on "Inspirations"
because you are a very

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.795 align:middle line:10%
inspirational figure.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Thank you.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.049 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for all of
your listeners or viewers

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.314 align:middle line:84%
that want to see
who's Regina, we're

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
going to learn a
little bit about Regina

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:90%
behind "Open Minds."

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.907 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Sounds good.

00:01:21.907 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've had a great,
great incredible life.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So, wow, one of the first
female broadcasters in sports.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a feat.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: I initially got
into television which started

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:10%
as a ski reporter on a dare.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be in television.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in it.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm painfully shy,
so that was not a career

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:90%
path I would have chosen.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was a situation that
was kind of delicate in that I

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:90%
was a young woman.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I was married.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.933 align:middle line:84%
I was married to a man who
was very competitive and very

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:90%
into sports.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And we would watch the
evening news on Thursdays.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And this was Channel 3 in
Sacramento, the NBC affiliate,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:90%
which is a large market.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And we
would notice how

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
the person giving the ski
conditions on Thursdays

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
were lying.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The weather man would
deliver the news, right?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And he would get
his news directly

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
from the public relations
department and the ski areas.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So we'd be out skiing
that day and digging up

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:90%
our skis on rocks and so forth.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, packed
powder, lovely Squaw Valley,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and on and on, right?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
And we were just laughing.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why
don't you go down and get

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
a job as a ski reporter?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why would I do that?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.004 align:middle line:84%
I have no experience
in television.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, what else are
you going to do with your life?

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was started
kind of berating me

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
like I wasn't ambitious enough.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And I start crying.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said if you
can get an interview,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll go down and talk to them.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Fully expecting it was a
lark and that they would not

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:90%
accept me.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And so he managed
to get an interview

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:90%
with the news director.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he said, probably,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.255 align:middle line:90%
something that wasn't true.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Gave you all the
experience that you didn't

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
have, but it didn't matter.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.496 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: He knew
how to tell a story.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So as I met with
them, it was a time

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
where they were just starting
to look at women potentially

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:90%
for sports.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Jane Chastain, I believe,
was doing local sports

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles at the time.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
She-- I believe she
was the first person.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they thought,
well, if it can be done--

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and they knew I skied and knew a
lot about sports, and so forth.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:90%
So they just did the ski report.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:90%
They hired me on the spot.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I did not know
how to do anything.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to write a script.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when
I was first on,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
the first time it was on
TV, it was, of course, live.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know to look at
the camera with the red light.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They assumed I knew these things
and I didn't know anything.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:90%
So I had a problem.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:90%
My stomach was upset.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I burped during the first show.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:90%
It was just disaster.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think all around,
it probably was a disaster.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But the news director
saw something in me

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and hired me and said, we need
you to come back next week

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and start.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trial by fire.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.745 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, yeah.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Live TV.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.956 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Well I started--

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't admit that
I didn't know anything.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
So I just watched and looked
over people's shoulders

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
as to how you write
a proper script,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's highly
formatted, as you know, in TV.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I just looked
and watched and covertly

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and figured out how to
assemble things on a script.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.291 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of the career.

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea was I would become one
of the first women in sports

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
a few months later,
which did happen.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, only
to 2 and 1/2 years later,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
CBS jumped in the game and put
Phyllis George, a former Miss

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
America on, as
part of their team,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:84%
their sports team on
Sunday Sports Coverage.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So NBC decided to
try to match CBS

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
and they installed me in there.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But that was kind
of a lark also.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Where did you
learn to be so adaptable?

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know I was.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I just always did
what was before me.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
If I had to do it, I would do
it and do it as best I could.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And my early life
had a trauma in it

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:90%
when I was very, very young.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of set me
in a bubble of my own.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
So my world was my making.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really subject to
what other people thought.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a lot
of guidance or--

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
which means I also didn't
have a lot of judgement.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a lot of
other people's stories.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And I think that--

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I think really that's
where it came from.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have other people's
stories overlaying my life.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
whatever I could think of

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:84%
or chose to do or make up
on the moment in the moment,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
I would just do it.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It didn't occur to me
there were obstacles.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you alone
a lot as a child?

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, I was a loner.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I never had more than
one friend at a time.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I would kind of
get close to have

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
one girlfriend where I could of
confide in her and that's it.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And didn't do groups.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Didn't raise my hand in class.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Didn't participate.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.677 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I just sat and watched.

00:06:06.677 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what happened?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind sharing with us?

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.789 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
it was a situation

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that was unintentional,
but it had consequences.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:90%
My parents were very young.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- my
mother had my sister--

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
was ready to have my sister who
was two years younger than I.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have any relatives.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
They'd all-- mom had
moved from Minnesota.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Dad had moved from Texas.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And they were young kids at 19.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Met, got married, had me
at 20 in San Francisco.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And they had no support,
no family support.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.877 align:middle line:84%
So mom had to go to the
hospital to deliver my sister.

00:06:39.877 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was no one
to leave me with,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
because my dad had
to continue working.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So she made an arrangement
that turned out to be unwise--

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't
know at the time--

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.277 align:middle line:84%
to put me in,
essentially, a children's

00:06:54.277 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
receiving center, which
is like an orphanage where

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:90%
you adopt children out from.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Because she knew a lady
in our apartment building

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that had a job there and
could just look in on me

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
from time to time and report
back to my mother if I was OK.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It was only supposed
to be for three days.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.916 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So
they thought, well,

00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that can't do too much
damage in three days, right?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But what happened as
the nursery came down

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
with an ear infection.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
sterile environment.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't-- you couldn't
get your children back out

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
until the entire nursery
settled down with ear infection.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up being
there for weeks.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And there
was this one incident,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
this one day in which they
had had my sister by then.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:90%
She was 10 days late.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.041 align:middle line:84%
And then we were in
another few weeks

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
because of the ear infection.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And they came to this
room that had a glass door

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.769 align:middle line:90%
and waved at me with a new baby.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't
touch me or see me.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have recall
from very early years.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And I was
screaming bloody murder.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:90%
I wanted out.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go home
with them so badly.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know what to do.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
They were 22.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:90%
They had a new baby.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.821 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know about emotional
support and things like that.

00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they turned
around and walked away.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It changed everything.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Then I felt like
I was hysterical.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I calmed
down, I knew I was on my own.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And I always felt that way.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that message
is you're not wanted,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
although unintentional--

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --this is
more important.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I can see how you
could make all this--

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But when you're two
you don't have any discernment.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
But that's when it happens.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We make these
decisions about ourselves

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
at such early ages.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And we-- unconsciously,
they run our lives.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I always have looked at
it as having a hidden benefit,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
because I was not subject to
what other people thought.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a bubble of my
own making and choosing.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
My whole-- really, my
whole life pretty much.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean it could make
relationships challenging

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:84%
at times, because I tend to keep
things to myself because I'm

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:90%
self-sufficient that way.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to learn how
to open up over the years

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and communicate feelings and
not just assume someone else

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:90%
might know these things.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.055 align:middle line:84%
So that's been my
own journey, yeah.

00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why do you call
it a hidden benefit?

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.701 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Because I was
not subject to other people's

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
opinions about me
and my life at all.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:90%
So there was no--

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I had no programming.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The only program I had
was you're on your own.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was on my own.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.389 align:middle line:84%
So no one really looked
over my shoulder.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, I wouldn't--
it wouldn't have mattered to me

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
really, because I just
did what I wanted.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was a pretty
terrible student in school.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.182 align:middle line:84%
If I liked something,
I was always top.

00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't like it, I'd be
sinking toward the bottom

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because I would
put no effort in.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wouldn't care.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.726 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: If I
didn't understand

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the value of a subject,
I just didn't do it.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not
saying that part's

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:90%
a hidden benefit, I just--

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I just did what I wanted.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when it came
time to do this,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I had been embarrassed enough,
be-- you know, feeling like,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.759 align:middle line:90%
well, he thinks I'm a coward.

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So I will show up
for that interview.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get the job anyway.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.671 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified to be on TV.

00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're
incredibly resilient.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to
make a situation work.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered how did you
get into broadcasting here

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.024 align:middle line:90%
at the network at Gaia?

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
it's just-- it's

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:90%
I've been in it my whole life.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:90%
After that dare, I took the job.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, I ended
up on network sports.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very privileged
time in network television.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was bathed in,
you know, dollar bills.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
And everything was first class.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I lived--

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I lived the life of
Reilly during my 20s

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
in particular,
because I had also

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:90%
been discovered as a model.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I did a very tiny stint, just
a few little jobs in modeling

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
when I was 20.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.604 align:middle line:84%
And Chrysler Corporation
discovered me.

00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, fantastic.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So they
hired me as their mascot

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
for one of their divisions.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.076 align:middle line:84%
So I traveled around
the country and was

00:10:54.076 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
paid a retainer every year.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, a lot of
first class treatment

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little baby girl.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Those were the days.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and NBC was--

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
NBC was a real--

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
for me it was kind
of a shot in the arm,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
because I thought if they're
seeing something in me,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
then maybe I have some
talent that I'm not aware of.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So I just took it at
face value, because they

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:90%
thought so that I did.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me the
confidence to do well.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And I did do well.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was totally
presentable on air

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:90%
by this time.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I had been on the
air a few years.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And one thing-- you parley
one thing into another.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, the consciousness.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely-- and you
started it a long time ago--

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting about conscious,
the conscious media network.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:90%
That was way before its time.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It was.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Prior to that in--

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
it would be the late '80s even,
after I'd been a news anchor.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I decided then that mainstream
television wasn't for me.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like the
untruthfulness of it.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I did not like that
we were, essentially,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.459 align:middle line:84%
pouring out enhanced
negative news right

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
before people went
to sleep at night.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing that.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did for a living.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there a
specific breaking point

00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that you had with
that realization?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: There was--
no, the breaking point

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
came politically,
because I was part

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
of a man-woman anchor team.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And they had called me in--

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
the general manager had
called me in and said,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
look, your co-anchor is
not good at small talk,

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:90%
let's just say, at ad libbing.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And he would, he'd mess
things up all the time.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me if I
would please step in and take

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:90%
over all ad libbing.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'd do all the tosses
to weather, sports,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and without making it look
like I'm stepping on him.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.337 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
good little wife--

00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.003 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --doing
what they ask you to do.

00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And so I did it.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And the shows flowed
more smoothly.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.016 align:middle line:90%
Then we went into a recession.

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And they had budget
cuts, because, of course,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.964 align:middle line:84%
advertising revenue
starts dropping.

00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had to cut the
show to a half an hour

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and to one anchor.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And they were very blunt.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.915 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, bad news.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
re-up your contract.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we only can
only have one anchor.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.349 align:middle line:90%
Can't be a woman.

00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:90%
They were very direct about it.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And the
show didn't do too well.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
But that's beside the point.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:90%
That's when I realized this is--

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and I had been through a lot
of politics at NBC as well.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this is
just littered with people

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that will kind of step on--

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
step on your back or your face
to get where they want to go.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And then these false
kinds of values, you know?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Such as--

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: A massive amount
of sexism, massive amount.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I mean,
I noticed early on--

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
this happened early, when
I had only been a sports

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
anchor for about a year.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I did weekend sports.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I did three shows
on the weekend.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I would come and
fill in for the main anchors

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:90%
during the week.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Or I would occasionally,
they'd send me out

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:90%
in the field to do a story.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So the first story I
was assigned to do--

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
which is very near
and dear to me--

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
was with a kind
of a B-rate boxer.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:90%
He looked like he had promise.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, he could
have been a contender.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We had a fight coming up.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- he
was a lightweight.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And I went out.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
They sent me out
with a camera man.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I went out and did the story.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And I came back and
I put beautiful music

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
over it, which wasn't done
in industry at that time,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:90%
not even at the network level.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why can't
you put music over it?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So I put Simon and
Garfunkel's "The Boxer--"

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --over
it at the time.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I did this very
emotional piece about him

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
instead of guys handing the
microphone back and forth,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:84%
what do you think your
odds are tonight, Pete?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.098 align:middle line:84%
And blah, blah, blah,
you know, back and forth.

00:14:48.098 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't relate to
sports that way.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what
motivated people.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I did this really, really
lovely emotional piece

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:90%
with what it meant--

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.004 align:middle line:84%
what he thought the win was
going to bring his life.

00:15:00.004 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And how he thought he was
going to have a big house,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and maybe he didn't have a
girlfriend, and all of that, it

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
was his, you know,
it was his motivation

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
for fighting and having
his face punched in.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
That takes a lot of courage
to show up as a boxer.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I always had this soft
spot for the courage of boxers.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
So I came back.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And we aired the piece on
the main news at night.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reaction, I
thought, that's pretty--

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's pretty
good, you know.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I was happy with.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But instead, the reaction
by the two main anchors

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
was, well, what did
you do that for?

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to put that
much effort in, you know.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
put any effort in.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed this
repeatedly as a news anchor

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and as different
positions throughout, even

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
at the network, I
was putting way more

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.487 align:middle line:90%
work in than the men were.

00:15:50.487 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know it till later.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I started realizing how
come the women work so much

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.744 align:middle line:90%
harder than the men?

00:15:56.744 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And my friends-- I had
a lot of female friends

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that were news
anchors and such--

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.158 align:middle line:90%
they had the same experience.

00:16:01.158 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And then they'd get passed over.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:90%
They were better.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd be acknowledged as
being better at their job,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
openly, I mean even critically
in the newspapers and such.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But they'd be
passed over for men.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's not--
it's not changed.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But yet, you're not out
here with your hashtag #metoo.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
complaining about it.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.147 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I don't feel--

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean that men were
sexist was-- that was

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:90%
the culture of the time.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
That's how it was.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was going
to do a story one time.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And the cameramen that came with
me, a season old guy, you know,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:90%
he kept leering over--

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I had a skirt on--
looking at my legs.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought
what's Bruce doing?

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, finally,
he leaned over.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he put his hand
right here on my thigh.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%
And I hit him.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I said what do you
think you're doing?

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Knock it off.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
You're married.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of that.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he never
did that again.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But I would just handle
things very directly.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.417 align:middle line:90%
And that was the most--

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:90%
that was the closest anyone got.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I did not suffer from
direct sexual harassment.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.809 align:middle line:84%
I was subject to the
sexism in the industry--

00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Difference

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --by way of
different pay and all that.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:90%
But I did not--

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:90%
men did not harass me.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They just knew to stay
away for the most part,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.564 align:middle line:84%
except Bruce, who
was a little dim.

00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:21.519 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had boundaries,
which was great at that time.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
And that was important as well.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.393 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You just don't step
over them for any reason ever.

00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And you deal with it immediately
if anybody else does.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great advice.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Great advice.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you made a decision
that you no longer wanted

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to do this level of hard
news and put people to bed

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:90%
with that level of negativity.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Were you ever an
empath or intuitive?

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.189 align:middle line:84%
I mean the gifts you have now,
where did those come from?

00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I think
they were always there,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't play with them.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I started
playing with them,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
which was probably
by my mid-20s where

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
someone taught me to meditate.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience
the first time I meditated.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.275 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have any
idea what it was for

00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:90%
or what it meant at the time.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I figured it out later.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it like a
Kundalini arising or awakening?

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.793 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: No, it
was a vision I had.

00:18:07.793 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, it was looking
into a past life of mine.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was it?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.105 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It was a woman
who'd hurled herself off

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
of a cliff in a red
sari to her death.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching it in slow
motion and thought what's

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:90%
going on?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So many years later, I put
the pieces together, but--

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was you?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was the
reason, do you know?

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.868 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: No, I've
never really gone into it.

00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I just I came to discover
what it was and why.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's not--

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I've looked into a
lot of past lives.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.896 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't curious enough about
that one to even look at.

00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
something tragic

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
happened, because red
is a wedding sari.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So it could have been
an invading force, which

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:90%
happened where the women--

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the wives of the
king, for example--

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
royal, if you were
in a royal family.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the wives, they
would put their red saris on.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I have a friend who's Indian.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And she explained all of this
socially to me and historically

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and said you would
put-- don a red sari

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and then take your own life.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.001 align:middle line:90%
And that was one way to do it.

00:19:05.001 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
There were many ways to do it.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, though.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.015 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Something
happened that was

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
a downward turn
in my circumstance

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that I felt that I needed to
kill myself over obviously.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I
haven't really looked into it.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
boxer and you ask them

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
why do they sacrifice
themselves to change their life,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:90%
essentially that's what you did.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So it
was just one thing.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I've seen many, many
past lives since then.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And I also--

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a little hypnotherapy
clinic for a while,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
so I've taken a lot of other
people into their past lives

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As a hypnotherapist?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.052 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a--
like I said ADD--

00:19:43.052 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I like to do a lot of things.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Anything that
interests me, I just do.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:90%
You can't just blow by that one.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.667 align:middle line:90%
You had a hypnotherapy clinic?

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
You were a hypnotherapist?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Um-mm

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.872 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For how long?

00:19:54.872 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Just
a couple of years.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Then I went back into TV.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
quite a diversion.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
You just do that, baby.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you took
people into deep hypnosis.

00:20:06.595 --> 00:20:07.697 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Um-hmm.

00:20:07.697 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what did you-- did
you find you liked it, or--

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I found I was
particularly good at past life

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I did not like working
with addictions,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
pain, emotional pain,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:90%
around them for people.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't enjoy--
and it's stubborn.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
When I was certified
in hypnotherapy,

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I had a very wise teacher.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And his father had also
been a psychologist

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and hypnotherapist.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:37.784 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- which was very
interesting for me to learn--

00:20:37.784 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that almost all addictions
have other entities

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
attached to it,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
which is not what a
psychologist would normally say.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.359 align:middle line:84%
But he said when you have gone
into some kind of dysfunction

00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and you have damaged your
field-- through alcohol

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
or drugs in particular, but
even through anything that's

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
kind of OCD, even smoking,
you start kind of damaging,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
you can say that the
integrity of your auric field.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
That allows for entities to come
closer and closer in and take

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
advantage of you.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if Uncle Bob liked
smoking, and he's passed on,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:90%
and you were close.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
He can-- he can come in--
this is a very dense,

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
silly example--

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
but he can come in and enjoy the
pleasure and sensation hanging

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:84%
out with you while you're
smoking and encourage it.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you had to
deal with that.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
You had to go back to the very
first time these events started

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the
psychological soup was

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
at that time that made you
pick up the first cigarette.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Was it to impress others?

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:90%
To feel cool?

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Was it because you
wanted to defy someone?

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was so
much you had to go into

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:90%
to start unwinding it.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't enjoy it
as much as people who

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
came in for regression work.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
That was I loved it and
I had a skill for it.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you realized
and worked with other realms

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.432 align:middle line:84%
and recognized that we've been
here before, several times.

00:21:54.432 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Well, yeah.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had many of my own
experiences by then anyway.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was totally
comfortable with it.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so thus
getting into hidden truths

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.715 align:middle line:84%
and different types of
expansive consciousness.

00:22:06.715 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, first
I did environmental--

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes, yes.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.811 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I an
environmental report

00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to get environmental
understanding

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
into the household
on the nightly news.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I did a documentary
called "Sierra in Peril"

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that did very well
throughout the PBS system.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It won awards.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think it may still
be used in the curriculum.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It was at UC Berkeley, I
remember, all the way down

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to middle school as to
how an ecosystem works

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and that competing
interests can come together

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
to start a healing process
for an environmental system.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
So it was good.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.585 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of love and
energy and research into that.

00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what are some
of your favorite topics?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It's
dependent on life.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It depends on where
you're putting yourself

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:90%
in life in that moment.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I love a lot of things.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And in terms-- you're talking
about just metaphysics

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
specifically?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the shows, what
are some of your favorite show

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:90%
topics?

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
That you want to get
out into the world.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: I know.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.501 align:middle line:84%
It's such a hard question,
because I'm thinking--

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like a screen with 1,000
pixels like, oh, my god, who--

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
look at kind of what's

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world
behind the scenes

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
power structures,

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.215 align:middle line:84%
I love interviewing
Danny Sheehan.

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:10%
You know, I don't
really interview him.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.105 align:middle line:10%
I can't prepare for him.

00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's a lot.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: His
knowledge is too vast.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.739 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: I'm just--
anything I would do

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:10%
would be totally insufficient.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I basically wind Danny up, ask
him a question, and he goes.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just I love
what comes out of it,

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:84%
because he has such depth
of knowledge and experience.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:90%
He's so interesting.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I
always love those.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes I do
channellers and psychics.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And I love Belinda.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:10%
She probably has the sweetest
energy of all and very pure,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:10%
very, very.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:10%
I like it when it lines up
with a pure heart and no ego.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:10%
And so the ones I do along
that line are really lovely.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.589 align:middle line:84%
I've done-- sometimes
it's hardcore.

00:23:59.589 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:10%
I did an interview
in London recently

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:10%
with David Icke that was really
a wonderful rendering of David.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:10%
Kind of moving along
on his own path.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:10%
I love the subject of
how the soul works.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:90%
That's my passion.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I do in my
workshops when I'm teaching.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's really about the dialogue
and going into companionship

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
with the higher mind and soul
from this earthly perspective

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and making it work on Earth.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Because too many
people turn to fields

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysics with the
idea of enlightenment

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:84%
as a goal, which is to me really
not a good way to go about it.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's through
pain of some kind.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times when
people are in pain or have

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
experienced trauma-- which
is every human being--

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
you're susceptible to
messages that really aren't

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:90%
that high quality or healthy.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And you take that in and
then you substitute it

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
for your own intuition
and your own knowledge.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
really kind of get off

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the wagon with the metaphysical
movement in general.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Anything that substitutes
their word and their wisdom

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
for your innate word and
innate wisdom, to me,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.977 align:middle line:90%
is doing humanity a disservice.

00:25:17.977 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So gurus, people
that are self-proclaimed.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Not down with it.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Not down with that
at all, because they

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
almost always give you
their method, their thing,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
their path, their belief.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is we
all have great wisdom.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So my thing is to help people
really integrate and tap

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
into that in a real way
that works on Earth.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about this,
well, my guides told me,

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:90%
my guides say?

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:90%
How do you interview that?

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, that's
challenging because we all

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:90%
have guides.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And those who are open, and if
you have your ego set aside,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're not dependent
on the nature of the answer

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
for your ego satisfaction
or survival--

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
if you can go with
what I'm saying

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is if you can go
with non-attachment

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and let the information
flow through,

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:84%
you can get great information
that works for you.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you have an
attachment to the outcome, now

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:90%
it's compromised.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
hear is actually

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:90%
through that filter of need--

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
neediness, desire.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Then you can't trust it so much.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
great distinction.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You can really tell
when someone speaking

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
from a true authentic place of
guidance as opposed to wanting

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.275 align:middle line:84%
someone to like them
because of their guidance.

00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:32.075 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, yeah.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is a certain ego
that comes with a spiritualist.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a fine line.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
This industry, this topic
that we're talking about,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
it can be very egocentric
where someone makes up an idea

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and people that are
hungry for information

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:90%
instantly will follow that.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: As soon as you
say I'm the path, I'm the way,

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.662 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the know, I'm on the
inside, I stop listening.

00:26:59.662 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't listen to anyone that
makes those claims, because I

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:90%
know that that's ego speaking.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And that means they probably
are not any of those things.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.111 align:middle line:84%
I've had the privilege,
through the last 30

00:27:08.111 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
years of being in
this field, of knowing

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:90%
people who are the real deal.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't know their names.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:90%
You almost never know.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:90%
People that know, know.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you haven't dug down
in yourself to get beyond

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
the quote "self-proclaimed"
teachers and gurus,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
you probably won't ever
run into the real deals.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:90%
They're usually quiet.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't make any claims.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:90%
They'll put you first.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They'll put your journey, your
own integrity, your own soul

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
journey first above
any message they have.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's all an attempt to help
you become your true best self

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and listen to your own voice.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.388 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And that's
what I respect and honor

00:27:48.388 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is those kind of
people that do have

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
genuine teachings, though
they won't call themselves

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
a teacher per se.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To listen
to your own truth.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there's also
the concept of the aliens

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.581 align:middle line:84%
and people who have
been abductees, these--

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, I host "Coast
to Coast" as well.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I hear these stories
repetitively that

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:90%
seem so real to these people.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're also similar.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I think some
of them are very real.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I think some aren't
and some are.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
you have to learn

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:90%
how to listen with discernment.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand that
sometimes the experience is

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.569 align:middle line:90%
real to that person.

00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not making it up,

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.411 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Something happened.

00:28:29.411 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I had
such great admiration

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:90%
for the work of Dr. John Mack.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
John Mack was the
one who really put--

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
he put a cloak of
respectability around it

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
by simply choosing, as the
Head of Clinical Psychology

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard, to take this
body of work on, analyze it.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
real is happening.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And part of the proof
something real is happening--

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
proof's in the pudding, right--

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:01.485 align:middle line:84%
is that after these
experiences, most commonly--

00:29:01.485 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and when they're
real experiences,

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
these people have an
enhanced sense of awareness.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Their psychic abilities leap up.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They have openings they didn't
have prior to the event.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So you know that
something has happened.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now whether it happened
in another dimension

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
on another plane while
they were asleep,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
whether it happened where
they are sure they remember

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
their body floating out
of their bedroom window,

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I think all of those
things are possible.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And they have happened to
various people throughout time.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The problem is if
you're using it

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to make an excuse
for something else

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
or because you're
titillated or intrigued

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:84%
or want to position yourself
somehow in the world,

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
then, you know, I'm a
little more suspect.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to use your own
personal discernment to see,

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:84%
ah, they seem like
the real deal to me.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:90%
They feel like the real deal.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
out they weren't.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.946 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
out why is it that I

00:29:57.946 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
thought that was the real
deal when they turned out

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:90%
to be a fraud?

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.604 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how we
learn how to use--

00:30:03.604 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that's how we learn
how to develop

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:90%
our sense of discernment.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to make
mistakes and evaluate it.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we know
Regina the host,

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know
Regina the teacher.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell me--

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.449 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I don't
like the word teacher.

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I like to guide people.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said I don't
like to call myself a teacher.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I do workshops.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And I guide people
through processes

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that allow them to go
deeper into themselves

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and deeper into the--

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I call it-- the little spark
of desire of the spirit,

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
of the soul, the soul's voice.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm also on a path
called the hermetic path,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:90%
I have been for many years.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes I
use their terminology

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:90%
just because it's convenient.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I really like it
because it dovetails

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of other
things that I know

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.258 align:middle line:90%
and have experienced in life.

00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So that path serves
academically for me.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what that is.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: OK.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a body of
esoteric knowledge.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much still kept
fairly quiet for a reason.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And you certainly
don't want that kind

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
of information bandied
about in a cheap way

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
like we do now,
and tweeted about.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And especially when you
get further in years in,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:90%
it's very powerful.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that misused.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't want that misused.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And so they just keep it quiet.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:90%
You study.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very solitary.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And you practice.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's a path.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's one that
I've chosen because I

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%
call it a proper
education, because it

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:84%
goes into all aspects
of the unseen world,

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
everything from art
and poetry and music

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
into science and quantum physics
and other realms of entities

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of
encompasses all of it.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But I only bring it up because
they use a certain language

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:90%
that is convenient.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
looking at the mind,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
they have it broken into
higher mind and lower mind.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:10%
And simply, if anyone has seen--

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:10%
on my site, you
can see it under--

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:10%
you'll see a little picture
on my site reginameredith.com

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:10%
that says Starworks, USA.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically is about
the origins of humankind.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:10%
It's a story that
I render that I

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:10%
was taught by these beings
many, many years ago

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:10%
and just watch for
evidence through the years

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:10%
to see if it holds water.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And finally, after 30 years I
started sharing it publicly.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.569 align:middle line:84%
And I'm invited in as a speaker
at conferences and such.

00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that listens to
that will understand

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.540 align:middle line:84%
what I mean when I say
the lower mind is simply

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:84%
the earthly animal
expression that we have that

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.450 align:middle line:84%
gets us through life
on a daily basis.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is the part
that is connected with the soul.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more refined, other
dimensional aspect of ourselves

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that is connected to the all.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
your own development,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
pretty much can access
knowledge of all kinds.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:90%
So we have access to it.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know how to reach
into that part very well.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
I help people do.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I help facilitate
exercises where

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
they can hear their
true voice and what

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
it's saying, what it's
desiring, and then

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
start connecting with
it on a conscious level

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to start going into,
literally, a relationship

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
between the earthly part that
gets us through the day, keeps

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
us from bumping into things,
and crashing our cars,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and deciding we need
to go the grocery store

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and what to get on the list,
and the part that should be much

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:90%
more influential in our lives.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That is the part that
understands from the time we're

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:90%
born, essentially, our Dharma.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Which relationships do we
have to balance and correct

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:84%
in this opportunity,
in this incarnation?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's called Starworks, USA.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:90%
You'll see it.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of the
banners on my site.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It says Starworks, USA.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Click here.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:10%
Origins of the human species.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:10%
So anybody can watch it.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:10%
It's all free.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.403 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:33:47.403 --> 00:33:50.800 align:middle line:10%
And so what did you learn
about time around this?

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Well, you
know if you take it

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:10%
into a more modern,
practical-- first of all,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:10%
everything took way more
time than science is even

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:10%
beginning to understand.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
These things take
vast periods of time.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And they've gotten
pretty good at certain

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
dating to peg certain
events and certain places.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's happening
around the last flood,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:84%
for example, is
really interesting,

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're finding
a lot of evidence--

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
you know the Gobekli
Tepe story and so forth.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the
development of something,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.745 align:middle line:84%
that takes massive
amount of time

00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and a massive
amount of patience.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
talking about it

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.321 align:middle line:84%
more in the common sense
of how we use time?

00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A little
bit of both though.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Because time-- as you're
speaking with these beings

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of time
you're speaking about,

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
it all can really truly
collapse, can't it?

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.089 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's timeless.

00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.889 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is
one of the things

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't shared with
you, my near-death experience.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the things that I

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
saw was this timelessness
and this expanded

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.401 align:middle line:90%
oneness of everything.

00:34:56.401 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right, absolutely.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.816 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that sense of
what you're talking about.

00:34:59.816 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It was-- when you're looking
at life on that scale.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at
intelligence on that scale--

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --the one thing it
has in its favor is patience.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.204 align:middle line:90%
Patience take strength--

00:35:15.204 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it does.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --to
allow everything

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:90%
to form in its own time.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is right
down to every time--

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
a watched pot never boils.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:84%
This comes down to making
a soup and so forth.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Which kind of gets us into you
were talking about the things I

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:84%
share with people
in these workshops

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and the experiences they have.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a big one, the
notion that now we're here--

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, right?

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: We're part animal.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We're part splendidly
intelligent, creative, divine

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.450 align:middle line:90%
aspect of ourselves.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:90%
It's there all the time.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.180 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:90%
It's in our cells.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And we just don't access it.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
We tend not to access it,
because Earth life blows it

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And now with social media
and all the distractions

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
we're not paying any
attention to the voice that's

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:90%
constantly whispering to them.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't even hear it.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It's drowned out by the mundane.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So I help people open up and
listen to that voice again.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
So they can--

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By slowing down?

00:36:05.845 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
By being quiet?

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I
do a lot of exercises.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, even I even do
past life regressions with them

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
in groups and take them into
very specific meditations

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
of recovery of this skill,
this talent, these memories,

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But time is-- that's
the interesting thing.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Because on Earth, people
get so frustrated and angry

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and defeated.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And it almost always
is tied to time.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, if
you're a being that

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:84%
can manifest at the
speed of thought

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're now in this body in
this dimension in this material

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
world trying to manifest
something, it can take forever.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It can not happen at all.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So people become--
they live in despair.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
When am I going to
have the love I want?

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.550 align:middle line:90%
When am I going to have a baby?

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.794 align:middle line:84%
When am I going to be able to
manifest the career I want?

00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got to have a
buy in from a whole bunch

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%
of other people--

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
or at least one other person
in the case of a baby--

00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.418 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --and
the entity that's

00:37:01.418 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be born, two other
entities, just to have a baby.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.539 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: The timing has
to be right for the one who

00:37:07.539 --> 00:37:11.050 align:middle line:84%
wants to come through, for
the father, for the bodies,

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So time becomes almost
we don't recognize

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.260 align:middle line:90%
that the problem is just time.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.822 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you have
a sense of grace,

00:37:19.822 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening to the
spirit and they're saying

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.800 align:middle line:90%
you haven't met that one yet.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.540 align:middle line:90%
That's not here yet.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy what you're doing.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Learn from this
current experience.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't the one that
you'll have your child with.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:84%
If you can hear
yourself, you don't

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
get so wound up and
defeated and frustrated

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and feel so hopeless over life.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's such an
interesting concept, time,

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.620 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it
feels like it blows by.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it feels
like it is going so slowly.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.985 align:middle line:84%
So it begs the question
of what is time?

00:37:50.985 --> 00:37:51.785 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:51.785 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
it's a construct here

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.019 align:middle line:90%
that we're tied to.

00:37:54.019 --> 00:37:55.935 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've got
clocks running, every kind

00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of clock running all the time.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.245 align:middle line:84%
So in this dimension, we're tied
to our notion of linear time.

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But in
other dimensions--

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: You're not.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --or other
forms you're not.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: No.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why guides--
go back to guides.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.575 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: A guide can tell
you this is going to happen.

00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You're like, oh,
yippee, I'm so excited.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:90%
My true love is on his way.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
five years later.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we didn't say when,

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:90%
because they don't work in time.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But we can.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I would say that you
have this incredible use

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of this construct
of time to create

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and creativity, and your
knowledge of the universe,

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and your knowledge of
this wonderful star

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.830 align:middle line:84%
system and guides, that
you intentionally manifest

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.917 align:middle line:90%
your next steps, Regina.

00:38:37.917 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I do, but
I just do it through desire.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.051 align:middle line:90%
It's what I want.

00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:42.258 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a great example.

00:38:42.258 --> 00:38:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And so I don't
do it because someone

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:90%
is telling me to do it.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I know-- well, it's my Dharma.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have known
that for a long time.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.291 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And I did
not want to be on TV.

00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to
be a news anchor.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
any of those things.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I just did it because
I was dared into it

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and they kept offering me
jobs and I needed the money.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:84%
On a soul level, it was
training, training, training.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
I just kept my nose in it.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Keep training,
because the time will

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.700 align:middle line:84%
come when you have the freedom
to express it the way you wish.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That-- that's when
that all comes together.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And your hard work
and your diligence

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and your research
and your curiosity,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.010 align:middle line:84%
combined with your
knowledge of all

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:90%
of these great creativities--

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're interested in the
hidden truths and the esoteric

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:90%
and what's beyond beyond.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is the
soup of who you are.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fascinating.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.648 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I mean I'm
curious about a lot of things.

00:39:34.648 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's still a lot to do,
because I see people becoming--

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
what really pains me is to see
people becoming so increasingly

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.790 align:middle line:84%
distracted where I know
they're not listening anymore.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
People are just brain
dead walking out

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:90%
in front of cars on the road.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's scary in California.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't drive like I used to
because I don't know who's

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
going to pull some really
stupid move at the next second,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:90%
because it happens everyday.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've watched some
horrendous crashes lately,

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.330 align:middle line:90%
just horrendous car wrecks.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And I witnessed a motorcyclist
right where that wall is.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't know what he was thinking.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Jamming up between the
cars, which is legal,

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:90%
going way too fast.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:90%
He didn't apply the brake.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.500 align:middle line:84%
He just slammed into
the back of a car.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:90%
His motorcycle shattered.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.630 align:middle line:90%
He went flying through the air.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought why
didn't he brake?

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:90%
What was he thinking?

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing this
stuff all the time now.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
People are not occupying
their bodies anymore.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They're living on
total distraction.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know that
these devices are largely

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
contributing factors.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't on a cell phone.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.091 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: He just
wasn't dialed in.

00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:48.529 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happened
in his perceptive field.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
a great point, though,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.625 align:middle line:84%
about distractibility,
not just with the device,

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:84%
because everything
we have access

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:90%
to with the palm of our hand.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's these other I would
say energies, dimensions,

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
them are getting louder.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: That, too.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
We have this time
now where humanity

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and the other dimensions
are closer to one another.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of people
in the metaphysical field

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:84%
don't bring up or
don't understand

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.500 align:middle line:90%
is it goes both ways.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:84%
You have higher
frequency beings that

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
are more readily
available, that are there

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to guide you and protect you
and work with you until you can

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:84%
remember and do
it yourself, which

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.249 align:middle line:84%
could take us a very long time
to get back to that place.

00:41:36.249 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:90%
But they're there for us.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And everybody has them.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:84%
They're benevolent beings
who have given-- they're

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:90%
giving their service to us.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And we can tap in at any time.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And we know the
wonderful stories

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of kind of angelic experiences
that happen at car crash sites

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:84%
where someone seems to have
just been gently lifted

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're 20 feet
from their car, safe,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.890 align:middle line:90%
without a broken bone.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:90%
They do that.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you're looking

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.740 align:middle line:84%
at the Earth is sandwiched
between higher realms and lower

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.430 align:middle line:84%
realms, the lower realm beings
are much more in touch, too.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you have taken
your frequencies

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:12.840 align:middle line:84%
down to points of resentment,
anger, hatred, lack

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.302 align:middle line:84%
of compassion, and
so forth, you're

00:42:16.302 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:84%
a great companion
for these beings.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.930 align:middle line:90%
They can come right in.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're being
infected kind of the wrong way,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.820 align:middle line:90%
the downward way.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to take
time and a lot of will

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to pull yourself
back up out of that.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we have
this polarized world--

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.271 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --right now
that is very much

00:42:34.271 --> 00:42:38.340 align:middle line:84%
a battle between those lower
frequencies, the competition,

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.067 align:middle line:84%
the lies, and those higher
frequencies, those that see

00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:42.900 align:middle line:90%
hope for the future.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I feel as humanity,
we are sandwiched right

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.917 align:middle line:84%
where we could make
it either decision.

00:42:47.917 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You can
choose your world.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has the right.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stay in anger
and resentment about things you

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.810 align:middle line:84%
literally cannot
control, then stay angry.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:57.999 align:middle line:90%
Stay resentful.

00:42:57.999 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what
you'll get more of.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's what
you're going to get more of.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.247 align:middle line:90%
But that's a choice.

00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:90%
That's an absolute choice.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Now it feels like I can't
believe that tweet that

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:90%
came out this morning.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And you could just be beside
yourself with frustration

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, upset
and everything.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.520 align:middle line:90%
But you can't stay there.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to let
it go and get back

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:84%
into what you can produce
with your own time on Earth

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:90%
with your own energy.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: There's so many
questions that I have for you.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want to learn more
about whisperings of the soul.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Could you share that
with us a little bit?

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: The soul
and the soul higher

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:84%
mind complex, they
work together.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it
through hermetic terms,

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
the soul would be the
positive and the higher mind

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.037 align:middle line:90%
would be the negative.

00:43:44.037 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't mean bad.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It means positive and
negative are paired together

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:90%
of the soul complex.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is the part
that is talking to you.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
The soul is what
incarnates along

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.700 align:middle line:84%
with the higher mind, along
with the subconscious.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:84%
All the information from
before comes with you.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It's hidden in there in the
subconscious, subconscious.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a sudden
fear of, for example, heights,

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:13.560 align:middle line:84%
you've probably brought that
through from another time

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.940 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't had any
negative experience.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.973 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So that's the kind
of subconscious doing its thing

00:44:17.973 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:90%
to protect you.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is in connection
with the soul directly.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, no,
this person, you

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
need to be patient with this
person in your life now,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.300 align:middle line:84%
because maybe this is a person
that you harmed in another time

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.430 align:middle line:90%
or dismissed or something.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving really
baby examples of it.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul's whispering
through the higher mind, which

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.420 align:middle line:84%
is whispering down to
your everyday mind,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:90%
your conscious mind.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:84%
No, you get this
little feeling, it's

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
going to be such a bitch
with this person right now.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.760 align:middle line:90%
And I feel so bad about it.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:90%
I should be more patient.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.900 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
higher mind interpreting

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.510 align:middle line:84%
a whispering coming
through, that this needs

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.860 align:middle line:90%
to be balanced and adjusted.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:90%
So pay attention.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.898 align:middle line:84%

up something in yourself

00:44:59.898 --> 00:45:01.350 align:middle line:90%
that can do this better.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the higher
mind speaking to you.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.720 align:middle line:84%

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.210 align:middle line:84%

The only thing is,
it is perishable.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:49.710 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:50.480 align:middle line:10%
- What would you say maximum?

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:10%
- About four days.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:52.860 align:middle line:10%
I would say four to five days.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.660 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:10%
- And keep it well
chilled, always.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.110 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Well chilled because
this does rely

And today, we're
focusing on desserts.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:10%

It has an exotic allure.

And we're going to make
scones flavored with chai.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:10%
- What did you want the oven at?

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:10%
- 375.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:00.810 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.610 align:middle line:10%
Almost done then.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:02.445 align:middle line:10%
- Great.

00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And this is just about together,
bringing all those loose ends.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:10%
And then what we'll do is just
to give the top a nice shine

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.610 align:middle line:10%
and deep brown,
we're going to brush

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.316 align:middle line:10%
with a mixture of egg yolk
and a little bit of cream.

00:47:17.316 --> 00:47:19.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to sprinkle the
top with the scones dough

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.472 align:middle line:10%
with some of this nice
demerara sugar, which

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:23.846 align:middle line:10%
is a coarse brown
sugar, and then

00:47:23.846 --> 00:47:25.560 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of
cinnamon sugar on top.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:10%
And then it's going to
be segmented into however

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:10%
many portions we want.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.560 align:middle line:10%
- These will be wonderful.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:10%

right into the oven.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:10%
- Very good.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.300 align:middle line:10%
- Are we ready to go?

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.100 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.460 align:middle line:10%
And what about 12 minutes?

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.260 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.600 align:middle line:10%
About 15 to 20 minutes, perhaps.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:10%
I like them real
crisp and brown.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.120 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.840 align:middle line:10%
Sounds good.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And we'll clean this mess up.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:10%
And then we're on to
recipe number two.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.240 align:middle line:10%
To what's coming up?

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:10%
A lemon--

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.750 align:middle line:10%
- A lemon tart,
tea and lemon tart.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:50.880 align:middle line:10%
I call it awesome, awesome.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:10%
- And I already stuck my finger
in the lemon curd back there.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.670 align:middle line:10%
It is awesome.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.980 align:middle line:10%

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.780 align:middle line:10%

- Thank you.

00:47:56.997 --> 00:47:59.580 align:middle line:10%
- Well, Robert, I want to thank
you once again for joining us.

It's always a pleasure for me.

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And a producer said, let's
take this thing to national TV.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure, why not?

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the director of
daytime programming,

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.320 align:middle line:84%
who had Julia Childs and "This
Old House" on, came, flew out,

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.120 align:middle line:90%
met with me.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.820 align:middle line:90%
I made him some food.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's
do this thing.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started "Regina's
Vegetarian Table"

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was already a hands
on producer top to bottom.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.800 align:middle line:90%
And I love production.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I put a lot of
production values in my shows

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.160 align:middle line:84%
prior to that, but also in
this one where I went out

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.860 align:middle line:84%
in the field, had health
experts, a wine expert

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.040 align:middle line:84%
at the end of each show,
farmers on organic produce.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Had original music done
for all the segments.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time music
was used in a cooking show.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So it had a
different feel to it.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was for me just a
playground to have fun.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it does
feel like you are

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:90%
very intentional in your work.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Even though it looks like fun,
you are deeply researched.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.511 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot that's going
on behind what we see.

00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Kind
of and kind of not.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't trained as a chef.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I just like to cook.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.923 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I said I'm
just do I'm doing this show

00:49:32.923 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and sharing my recipes with you.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.037 align:middle line:90%
And it just took off.

00:49:36.037 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, but
you pulled this out.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.645 align:middle line:90%
And you really did make it work.

00:49:39.645 --> 00:49:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Where do you live now?

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.484 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned you
lived on a farm?

00:49:42.484 --> 00:49:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, I just
moved from Sedona, Arizona,

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.730 align:middle line:84%
which was my beloved place,
my beloved community and home.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.000 align:middle line:90%
And the time's up for it.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So I move back to
California to the home

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.140 align:middle line:90%
my father built in the country.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So we live in the
Sierra Foothills.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lovely Satsuma
Mandarin orange orchard that

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:90%
is a small commercial orchard.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's an area
that's no growth.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So the next city
over sells their land

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:90%
to the highest bidder.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but shopping malls,
big box stores, and you

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.220 align:middle line:84%
drive across the railroad
tracks into our town and nothing

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.680 align:middle line:84%
but potholes and minimum
of five acre lots.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very country.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.059 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's no
growth limit on it?

00:50:20.059 --> 00:50:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Oh,
yeah, the people that

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.947 align:middle line:84%
live there don't want any
intrusion in the two towns.

00:50:23.947 --> 00:50:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I live right on the
border of the two.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And the total population is
8,000 between both towns.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And they won't allow
growth to happen,

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.300 align:middle line:90%
which I'm very thankful for.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:90%
No developments.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's just farms.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And so people are coming
in from LA and the Bay Area

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and snapping up the land and
building their McMansions

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of vineyards
have gone in recently.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It's considered the new
wine growing region.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The DuPonts bought the
property two doors down

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and put a vineyard in
and a wine tasting room.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But they still have to comply
to the local standards.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It's privately owned.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're living
by the standards.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.547 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of you're
feeling now the kind of--

00:51:02.547 --> 00:51:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Progression.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: --progression.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It happens.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It happens, yeah.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.238 align:middle line:84%
You know, people just
want to enjoy the country

00:51:08.238 --> 00:51:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and get away from being crowded.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Including me.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're also
able to get out.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You are still very
busy and you work.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you can come back
to a place that is home.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And you have--
I've heard you talk

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:23.240 align:middle line:84%
about beauty as being a very
important aspect of your life.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you share that
with us a little bit?

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It always has
been, since I remember,

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.380 align:middle line:84%
since I was two or
three years old.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I just understood
something about

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.790 align:middle line:84%
flowers and beautiful colors
and symmetry and so forth.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I started studying
it and just kind of looking

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:90%
into it more as time went on.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And recently,
interviewed a man whom

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:48.606 align:middle line:84%
I adore, Stephen Ross, on the
subject of beauty on my site.

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And we went in it together.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And we've tracked each
other in our lives,

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the work we've
done for the last 30 years,

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and Stephen--

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and the point of
the conversation

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.680 align:middle line:84%
is that beauty adds refinement
to anything you apply it to.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And beauty can be something as
simple as a smile to a clerk

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.330 align:middle line:90%
who's having a rough day--

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.910 align:middle line:90%
that's an act of beauty--

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:15.106 align:middle line:84%
to literally creating something,
creating something beautiful,

00:52:15.106 --> 00:52:16.730 align:middle line:84%
like what you do on
your show, creating

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful environment,
and inviting people

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.790 align:middle line:84%
in in a beautiful
way to talk with you.

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.460 align:middle line:90%
That's an act of beauty.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:84%
You can paint your house
a lovely, soft turquoise

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.190 align:middle line:90%
that soothes the eyes.

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But every time you commit
yourself to an act of beauty,

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you're raising the
frequency of your field.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It goes up, up, up, up,
every act of beauty.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.034 align:middle line:90%
And that starts with thoughts.

00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
negative thoughts.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:44.870 align:middle line:90%
We all get mad.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But, yet, if you can recover
yourself and return it

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.350 align:middle line:90%
to something beautiful.

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.450 align:middle line:84%
For me, a lot of times
it's just deciding I

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.460 align:middle line:84%
want to bake something
for my friends.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Baking for me is like a therapy.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.420 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very soothing.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I love sharing
it with other people.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So I just get in the
kitchen and pull out

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.190 align:middle line:84%
my apron and my stuff,
my gluten free stuff.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your gluten free stuff.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I love what you
say about beauty.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Beauty makes things
calm and quiet for me.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.476 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's not--

00:53:12.476 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
facial beauty and clothes.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about just
calm, serene, beauty.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.630 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of a flower
and how it blooms.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.937 align:middle line:84%
And a strawberry and
the lines of the seeds.

00:53:23.937 --> 00:53:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: This was very
important in ancient cultures,

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.710 align:middle line:84%
ancient Persian,
Chinese, Japanese.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:34.661 align:middle line:84%
Beauty was the ultimate to
aspire to on all levels.

00:53:34.661 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Even though there were other
factors of those societies that

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.685 align:middle line:84%
could be quite
cruel in the day, it

00:53:40.685 --> 00:53:43.490 align:middle line:84%
was still an aspiration to
live in a more beautiful way.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:45.498 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It's not anymore.

00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:46.610 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's so
wonderful about beauty to me

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is that we were
talking about time

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and how we get
frustrated because we

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.470 align:middle line:84%
can't manifest the
big stuff that takes

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:56.270 align:middle line:90%
a buy in from other people.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.150 align:middle line:84%
With little acts of beauty
like baking something, doing

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:02.810 align:middle line:84%
a little painting, just going
over and helping someone,

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.670 align:middle line:84%
those things you
can do in real time

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and have real, on Earth
time satisfaction,

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.560 align:middle line:90%
like now, instant gratification.

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Those acts of beauty
make it possible to be

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.880 align:middle line:84%
patient through the rest
of the really big stuff

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.880 align:middle line:84%
while raising your
frequencies at the same time.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really big on just engage
in any little act of beauty

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you can any time
it presents itself,

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.840 align:middle line:84%
because that is instant
gratification in this realm.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so important.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:84%
That is very necessary
with all the things

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.900 align:middle line:90%
we have going on in our world.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to ask my guests,
what is your biggest

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.925 align:middle line:90%
why for why you do what you do?

00:54:35.925 --> 00:54:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Pretty
much because of what

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.560 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about
just a little bit ago.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I see that people
are struggling.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
they're struggling

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is because they're not
listening to themselves.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you can help
somebody learn to dial back

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:84%
into themselves and their
incredible true nature,

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.460 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
these questions.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.386 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
despair that we're

00:54:57.386 --> 00:54:59.510 align:middle line:84%
seeing on the planet, the
distraction we're seeing,

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:00.560 align:middle line:90%
there's no need for it.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.790 align:middle line:90%
You're dialed in.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:10%
So what I do is
simply to give people

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.170 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different
perspectives-- all of them,

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:10%
all of the paths lead to Rome.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.167 align:middle line:84%
Start dialing back
into your true self.

00:55:10.167 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I love that you shared so
many things with us about how

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.916 align:middle line:90%
to live an inspired life.

00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:17.540 align:middle line:84%
That really is truly
what you're doing.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's the
way I do it, anyway.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you so much for
showing us an example of how

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:90%
to live an inspired life.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You're amazing.

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Thank you so much.

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me on.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.733 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:55:27.733 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You're very gracious.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.882 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's been
fun, host to host.

00:55:30.882 --> 00:55:31.697 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Indeed.

00:55:31.697 --> 00:55:34.280 align:middle line:10%
