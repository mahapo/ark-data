00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:10%
So whatever statistics you
read, unfortunately, divorce

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
is becoming more common
than long-lasting marriages.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So what is the breakdown
between men and women?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Joining us again is
Alison Armstrong,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
back to answer more questions
about relationships.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Alison has spent the last 20
years educating men and women

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
on how to communicate better
and to master the relationships

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:90%
between one another.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to the show.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ALISON ARMSTRONG: Thanks.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.393 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, we're
glad to have you.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.345 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: There's so much
more to be said about this.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, you can talk
for hours and hours on this.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You have over the
20 years that you've

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
been doing workshops for people
and relationship workshops--

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
most of them for free, which has
been an enormous contribution

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to our society.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
stages of development

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that you have broken
down with men.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with men.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: OK.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:10%
And we have found that these
stages will apply to a women

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:10%
if she is engaged in a career.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:10%
So that masculine pursuit will
pull out the masculine in her.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:10%
And we discovered this
because we noticed

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:10%
that we got imprinted as women.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:10%
We get imprinted
with a kind of man.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:10%
And then, what
works on him, when

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:10%
we try to apply it to a man 10
or 20 years older than that,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't work at all.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And my girlfriend and I
were trying to distinguish--

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:10%
do you know?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So some of them seem like boys,
and you have to treat them

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
like boys.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:10%
And some of them are
like guys, you know?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:10%
And then, there's the men.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:10%
They're the ones like, whoa,
what do you do with a man?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:10%
We know how to handle
guys, but what about men?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So this whole conversation
led into this whole field

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of studying what happens to men
and how they actually change

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
in really predictable stages.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And the change has to do with
what they're focused on, right?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So testosterone
makes a brain focus.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we found out is
that men focus in stages.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Typically.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the things
I've really loved about my work

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
is how much this particular
topic contributes to men.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
hear about it, they

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:90%
have compassion for themselves.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.895 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh, there's
nothing wrong with me.

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it does.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.864 align:middle line:84%
It also contributes to
mothers with sons, hugely.

00:02:58.864 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: It's
also information

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that's useful if you're
going to hire someone.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the stage of development
that they're in will depend

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
upon what they need from their
work and what they can provide

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and what they cannot do, no
matter how you pay them or how

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:90%
you manage them.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest way
to understand it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
is if you start at the stage
that begins at puberty.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And we call those "knights,"
as in knights in shining armor.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%
The boys younger than that--

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
so up till puberty, from birth
to puberty-- they're "pages."

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Camelot.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So pages are the
wannabe knights.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They're learning
how to be knights.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.371 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: They
want to be knights.

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
They dream of their own
horse, their driver's license.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They admire these
young men that are

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:90%
having all these adventures.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
focus of this stage.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's all about adventure,
conquest, conquering, testing

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of oneself, finding
out what you've

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
got, what are you made of,
pitting yourself, against--

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Competition?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes, absolutely.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Competition, just even
challenges-- solo challenges--

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
like a man against a wave.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Man versus wild.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Man
versus wave, right?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the mistakes that
we make with men this age is we

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
try to get them to be
more serious, to be more

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:90%
responsible, to settle down.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now, what age is that?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: So we're
talking from, basically,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:90%
around 12 years old--

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
puberty starts, on average,
11 and a half years old,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
so it could be
nine, could be 14--

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:90%
until late 20s, early 30s.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So mothers of sons
in around there, 12 to 14,

00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
are trying to say
calm down, calm down.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.034 align:middle line:90%
That's never going to happen.

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes,
and teachers are

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:90%
trying to get them to sit down.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Sit down, shut up, and listen.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they get in
trouble if they don't.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.701 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: And
they get in trouble.

00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's, from my
view, it's just cruel.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
We are so not taking
care of our boys

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.009 align:middle line:84%
by not understanding
that their instincts--

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To get up, jump on top
of the desk with their pencils

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.715 align:middle line:90%
and wave them around in the air.

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:24.515 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes.

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it so
they can't do something

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that they don't see they're
going to learn something from,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
gain something from,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.891 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
stronger, better,

00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:33.009 align:middle line:90%
faster, as a result of it.

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we tell
them, just learn it.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:90%
How will I apply it?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Just learn it.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel really fortunate,
as a mother of a son,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to have learned this
when he was real young.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And now that he's
almost 25, that I

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
understand he's still in the
adventure period of his life.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I just support
him in his adventures,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and I listen to his
adventures, and what skill

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is he working on now, and
what is he conquering now?

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I pick him
up from the airport

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
as he comes in from Indonesia
and on his way to Alaska.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not tense that he
isn't got the job that's

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.239 align:middle line:90%
going to be the 20-year track.

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not tense about that.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.115 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worried.

00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I know when he gets--

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.573 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
OK with meeting him

00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
at the airport for that
few hours of connection,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.914 align:middle line:84%
you're great with that,
rather than him coming home

00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
for Thanksgiving or
something, right?

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you staying home?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Why are you-- no.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
He's got to go.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's just good to
know that when he--

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.882 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between 28
and 32 years old--

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
fulfilled, in large part.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Men always need adventure.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Some always need a lot of
adventure, like my dad.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But this focus on adventure,
it'll complete itself,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and then the focus
will shift to building.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So the focus shifts from
adventure and conquest

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and conquering to building.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's when a
man becomes a prince.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And we picked that name
because a prince is not a king.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's painfully
aware of that.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.585 align:middle line:84%
But he's not a
knight any longer.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.334 align:middle line:84%

that's the beginning

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: So how long does
that prince phase last?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: About
a dozen years.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ooh, that's
quite the phase.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%

dozen years from the time

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%

going to build his kingdom?

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so it
could last 20 years.

00:07:57.405 --> 00:07:58.905 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: It
could last 20 years.

00:07:58.905 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It could last 30 years.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It happens in phases.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So the first phase, what
we call an early prince,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.536 align:middle line:84%
he's figuring out what
does he want to be king of?

00:08:09.536 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And he might have to try
a lot of different things.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And he'll think it's in, right?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.875 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be this.

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:90%
And then he's like, ew.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:90%
That is awful.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That could have to
do with jobs, relationships.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Mm.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:90%
This is really about jobs.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Jobs, OK.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.193 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: This isn't
about relationships.

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:26.866 align:middle line:90%
That's a different problem.

00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:27.666 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%
No, I know.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all about distinctions.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:90%
But it affects him.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
Because once he
figures out where

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:84%
he wants to build his kingdom,
then he has another choice.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to build
it alone, or do I

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
want to share the
building with another?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big choice.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And for some men, they already
know what they want to do.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just been obvious
for them all their lives.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
For others-- I know
a man where he really

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
had to stop and think, which
way do I want to do this?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And he could see himself
doing it both ways,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and decided he
wanted to build with.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And so then, those
are the men who,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:90%
they're now middle princes.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They've got enough
accomplishment under their belt

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that they feel like
they're on the path.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:90%
They picked the right path.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
looking around for who's

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:90%
going to come with me?

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to support me?

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Who's going in the
direction I'm going?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Who do I have an advantage
by being tied to that person?

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:90%

a solid 10, usually 12, years--

they feel like they can
let off the gas a little.

in our mother's tummy.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:90%
We have millions of eggs.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So the quality of
the eggs lessens.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
This is when they want
to do amniocentesis

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
because of the
chromosome, birth defects.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So the clock is ticking
because of the loss

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of estrogen because of
the loss of the eggs

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.877 align:middle line:90%

you get so much estrogen.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.068 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And begin your own transition.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:90%
He's going to become a king.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Focus on becoming a queen.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a job for a woman to
do during that period of time.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what "Keys to
the Kingdom" is about.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
So he's going through it.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
She finds a mentor
who supports her

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
in her own process to come out
on the other side together.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or girlfriends or girl
time or mother-daughter stuff.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
shift from nurturing,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
which is what a woman may
have been doing for 15 years,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
to receiving.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when he
comes out a king,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.404 align:middle line:84%
he's going to shift from
building to providing.

00:20:36.404 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When he
comes out of king?

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.403 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: When
he comes out a king.

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So he goes through the tunnel.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%
He goes through the tunnel.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: He goes
through the tunnel.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:90%
It could last six months.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It could last three years.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Some men get stuck
there forever.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
When he comes out, he comes
out with, this is who I am.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want to give.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Who wants it?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And if his woman is still
trying to give to him

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
instead of receive
from him and be

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
willing to admire him and
appreciate him and allow

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:90%
him to provide for her--

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
if she's still saying,
I can do that, no,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.177 align:middle line:84%
I can do that, no,
I can do it, you

00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
don't need to do
that, I can do that--

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
if she's still saying
that all the time--

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:90%
he now needs to provide.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
He's as compelled to
provide as he was to build

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
as he was to seek adventure.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
He needs to provide for someone.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So allow him to
provide, and receive.

00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, it'll blow up.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
He also, when he
comes out a king,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to
tolerate the emasculation

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:90%
that he tolerated as a prince.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a great point.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: That's
another way it blows up.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:90%
So now we get to go from--

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:90%
this is so beautiful.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you have
described this so clearly.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's all--
however-many CD set

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that is of "Amazing
Development of Men."

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all in there.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
My husband's listened to it.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the "Keys to
the Kingdom" book.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But now, you go
through a great stage

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
of explaining what the
cavewoman, caveman,

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
hunter-gatherer
relationship is and how

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:90%
it applies to modern life.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at that in this video

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
to start off with.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:08.675 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Oh,
that'll be great.

00:22:08.675 --> 00:22:09.475 align:middle line:90%
It's a great topic.

00:22:09.475 --> 00:22:13.261 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:16.712 align:middle line:84%
So guys, I want to
relieve you of something.

00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to relieve
you of something.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Because as a hunter, when
someone else is speaking,

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:90%
you have two ways of listening.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:90%
You have two default listenings.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
If they're fine,
you're listening--

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:90%
what's the point?

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
That's where you're listening.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
If they're upset,
you're listening--

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:90%
what's the problem, Right?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Both of these ways
of listening will

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
get in the way of your
relationships with women.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.162 align:middle line:90%
The first-- what's the point?--

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
will get in the way
of your relationships

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
with women because
there is no point.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.273 align:middle line:90%
There's no point.

00:23:04.273 --> 00:23:07.514 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:90%
There's really no point.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.814 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to remember
the berry markers.

00:23:15.814 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to remember the
blue dress or the red dress

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:90%
or 10:15 or 10:20.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
remember any of that.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.605 align:middle line:84%
I recommend, however, that
you notice if it's absent.

00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:84%
If it's there,
everything's fine.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
If she's not giving berry
markers, you're in trouble.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the way that it works is
we tell the people on our team

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:90%
where the berries are.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
In case something happens to me,
McCall can go get the berries.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:10%
But if I don't trust
McCall anymore,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:10%
I won't tell her
where the berries are.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.506 align:middle line:84%
So if a woman says to another
woman, how was the party?

00:24:08.506 --> 00:24:10.422 align:middle line:84%
and she's like,
oh, it was great,

00:24:10.422 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I was wearing my blue dress,
and Susie had her pink one on,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.974 align:middle line:84%
and so-and-so and so-and-so
were there, all's well.

00:24:16.974 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
If a woman says to another
woman, how was the party?

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.822 align:middle line:90%
It was fine-- uh-oh.

00:24:22.822 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
That means I don't trust you.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell
you where my berries are.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.311 align:middle line:90%
You'll steal them.

00:24:33.311 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to give
you any information.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:90%
What were you wearing?

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:90%
A dress.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, who else was there?

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Lack of detail--
alarms should go off.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
If a woman's giving plenty
of detail, all is well.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to remember it?

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, this also causes
problems because as a hunter,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
as the man, not only do
you listen the point,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:90%
you speak the point.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Honey, how was your meeting?

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:90%
How did it go?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:90%
He bought it.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Good, and?

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:10%
Who was there?

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Everybody.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:10%
And what did you say?

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:10%
What I planned on.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, what-- what--
[STUTTERING]??

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, he bought it.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:10%
What else is there to say?

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.062 align:middle line:10%
And we're like [SNIFFLING].

00:25:36.062 --> 00:25:38.542 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to share
your life with me.

00:25:38.542 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.006 align:middle line:84%
You don't-- you don't
really-- he doesn't trust me.

00:25:43.006 --> 00:25:46.974 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.974 --> 00:25:48.462 align:middle line:90%
He won't include me.

00:25:48.462 --> 00:25:51.934 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.934 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, she'll pick a fight,
and something terrible happens.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happens.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sharing your
berry markers with me,

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:90%
you must not trust me.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.994 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a
hairy woman, you know?

00:26:04.994 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:90%
You've got to remember that.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:90%
You're a hairy woman.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.015 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sharing your berry
markers, you don't trust me.

00:26:11.015 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's devastating.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So again, bringing it
back to what can you do?

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:84%
As a man, you don't have to
remember the berry markers.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Remember there's no point.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.957 align:middle line:84%
It's in the messages
she trusts you.

00:26:24.957 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As you were
saying, back then,

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have camera phones.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.869 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Right.

00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My husband goes to
the market, takes a picture.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Is it this one?

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank god for those things.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.376 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: It's a miracle,
an absolute miracle.

00:26:36.376 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because why
are we so specific?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, and it just explained it.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we'll kill the
meal or the village if--

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%
God forbid.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
So how do you send--

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
or even get a guy to go to
the market in the first place

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
without having to ask him
and send him with a list?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever happen?

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I never see that in the market.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Some men go to the market.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Well,
for a long time,

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought Greg wasn't
allowed in the market.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he'd go without
bread for three days,

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and it would never occur
to him to go buy some.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:90%
That was my job.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's reversed.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, he goes to the market.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But what's really cute is he
always gets the same things.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aha, yes.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: So I go to
the market looking at all

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:90%
the possibilities, right?

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: No.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Single focus.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:84%
He gets the exact same things
over and over and over again.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And that works.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
He calls it keeping
the wheels on.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So he keeps the wheels on.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:90%
We all stay fed.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.619 align:middle line:84%
If I want something different,
I need to go to the market.

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
a good solution.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I know my husband does the same
thing-- the same staple things.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And he needs those things.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I go to the
market and forget those things.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.997 align:middle line:84%
So it's a rule-- always
go get hot sauce.

00:27:51.997 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're at the
market, just get hot sauce.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.845 align:middle line:90%
Wherever you are, get hot sauce.

00:27:55.845 --> 00:27:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: I didn't know
John was into hot sauce.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He loves hot sauce.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: That's great.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't look like
a hot sauce guy.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
good thing to know.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's totally
a hot sauce guy.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: All right.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.803 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: I don't know.

00:28:06.803 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
He's just adorable.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He is.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So now, the meadow report.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to
the meadow report.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.345 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Oh, my gosh.

00:28:13.345 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And can we teach people how not
to trigger the meadow report?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the meadow
report in the first place?

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Well,
the meadow report

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is what I named a woman's
compulsion to report back.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
She went out into the
world, and she comes back,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and she's got to tell
you everything she saw,

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:84%
everything she thought,
everything she felt,

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
everything that was going
on with everybody else.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That everyone said.

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.837 align:middle line:84%
And then they said
because she said.

00:28:42.837 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Mm-hmm.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
The whole report.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then she
said, and then she--

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And we're compelled to do that.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
really interesting is,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
again, it goes back to
this thing about accuracy

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and about diffuse awareness.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So because of a
commitment to accuracy,

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and because diffuse awareness
connects me to everything

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and actually has me identify
with everything, when you

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:90%
say to a woman, how are you?

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
she's got to accurately
report on how she is.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So she has to tell
you her mental state,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.027 align:middle line:84%
her physical state, and
her emotional state.

00:29:27.027 --> 00:29:28.985 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what happened
to make you that way.

00:29:28.985 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: And how each
one of the people who

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:90%
are important to her are.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Because how they are is
part of how she is, right?

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So she's going to report
on all these things.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, how are
you? takes a half an hour--

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With women.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: --more-- to answer.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And so one of my favorite
things to teach people

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.557 align:middle line:84%
is how to not trigger
the meadow report.

00:29:49.557 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Berry markers are
about time and place.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Where is it, and when
do I need to be back?

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:90%
When and where, right?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Berry markings is all about
the distinguishing details.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what?

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:11.395 align:middle line:84%
You can't just bring any old
berry back from the meadow.

00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:12.623 align:middle line:90%
You could kill us.

00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:16.004 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.004 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Some berries are poisonous.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.606 align:middle line:90%
Some berries taste awful.

00:30:20.606 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.275 align:middle line:84%
You gotta bring home
the right berries.

00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:90%
You gotta bring home the berry.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a little blue berry.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's got five
little knobs on it.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And it grows on a bush that's
never higher than this.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.524 align:middle line:90%
And it's always next to a river.

00:30:42.524 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's never going to be in
the middle of the meadow--

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
ever, ever-- that's
the poisonous one.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:84%
You want the one that's
always next to the water.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And if it's taller than
this, it's the wrong one.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:90%
No, that one tastes awful.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It's always on a short bush.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:90%
And the leaves are glossy--

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:90%
not the fuzzy-leafed one.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.164 align:middle line:84%
You guys, you're already
going [WHISTLING]..

00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
This is life and death.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.445 align:middle line:84%
You gotta bring home
the right berries.

00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't get to the market.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I need you to get
the tomato paste.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't just get
any old tomato paste.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
You gotta get the
one with basil,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.022 align:middle line:84%
but Contadina with basil,
not Del Monte with basil.

00:31:42.022 --> 00:31:43.798 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of sour.

00:31:43.798 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It'll wreck the whole meal.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.319 align:middle line:84%
So it's the one with the green
label with the red stripe.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's always about
a third of the way up

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom of the stack.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And first, you'll
go down the aisle

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
past the cranberry juices
and the apple juices,

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll get
to the canned goods.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first section
is tomato sauce.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Not sauce-- I need paste.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.294 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So go past the sauce until
you get to the paste.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the black
label with the green stripe.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the wrong stuff.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.415 align:middle line:90%
Now, this thing happens, OK?

00:32:24.415 --> 00:32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said
I'd tell you if we

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
think if we stop talking in the
middle of sentences or ideas,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
something terrible
is going to happen?

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So we know, there's a list about
this long of berry markings

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that would adequately describe
the right tomato paste.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We know all the things
we need to tell you

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.150 align:middle line:84%
about how to get the
right tomato paste

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:90%
and find it in the meadow.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:84%
We get about this
far down the list.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We say, like, two things,
and you say, I got it, right?

00:32:53.780 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The tension in our
bodies, right, ladies?

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just goes berserk.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
We're just like--
it's such a conflict.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
saying anything more

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.534 align:middle line:90%
is really going to tick you off.

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And then my life
will be in danger,

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.734 align:middle line:90%
which I'll explain later.

00:33:19.734 --> 00:33:21.775 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't give you
the rest of the details,

00:33:21.775 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
you might bring home the
poisonous tomato paste.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.814 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll kill
the whole village,

00:33:25.814 --> 00:33:29.062 align:middle line:84%
and so my life is in
danger that way, too!

00:33:29.062 --> 00:33:30.918 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:33:30.918 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So you know what we
usually like to do?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Call me when you get there!

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.705 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Just forget it.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.814 align:middle line:90%
I'll get it myself.

00:33:41.814 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.535 align:middle line:90%
Or we'll try to--

00:33:45.535 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
let me just tell you a
couple more things about it,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
just a couple more things--

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
try to sneak in a
couple more markings.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:10%
How many of you can relate?

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Most men's brains are not built
for the detail of a meadow

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.409 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They could care less.

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Their brain
just isn't built for it.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And they try to remember
the details, which,

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.741 align:middle line:84%
if they remember to not
remember, then they'll do OK.

00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a skill.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.115 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah,
that's a skill.

00:34:13.115 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
But it's much better, instead,
to ask her the questions

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that instead of tapping
into the meadow report tap

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:84%
into what she's
passionate about.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So explain.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: OK.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman is talking about
what she's passionate about,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
it actually causes for a man to
have a surge of testosterone.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may sound
scary to some women.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But testosterone is actually
what makes men feel good.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the hero comes out.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.433 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: The hero comes out.

00:34:43.433 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
It gives him a
sense of well-being

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:90%
that they can handle anything.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Men with low levels
of testosterone

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:90%
are the cranky ones.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The high levels--
they're in good shape.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're the providers.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:90%
They want to provide.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.640 align:middle line:90%
They want to provide.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yes.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So testosterone's not
something to be afraid of.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So when a man's
listening to a woman talk

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
about something she's
passionate about,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.050 align:middle line:84%
he has a surge of
testosterone, and he

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
gets a sense of
well-being, which

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is the opposite of what
happens to him when

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.601 align:middle line:90%
she's giving the meadow report.

00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, aah, right?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So he's got to start
asking the right question.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's got to start
with finding out from her,

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:90%
what is the right question?

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So I have a friend.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The right question for her is,
what have you learned lately?

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So she asks that?

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: No.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:35.847 align:middle line:90%
That's the question to ask her.

00:35:35.847 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, ask her.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: If you ask her,
what have you learned lately?

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:90%
she'll come alive.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Because she loves
to learn, right?

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:84%
If you ask me, when are
you going to Colorado?

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you're excited.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:90%
You are excited about that.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Right?

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.125 align:middle line:84%
And you just tap
into my passion.

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Or ask me about
my horses, right?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
[WHOOSHING] I'm going
to go right there.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
most important things

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to find out about any
woman and every woman

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:84%
is what does she love
to be asked about?

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And not only that it
taps into her passion,

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but it has her feel like,
wow, you remembered me.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:90%
You care about me.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.099 align:middle line:90%
You're interested in me.

00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So just go
ahead and ask her,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
what do you like
to be asked about?

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And you would instantly
come up with Colorado.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I would instantly come up with
parenting or biking or whatever

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:90%
my passions are.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:26.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hear from
some of the men now.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
We want to take a look at
this video from a male's

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.021 align:middle line:84%
We've got two women
talking the whole time.

00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what a male's
perspective is about all

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.804 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:36:36.804 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
situations that

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:84%
come up that refer to
these berry markers.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend that
came over to our house,

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and she had a issue
in her relationship.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:10%
And she started to go on and
on, and it was this berry marker

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:10%
kind of thing.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.630 align:middle line:10%
And I knew that she
needed to just do this,

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.505 align:middle line:10%
but it never stopped.

00:36:56.505 --> 00:37:00.390 align:middle line:90%


00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
realize, you know what?

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting frustrated.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.694 align:middle line:90%
And I was, OK, keep going.

00:37:06.694 --> 00:37:08.318 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, I
say, all right, fine.

00:37:08.318 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We've done the berry marker,
but let's go to some kind

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.465 align:middle line:84%
of solution-based system
because otherwise--

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understand you
need to release tension.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.802 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, you keep
running in circles.

00:37:21.802 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Because all you're
doing is talking

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
about the berry
markers, berry markers.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And you never get anywhere.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.179 align:middle line:84%
Because the next day,
it's the same problem.

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And you keep talking just
about the berry markers

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.132 align:middle line:84%
without ever getting to the
place of OK, let's deconstruct.

00:37:33.132 --> 00:37:34.256 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what can be done.

00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:35.545 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Can I have
you pause a moment?

00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:36.345 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:36.345 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: I have a word
for what you're describing--

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.973 align:middle line:90%
torture, right?

00:37:42.973 --> 00:37:43.955 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is hard.

00:37:43.955 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Ladies, that is how
you torture a problem solver.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's mean.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.485 align:middle line:90%
It's totally mean.

00:37:51.485 --> 00:37:54.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Remember, earlier, I said men
have two default listenings?

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:84%
If we're fine, it's
what's the point?

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
If we're not fine, it's
what's the problem?

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is another way where
our communication gets out

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:90%
of sync.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Because as a woman,
what happens to us,

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.190 align:middle line:84%
as a woman, because we're
gatherers, is our basket

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:90%
gets full.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It gets very full.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
unload the basket.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.503 align:middle line:84%
And how we unload the basket is
just [GIBBERISH] and then I--

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:26.961 align:middle line:84%
and did that and
then, we did that,

00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and then we did
that [GIBBERISH]..

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.942 align:middle line:90%
I call it a meadow report.

00:38:34.942 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a meadow report.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be a cave report
if we had to stay home all day.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to report.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And when the problem
solver is listening,

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the problem solver wants to
analyze the problem in order

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to be able to solve it.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So you will ask
clarifying questions.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you ask
that clarifying question,

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.920 align:middle line:84%
it would be the equivalent
of someone's throwing up

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and someone catches it in
a cup and pours it back

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:90%
down their throat.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.878 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE GROANING]

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.715 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going
to remember this.

00:39:11.715 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.686 align:middle line:90%
It really does that.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:90%
It goes-- [GAGGING SOUNDS].

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're like
[MUFFLED NOISES]..

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:90%
So what to do about it.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:84%
One thing, for the ladies, could
you hear how tortured he was?

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Stop doing that to them.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.159 align:middle line:84%
Your girlfriends can take it
for about 10 times as long,

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
tell you to shut up.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.162 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.162 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're not going
to break up with him,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:84%
at least stop
complaining about him.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
They'll eventually say that.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:84%
For you, when a woman
is giving her meadow

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
report, what I try
to tell men to do

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:84%
is just remember,
hold the bucket.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm just holding the bucket.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.150 align:middle line:84%
This is how she's
going to get peaceful.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
This is how she's going
to actually have space

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:90%
to give a damn about me.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.510 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:90%
She's making unoccupied space.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Just hold the bucket.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Hold the bucket.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Hold the bucket.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask any questions.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.750 align:middle line:90%
What else about that?

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:90%
What else about that?

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I strongly recommend
a time limit.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.245 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.245 --> 00:40:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You've
got 10 minutes

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to give me that meadow report?

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:28.896 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.896 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: I
asked Greg, honey,

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.686 align:middle line:84%
how long can a man
tolerate the meadow report?

00:40:34.686 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
How long of a meadow
report can you tolerate?

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, 15 minutes
if we're dating.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.692 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Meaning I'm on my
best behavior 'cause

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you're the deer I'm
trying to catch.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: That's funny.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.061 align:middle line:84%
Alison's sitting here
watching herself, laughing.

00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it's situational
comedy is what it is.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You need to have your
own stand-up Vegas show.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just what we all go
through every day of our lives.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Nobody puts it into such
good words and explanation.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%
So I hear other women do this.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the carpool.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I pick up my daughter.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:90%
She's in the car.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Her friend will
come up and say, hi,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and just blah, blah, into the
window, all over my daughter.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't need
to know all of that.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I hear women do the
meadow report to me,

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and I get nauseated sometimes.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.622 align:middle line:90%
So poor men.

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.330 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the
kitchen cooking dinner,

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and we just blah,
and they're like,

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to watch
football or something.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do we cut back
now that we know that we

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:90%
have the meadow report in us?

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.215 align:middle line:84%
How do we cut back that need
for that precise detail--

00:41:48.215 --> 00:41:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because if I leave
it out, then I

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.330 align:middle line:84%
might leave out a
piece of the evidence

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that you could solve
the mystery with?

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Well, the
point of all of this

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is what I would call
instinct plus choice.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you know you
have an instinct that

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:84%
compels you to be
accurate, that compels

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:15.240 align:middle line:84%
you to report on yourself, that
compels you to give details,

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
then you can go, OK, and what's
going to make a difference?

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.940 align:middle line:84%
What do I really need
him to know about me?

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:90%
He has a limited capacity.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
What do I need him
to know about me?

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:84%
What will matter that
he knows about me?

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.811 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But sometimes, as women,
we just need to talk it out.

00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I talk a whole
scenario out of a problem

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that I want him
to solve, but I've

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.261 align:middle line:84%
solved it by the time I've
gotten to the end of talking

00:42:38.261 --> 00:42:40.120 align:middle line:90%
about all the perspectives.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: OK.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing to do there,
it's all about setting him up,

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you tell a
man, just listen--

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.260 align:middle line:90%
this is really bad news, OK?--

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
if you tell a man, just listen,
he has a hormone in his body

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that will turn the
testosterone into estrogen.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:84%
He's being emasculated
at the biological level.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I figured out

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.066 align:middle line:84%
from teaming up with John
Gray from "Men Are from Mars."

00:43:11.066 --> 00:43:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you just
don't do this to men.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.981 align:middle line:90%
You call your girlfriend.

00:43:13.981 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Do not
tell men, just listen.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
they can't do it.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But you have to set
them up differently.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So what you say
instead is, you can

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:27.010 align:middle line:84%
help me solve my problem
if you let me talk out

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:90%
all my thoughts about it.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brilliant!

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: If you would
just be the blackboard

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and let me talk this
out, you'll help me.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
By becoming clear
about the problem,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll help me get
clear about the problem.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:84%
By the time I'm
done talking it out,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll either have the solution or
I'll know what to do to get it.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Would you help me like that?

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, then, he's
sitting there.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, he's focused.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Talk it out.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Talk it out.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Talk it out.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Talk it out.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Be the blackboard.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Be the blackboard, right?

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's not
turning into a girl.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.770 align:middle line:90%
He's providing.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
He's protecting you
from that problem.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.904 align:middle line:90%
He's providing the blackboard.

00:44:01.904 --> 00:44:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is great.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.736 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the point
in that first video.

00:44:04.736 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:90%
There is no point.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no point to
the conversation.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Just listen.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.060 align:middle line:90%
But he's listening to help her.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So that activates
all the masculine.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:84%
He's not listening,
cooling his jets.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Help her.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It will change everything.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:90%
He'll win.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:90%
He'll be all pumped up.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The testosterone surge
will come up in his body.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll smell it because
we can smell testosterone.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.546 align:middle line:90%
You'll get turned on.

00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:34.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:44:34.345 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Oh, yeah.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, seriously?

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.066 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Oh, yeah.

00:44:37.066 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:90%
You're talking it out.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.090 align:middle line:90%
He's providing for you.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:84%
By the time you're
done, that was foreplay.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow!

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:90%
It's solved.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Problem solved for both.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
shifted it from,

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.370 align:middle line:84%
just listen to, help me by
letting me talk this out.

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Once again, difference
of communication.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, one of the
biggest traps men fall

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
into is when women say, do
I look fat in these pants?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Do not ever do that
to your man, right?

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: That's so mean.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so mean.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: It's so mean.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, we want them
to be honest, right?

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
We'll bust him for
not being honest,

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:84%
but then we ask him
something like that, right,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying
what we really need,

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:23.340 align:middle line:84%
which is, I'm having a little
attack of self-esteem not doing

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:90%
so good.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm having the worst possible
feeling a woman could ever

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:90%
feel-- the feeling of fat.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling we do
everything to avoid.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So could you tell me
what's beautiful about me?

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Or could you remind me
why you love my butt?

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Or ask for what we need.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Could you save me from
myself by telling me

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:90%
what a great butt I have?

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.384 align:middle line:90%
Then he can charge in.

00:45:50.384 --> 00:45:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Distract me, please.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is why we are so
tortured by that question.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.575 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:45:57.575 --> 00:45:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: We're
highly adaptable.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how we survive.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That's how a woman survives
is by being highly adaptable.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We will be anything we
think we need to be.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But the back of the hand
is weak sense of self.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.935 align:middle line:90%
We lose ourselves like that.

00:46:20.935 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:84%
[SNAPPING] And women
say this all the time.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:90%
God, I lost myself in that job.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I lost myself in
that relationship.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.240 align:middle line:90%
I lost myself in my family.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Ladies, raise your hand
if you relate to this.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.550 align:middle line:90%
You lose yourself.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Keep your hands up.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:90%
You want the guys to see this.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.590 align:middle line:90%
We lose ourselves all the time.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.580 align:middle line:84%
We have such a
weak sense of self.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
This is why we're so
affected by criticism.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:84%
When a man is criticized,
you measure the criticism

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.480 align:middle line:90%
against yourself.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.430 align:middle line:90%
We just [GAGGING].

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.520 align:middle line:84%
We're overwhelmed
by the criticism.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
externally motivated.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There's two things that make
us externally motivated.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:84%
One is what I just talked about,
that we think our life depends

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:90%
upon pleasing you.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to become
whatever will please you.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that makes
us externally motivated

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:90%
is diffuse awareness.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.990 align:middle line:90%
You tell us who I need to be.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:84%
My environment tells
me what I need to do.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:31.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't pick.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Your criticism tells
me who I need to be.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And my environment tells
me what I need to do.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't choose.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:48.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't decide.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So yeah, we're
tortured by criticism

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.655 align:middle line:84%
all around us, let
alone our own criticism.

00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to hear
it from anyone else, right?

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah, and
we hear criticism in,

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:10%
the green beans are
salty, which to a man

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:10.730 align:middle line:10%
would be a statement of
fact, not a criticism.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And we're so different.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Men and women-- as it talks
about in the video, criticism

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.010 align:middle line:84%
just goes right in and
causes us to change.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Men have all these layers
of protection, do you know?

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.590 align:middle line:10%
And we've heard
them talk about it.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:28.070 align:middle line:10%
So when a man gets criticized,
the first thing he does

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.872 align:middle line:10%
is consider the source.

00:48:30.872 --> 00:48:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
a man say that?

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.365 align:middle line:90%
Well, consider the source.

00:48:33.365 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:35.151 align:middle line:90%
Look who said that.

00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing he does
is consider the source.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.125 align:middle line:84%
If he doesn't
respect the source,

00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:44.326 align:middle line:90%
it was like they passed gas.

00:48:44.326 --> 00:48:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Say, hmm.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.092 align:middle line:90%
A little stinky, then it's gone.

00:48:47.092 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Doesn't matter.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.883 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Really.

00:48:48.883 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It has no effect.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's someone
that they respect,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, now it's worth considering--

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:84%
still not acting
upon, but considering.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And how they consider it
is they check the criticism

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:84%
against the sense
of their self, like

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I talk about in that video.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:09.710 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't fit their
sense of themselves--

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't agree-- then
it's just regretful

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that someone they respect
thinks that of them.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, that's too bad.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:90%
If they do agree--

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.380 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, he really has
a point, I am that way--

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.840 align:middle line:90%
he still doesn't act on it.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Now it's just up to be measured.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
advantage of changing that?

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.840 align:middle line:84%
How much effort would it
take to change that, right?

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a huge
advantage to changing it,

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.414 align:middle line:84%
now it goes on the
list of things to do.

00:49:40.414 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean he's
going to do it now.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear all the layers?

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: It just goes
on the list of something

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.030 align:middle line:90%
that would be worth changing.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.400 align:middle line:84%
If the benefit of
changing it does not

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:84%
outweigh how much energy
it would take to change it,

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:84%
then it's like, yeah, that's
something wrong with me.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Criticism
changes women.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
It changes women.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And as a man, it's
something to understand.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you may not have
meant to change her.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:13.710 align:middle line:90%
She wears a blue dress.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And you say, you
look prettier in red.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:22.310 align:middle line:84%
She'll never wear a
blue dress again--

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:90%
never, not around you.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.187 align:middle line:90%
Can't do it.

00:50:27.187 --> 00:50:28.520 align:middle line:90%
She puts her own life in danger.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Women know this.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.330 align:middle line:84%
How you change another woman
is you just criticize her.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.107 align:middle line:90%
You go, Mary, really?

00:50:37.107 --> 00:50:37.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got red hair.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:90%
You're wearing pink?

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.272 align:middle line:84%
Mary could never
wear pink again.

00:50:43.272 --> 00:50:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding, by the way.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe women with red
hair should wear pink.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.054 align:middle line:90%
Honest to goodness, I do.

00:50:50.054 --> 00:50:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But really, that's
all someone has

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to do is just say that,
and boom, she's changed.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So guys, you can start to
make this connection, right?

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.320 align:middle line:84%
If criticism changes
a woman, who do we

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.553 align:middle line:90%
think criticism will change?

00:51:02.553 --> 00:51:03.531 align:middle line:90%

That's why we criticize you.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to change you.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're shocked
that you don't change.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.580 align:middle line:84%
We're just stunned
that you don't change.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.965 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.965 --> 00:51:23.765 align:middle line:90%
But you don't.

00:51:23.765 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:90%
You don't change with criticism.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:84%
All criticism does to
you is causes distance.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.810 align:middle line:90%
That's all it does.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just, whoa.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Not safe here.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't like me.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not OK with her.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:36.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It just causes distance.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My wonderful husband,
who is incredibly perfect,

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:90%
does one thing--

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:90%
one thing that bugs me.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Only one thing.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:44.998 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Only one thing.

00:51:44.998 --> 00:51:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But he wears the same
tattered tank tops to parties.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: To parties?

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I've
bought him many shirts.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.550 align:middle line:90%
He's going to kill me for this.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.140 align:middle line:90%
But how do I gently say--

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.720 align:middle line:90%
other than, watch the show--

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:84%
how do I gently say, would
you wear another tank top?

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Because he doesn't care.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:84%
He is who he is, at
home, at a party.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:13.760 align:middle line:90%
He could care less.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.990 align:middle line:90%
And I love him for that.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So I've never said
anything because I don't

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.100 align:middle line:90%
want to hurt his feelings.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's not
about the tank top.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.737 align:middle line:90%
But I'm talking to you about it.

00:52:22.737 --> 00:52:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Because maybe it is.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.110 align:middle line:90%
So how does--

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.443 align:middle line:90%

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd love you to do this?

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.646 align:middle line:84%
You're perfect the way you
are, but if you did this,

00:52:31.646 --> 00:52:32.600 align:middle line:90%
it'd be awesome?

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Well, yeah,
it's all about points.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:40.174 align:middle line:84%
So honey, you know when
you wear the green shirt

00:52:40.174 --> 00:52:41.840 align:middle line:84%
or the blue shirt,
and we're at a party,

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and I see you across the
room, I get turned on.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aha.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:90%
That would work.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: That turns me on.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would work.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: When you're
in your old tank tops

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:51.788 align:middle line:84%
that you wear at
home, I understand

00:52:51.788 --> 00:52:53.832 align:middle line:84%
why you wear them at
home, but at a party,

00:52:53.832 --> 00:52:55.040 align:middle line:90%
it just doesn't do it for me.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Now there's an upside for him.

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:01.922 align:middle line:84%
Now there's something
worth doing.

00:53:01.922 --> 00:53:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rewards.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:04.940 align:middle line:90%
That is a very good point.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:90%
That is a very good point.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:07.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.113 align:middle line:84%
We just have a few
minutes left, but I

00:53:09.113 --> 00:53:11.330 align:middle line:84%
want to go to a subject
that is pressing

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:14.450 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of people's
hearts, where money comes

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.900 align:middle line:90%
in the way of a relationship.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It becomes the third party.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's too bad.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when money
has disrupted a relationship

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.770 align:middle line:90%
to the point of--

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.622 align:middle line:84%
what advice could you
offer around that?

00:53:32.622 --> 00:53:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: And you want
the 30-second version, huh?

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.496 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, we've got
about two minutes.

00:53:36.496 --> 00:53:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: We've
got about two minutes.

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:40.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So what the problems are are
problems of associating money

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.120 align:middle line:84%
with power, that who makes
the money is the person who

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.470 align:middle line:90%
gets to make decisions.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.730 align:middle line:90%
That will kill partnership.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Another problem is
one of accountability.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So women feel safe when other
people are being accountable.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Women feel free when other
people are being accountable.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's things we want to be
accountable for because that's

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.250 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of when my
husband was retired for four

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:84%
years, I didn't mind
that I was the one who

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.140 align:middle line:84%
was making the
money, but I still

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:90%
needed him to be accountable.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.272 align:middle line:84%
And there were things that
were his job, and he had them,

00:54:28.272 --> 00:54:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have to pay
any attention to them.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was providing
that for me.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.330 align:middle line:84%
That made me feel
like I was better off.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately-- and probably
why 2/3 of the divorces

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.450 align:middle line:84%
in California are
initiated by women--

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:46.070 align:middle line:84%
when a man isn't providing
an equal or greater income,

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.056 align:middle line:84%
and he isn't filling
it in with being

00:54:48.056 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:84%
accountable for
other things that

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.120 align:middle line:84%
make a difference in her
life, she'll start to think--

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.090 align:middle line:84%
true or false-- that she's
better off without him.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's bad.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.139 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so communication--
well, listening to this

00:55:00.139 --> 00:55:02.570 align:middle line:84%
is the first piece, and then
communicating about how can

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:05.660 align:middle line:84%
you and I provide equally
in the relationship--

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:84%
not having to do with
anything financially--

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.390 align:middle line:84%
just how can we
support each other?

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ARMSTRONG: Yeah.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.170 align:middle line:84%
You need to look at
accountabilities.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, when
men don't have jobs,

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:18.147 align:middle line:84%
they still need to be
at work on something.

00:55:18.147 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great point.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARMSTRONG: Because that is
what spends the testosterone.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what has them
smell good to us.

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.555 align:middle line:90%
That's what earns our respect.

00:55:27.555 --> 00:55:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to produce money,

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.596 align:middle line:90%
but they have to be at work.

00:55:30.596 --> 00:55:31.440 align:middle line:90%
They're generating.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.230 align:middle line:90%
They're providing something.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as you can see,
it's all about smelling good.
