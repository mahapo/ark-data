>> Lisa Garr: Hi.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.394 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today believes
that fast foods, and fad diets,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and a lack of time
or knowledge has led

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.236 align:middle line:90%
to America's obesity epidemic.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.272 align:middle line:84%
Healthy lifestyle expert,
Danette May is my guest.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:42.375 align:middle line:84%
And her solution is a cookbook
she calls, "Eat, Drink,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.144 align:middle line:90%
and Shrink," and it's a cookbook

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.681 align:middle line:84%
for busy people using
five ingredients or less.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:90%
My kind of cookbook [laughter].

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.952 align:middle line:84%
However, Danette is more
than just a healthy cook;

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:54.988 align:middle line:84%
she's an inspiration to
us in many, many ways.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:55.989 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here today.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: Thank
you for having me, Lisa.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Have you always
been into health and fitness?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.262 align:middle line:84%
Has this been your
lifelong journey?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: Yes, I've
always been into health.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:09.603 align:middle line:84%
And, I guess, at an early age,
I kind of knew within my heart

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.906 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be using
this as my catalyst in my life,

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.742 align:middle line:84%
and -- but I've not always
been a healthy person.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, I
mean, because sometimes...

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Danette May: Yeah.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: ...we
need an inspiration,

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.782 align:middle line:84%
some model out there that gives
us an idea of what health is.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you have that
model when you were...

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: I
absolutely did not.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Did not.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: No,
and so, like, for me,

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.189 align:middle line:84%
I used to think health
was having, like,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.825 align:middle line:84%
reduced fat Wheat Thins
and Yoplait yogurt.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:32.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Ah.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: But I
have learned, and I --

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.761 align:middle line:90%
after having three kids,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I look and feel better
than I did before...

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Amazing.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: ...because of
learning these help things,

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.401 align:middle line:90%
and movement, and all of that.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So, okay, so
what type of -- then you --

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.872 align:middle line:84%
you got into the fitness
industry, and you teach people.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.275 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest concern
that people come to you

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.312 align:middle line:84%
with when they seek you out as
a trainer or your information?

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Danette May: What
I think most people

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.349 align:middle line:84%
when they seek me out,
they're kind of like everybody.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.186 align:middle line:84%
For especially women, it's
I want to look better.

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle line:84%
But it's -- what I help them
with is not that you just want

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.458 align:middle line:84%
to look better on the outside,
because it's deeper than that.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.427 align:middle line:84%
We say, "I want to lose
20 pounds," but, really,

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.029 align:middle line:84%
why do you want to
lose 20 pounds?

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.865 align:middle line:84%
It's -- you know, I'm
finding that people,

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:90%
if you dig a little deeper,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.669 align:middle line:84%
then they know why they
actually are seeking me out is

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.205 align:middle line:84%
to feel confident,
to feel on purpose,

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.739 align:middle line:90%
to self-love themselves...

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.608 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...and to feel
wanted and desired.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:22.142 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.277 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So it comes down to that.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:84%
So, you help people really
get fit from the inside out,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.615 align:middle line:84%
rather than just what
they see on the outside.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.817 align:middle line:90%
I try to hit that first.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.087 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's only so much
that you can do when you --

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.355 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
the physical body.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.991 align:middle line:84%
You can't spot reduce; you
have to look at the whole,

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.726 align:middle line:90%
entire package, right?

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.127 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:44.129 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I think when you
say the whole, entire package,

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.901 align:middle line:84%
once again, we think about
this outward body of ours,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.936 align:middle line:84%
but that's not overall
health, right?

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.073 align:middle line:84%
It's really about -- I think,
right now in our world,

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:57.177 align:middle line:84%
we're spiritually starved,
and so we fill up with food.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.679 align:middle line:84%
So fill -- we're feeling there's
a void, and we don't know how

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.515 align:middle line:84%
to fill it up, and a lot of
people are filling it with food.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.551 align:middle line:84%
And if we can take care
of that, it kind of takes

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:84%
out all the drama that goes
around with the outside,

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.389 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm eating,
and what I'm not eating,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.124 align:middle line:84%
and am I moving,
am I not moving.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.259 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.727 align:middle line:84%
Do -- now, do you have
a spiritual practice,

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.427 align:middle line:90%
a daily spiritual practice?

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:16.028 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:16.563 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You do.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.498 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What do you do?

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.899 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And its make all
the difference in my world.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.402 align:middle line:84%
Like when I said I feel and look
better after having three kids

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.537 align:middle line:84%
than I did before; even when
I was still on this health

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.874 align:middle line:84%
and fitness road, it's
completely different.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:31.544 align:middle line:84%
One thing, I always wake
up and have a moment

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:90%
of gratitude; whatever that is.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.516 align:middle line:84%
And that, literally takes 10
seconds, because I'm the mom

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.084 align:middle line:84%
that they're waking me
up sometimes [laughter].

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.219 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, yeah [inaudible].

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And before I craw
out of bed, you know,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.288 align:middle line:90%
I might touch their hand,

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.889 align:middle line:84%
and I say three things
I'm grateful for.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.658 align:middle line:90%
I always start with that.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:45.992 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And then, maybe there's
a bustle of the day going,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.129 align:middle line:84%
you know, getting
them out the door.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.499 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm just working, and
then I take a minute to spend

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.468 align:middle line:84%
in meditation or prayer,
and do that every day.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.971 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, I mentioned
earlier that Danette is more

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.006 align:middle line:90%
than just a fitness expert.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.742 align:middle line:84%
You've had an incredible
story that you --

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and an incredible hardship
that you've come through,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that most people wouldn't have
come through to do what you do,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.919 align:middle line:84%
and all the inspiration
that you are.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.055 align:middle line:84%
And I have so much
respect for you.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
If you wouldn't mind
sharing your story with us,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and how you dug yourself out
of a deep, deep depression.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.228 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Okay, yeah.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.965 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's -- it's really
-- I look back on this --

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.467 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think sometimes
when we go through hard things,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.302 align:middle line:90%
you wonder why in the moment.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.403 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going through?

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.239 align:middle line:84%
Why me? But now that
I'm past that moment,

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.142 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking back, I know
why I needed to go through that.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:36.676 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You do?

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.044 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: I do!

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.146 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that there's a
message that I need to share.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.381 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.882 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And I feel like
there was that moment going

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:90%
through that was kind of an Aha!

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.953 align:middle line:84%
moment for me, where I
was, like, I've always been

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.589 align:middle line:84%
into health and fitness; I've
always been interested in it.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.893 align:middle line:84%
And -- but now I see
how this truly heals.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:54.694 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, okay.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:55.829 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Truly heals.

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:58.031 align:middle line:84%
So, my experiences is,
is about five years ago,

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I was pregnant with
my second child.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.437 align:middle line:84%
And I was always really
sick during my pregnancies,

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.806 align:middle line:90%
bed-ridden, can't move.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.742 align:middle line:84%
It's called hypernemesis,
where you throw up,

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:10.477 align:middle line:90%
literally, about 10 to 15 times.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my God.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.246 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah, so very, very sick.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to take, like,
[inaudible] cancer medications,

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.117 align:middle line:90%
to keep the throw-up down.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:17.817 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:18.918 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Crazy.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.421 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: But, ready to
have my second child,

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:25.425 align:middle line:84%
and went into the hospital
so excited, as every new --

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:29.629 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're excited, you've
endured so much sickness and,

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.299 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, he passed
away at the hospital, and...

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.468 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: After you
gave birth and...

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:36.836 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.571 align:middle line:84%
Just during that whole process,
it really stunned everyone.

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.572 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.906 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: It was one
of those moments.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:43.476 align:middle line:84%
Even doctors were, like, I
don't know what's gone wrong;

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:44.544 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And in those moments,
you go, "Why?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.517 align:middle line:84%
Why?And, you know, I don't know
that necessarily had an Aha!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.451 align:middle line:90%
moment in that time.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No, I'm sure.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:52.952 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.555 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I mean, it's -- it was
probably so shocking to you

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.324 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't looking
for the why at that point.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: No, I was just,
you know, for me,

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:06.066 align:middle line:84%
I've always been really pretty
happy person, and loved to move,

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.367 align:middle line:90%
and loved to be outside.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:11.137 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself for
months literally not wanting

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.505 align:middle line:90%
to get out of bed.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.008 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
know if I knew I was

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.544 align:middle line:84%
in a depression,
but obviously I was.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:22.882 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember the day
that I was, like, I really need

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.517 align:middle line:84%
to get out and go for
just a walk around.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.885 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're body's
gone through all the...

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:26.886 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well, you were still...

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...changes
of having a baby.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.954 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.355 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.656 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you were -- you were
still probably producing milk,

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.191 align:middle line:90%
you...

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.592 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:35.528 align:middle line:84%
My body ached to have this baby,
so it was a constant reminder,

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
not only emotionally,
but physically.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was very, very
difficult at that time for me.

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:43.369 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those moments
for me where I was, like, wow,

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.305 align:middle line:90%
I've been dealt my card.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And what am I going
to do with this?

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.841 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my gosh.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.142 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.644 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you came home,
and you were -- you just --

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.481 align:middle line:90%
you came home without a child.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:58.818 align:middle line:84%
You came home, in that moment
when -- what did you do?

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: In that moment, I
didn't do much, you know,

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:06.359 align:middle line:84%
I was in a survival
mode, and I didn't move.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.395 align:middle line:84%
I didn't eat sometimes;
I maybe ate

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.298 align:middle line:84%
if someone brought
something to me.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:15.702 align:middle line:90%
I just was in kind of a fog.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:18.271 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, were you a fitness
teacher before this, or?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.472 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.641 align:middle line:84%
I had always done fitness,
and I think that's kind

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:25.678 align:middle line:84%
of what I believe is, like,
it's really easy to be involved

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:27.947 align:middle line:84%
in exercise and be like, okay,
I'm going to eat this and this,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.682 align:middle line:84%
when everything in your
world is going great.

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:32.285 align:middle line:84%
And it was easy for me
to teach people that

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.523 align:middle line:84%
and to share this message and --
but it wasn't until I was, like,

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:40.193 align:middle line:84%
whoa, like, my body is
so far out of alignment.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:44.097 align:middle line:84%
I am totally out of shape;
I don't feel good; I --

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:47.634 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, physically, all
those things, and spiritually.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, yes.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.703 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: What am I going to do?

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:53.239 align:middle line:84%
And I -- you know, this is
where all this comes about,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.174 align:middle line:84%
because I went out
-- I decided to go

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
for a walk just around my block.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.013 align:middle line:84%
And it -- I always
say it sounds cliche,

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.115 align:middle line:84%
because it really was
that moment for me.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:05.084 align:middle line:84%
Because everything -- I, like,
remember the houses I passed;

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I remember the birds singing,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.324 align:middle line:84%
and it was like my heart was
opening, literally, just opening

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.392 align:middle line:90%
for the first time, and it...

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.626 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Hadn't felt
for that long.

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.028 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.896 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: How long after you came
home did you go for that walk?

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.198 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Probably around
three months.

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:19.899 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.633 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Three months...

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.834 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...of really not
wanting to talk to people.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.736 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Uh-uh.

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.738 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I didn't really
know what to say, you know?

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.507 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about
your child at home?

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.708 align:middle line:84%
You had a daughter
already, right?

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:29.676 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah [brief laughter].

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And she was how old?

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.212 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: She was around
four, yeah, at the time.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.914 align:middle line:90%
Four, four and a half.

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it was really difficult
for her, too, you know,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.152 align:middle line:90%
I always call her an old soul.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:43.089 align:middle line:84%
She was going through her
own mourning, as well.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.057 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my God.

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:46.292 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: So, you know
it's bad to say,

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.394 align:middle line:84%
but I don't even remember
what she was doing

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.196 align:middle line:84%
in those three months,
poor child, but...

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.098 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.232 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's an
important point,

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.034 align:middle line:84%
is that she was grieving,
you were grieving.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:58.371 align:middle line:84%
Who has the tools to
handle something like that?

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.107 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who has those tools?

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.676 align:middle line:84%
It's very challenging
in that moment.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:08.081 align:middle line:84%
So, just by going on that walk
and beginning to feel, and hear,

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:11.417 align:middle line:84%
and smell again, was just one
baby step at a time, right?

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, and I knew, like
I said, it was like this Aha!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:19.092 align:middle line:84%
moment of -- I knew
and, you know,

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.693 align:middle line:90%
you know that movement heals.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.762 align:middle line:84%
You know movement
cures depression.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:84%
You hear it, but until you go
through it, and you feel it,

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.002 align:middle line:84%
you're like, this is really
true, and this is what's going

00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.503 align:middle line:90%
to heal me, is moving.

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.639 align:middle line:84%
And I just started with
walking around the block.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.439 align:middle line:90%
That's all I could do.

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.341 align:middle line:90%
And it was, like, I see now,

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.477 align:middle line:84%
I see how this is
going to heal me.

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:40.413 align:middle line:84%
I see what other people
must be experiencing,

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.915 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling it
for the first time.

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:47.787 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, too, that I needed
to eat well to get through this,

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.889 align:middle line:84%
that I needed healing
energy foods

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.558 align:middle line:84%
to not just make me look
good -- I was out of shape --

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.761 align:middle line:84%
but to make me feel
good spiritually,

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.263 align:middle line:90%
and whole, and heal, basically.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.866 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so, between the
movement and the walking, it --

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.801 align:middle line:90%
and the walking, and the foods

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:05.538 align:middle line:84%
that you knew made you feel a
little bit better, how long did

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:08.775 align:middle line:84%
that take you to start to feel
alive again, to start to feel

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.944 align:middle line:84%
like you want to go even
out in the world again?

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.647 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You know, it
really -- it's amazing.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:15.848 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take that long.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It doesn't?

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.118 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: If you really feel the
difference of not feeling good,

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:23.523 align:middle line:84%
and then you start just three
days of eating alive food --

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:25.024 align:middle line:90%
food that's energy driven.

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Three days.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.861 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Three days and just
moving, I got a little bit

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of that, "Mm, yes,
I want to do this.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:90%
I feel this."

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.833 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I was all
happy again [laughter].

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.634 align:middle line:90%
But I was...

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.902 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well, yeah.

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:36.869 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I was actually feeling
it within myself enough

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:39.138 align:middle line:90%
to go, "This is what I want.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.074 align:middle line:90%
This is what I need to share."

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.076 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Did it get any
easier at that point?

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:45.345 align:middle line:84%
Did you still have a
rocky path to go through

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:46.646 align:middle line:90%
and things to deal with?

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.414 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You always
-- you always do.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:52.452 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if you are dealt
with the hard card such as that,

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:53.986 align:middle line:84%
those are going to
be other ones, right?

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.655 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
dealt other things.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.323 align:middle line:90%
Life is life, and --

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.026 align:middle line:84%
but I realized I am so
much more equipped to deal

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:02.361 align:middle line:84%
with the hard things in
life when I have, you know,

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:05.698 align:middle line:84%
good movement and good,
healthy food in my arsenal.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.232 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.567 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.235 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, let's take a look
at Danette in action here.

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.437 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.071 align:middle line:84%
>> [Video] [Background
Music] Hi!

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.473 align:middle line:90%
Danette May, here.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:16.809 align:middle line:84%
Today, I want to share with you
some tips on portion control.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:19.212 align:middle line:84%
What I'm really finding when
people are starting to adjust

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:22.181 align:middle line:84%
into trying to get
healthier, to lose weight,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.183 align:middle line:90%
is they lose track on portions.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.686 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really know
what a correct portion is.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.221 align:middle line:84%
You know, you see, oh,
I need to eat three

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.056 align:middle line:90%
to four ounces of protein.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:31.557 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:34.961 align:middle line:84%
And how do I measure all this
if I'm traveling all the time?

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:36.362 align:middle line:84%
I know it can get
really confusing,

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.031 align:middle line:84%
but portion control is
really, really important

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.734 align:middle line:90%
if you're trying to lose weight.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:45.004 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies really don't need
as many calories and as big

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
of amounts as we really think
we should have [laughter].

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.641 align:middle line:90%
It needs less.

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.409 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have one
recommendation,

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.812 align:middle line:84%
is to choose a smaller
plate to eat with.

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.046 align:middle line:90%
That's really going to help you.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.216 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't eat a
whole plate full --

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.218 align:middle line:84%
the standard plates that
you buy at the store.

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.821 align:middle line:84%
You should choose what they
usually call a salad plate

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.589 align:middle line:90%
to put your dinner portions on.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:04.757 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.059 align:middle line:84%
The next tip I'd like to
use is just your hand.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.529 align:middle line:84%
Your hand is portable; it's
the easiest measuring device

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:10.797 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:12.565 align:middle line:84%
So, when someone mentions
that you should have three

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.302 align:middle line:84%
to four ounces, like I usually
do in my book, of protein,

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:19.772 align:middle line:84%
that is the size of your palm;
the thickness of your palm,

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:22.108 align:middle line:90%
and the size of your palm.

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:84%
Or, you can use the
estimate of a deck of cards.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:29.882 align:middle line:84%
That is three ounces of meat
-- of protein, of red meat.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:34.187 align:middle line:84%
If I'm mentioning a
tablespoon of fat, that would be

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
about the size of the
tip of your thumb,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.891 align:middle line:90%
so a tablespoon, all right?

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.259 align:middle line:84%
I know some people have
bigger hands or not,

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.294 align:middle line:90%
but that gives you a --

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:42.695 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be
so strict with it.

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:46.699 align:middle line:84%
I think people get so carried
away with being so exact,

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.201 align:middle line:90%
that it takes the fun out of it,

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:49.902 align:middle line:84%
and it makes you
feel so regimented.

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:52.605 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't meant to be
regimented if you just kind

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.739 align:middle line:90%
of take those equations.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.042 align:middle line:84%
If I say a handful,
just take a handful.

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:57.643 align:middle line:90%
It's not heaping, right?

00:12:57.643 --> 00:13:00.246 align:middle line:84%
It's just a handful of
nuts, and there you go;

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.748 align:middle line:84%
you've got a great snack
and protein source.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:06.352 align:middle line:84%
A cup. So, I like to, like,
hold my hand like this.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.956 align:middle line:84%
And that -- filling up
that cup inside my hands is

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.357 align:middle line:90%
about approximately a cup.

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:15.695 align:middle line:84%
If I mention a cup of veggies,
that's about a cup of veggies.

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:19.632 align:middle line:84%
So, these just is simple tips
that you can do to really stay

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.502 align:middle line:84%
on track with losing weight and
staying within portion control.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.539 align:middle line:84%
Just remember, stay on top
of your journey; you're going

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.207 align:middle line:84%
to get there; you're
going to learn it.

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:30.676 align:middle line:84%
It's just like riding a
bike; it's hard at first,

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.778 align:middle line:84%
but then you become
super-efficient at it,

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.447 align:middle line:84%
and just remember
you have your hand,

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.515 align:middle line:84%
and it's portable,
and just have fun.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:41.921 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.023 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you made this
cookbook, basically,

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.092 align:middle line:90%
for people like me who are busy.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:47.894 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know how to cook.

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't follow
recipes that well [laughter].

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.499 align:middle line:84%
I don't follow directions
that well.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.401 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of having
something that's

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.104 align:middle line:84%
under five ingredients
really was helpful to me.

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:00.172 align:middle line:84%
Why did you create
something like that?

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You know, I really wanted
to -- my message, really, is,

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.346 align:middle line:84%
you know, you might
think, "Okay,

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:84%
she's helping me lose weight
so I could be a bikini model."

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.417 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:14.587 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to show you that
you can eat clean for healing.

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.155 align:middle line:84%
And all that will
come into play.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:19.158 align:middle line:84%
You will look good after it, but
don't let that be your focus.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.595 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
sacrifice on, you know,

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
all your time and
all your money.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.731 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do diet pills.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
starve yourself.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You can eat six times a day,
and you can do it simply.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.405 align:middle line:90%
Five ingredients.

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:34.206 align:middle line:84%
And save time at
the grocery store,

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.908 align:middle line:84%
save time in the
kitchen, and save money.

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:36.842 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.177 align:middle line:84%
So, in the essence
of saving time,

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:39.946 align:middle line:84%
that's sometimes
all I have time for,

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:41.514 align:middle line:84%
is just to put a
few things together

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that are identifiable foods,
and then either pack it up,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:84%
walk out, pack it
in a lunch book --

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.687 align:middle line:90%
box, do what I need to do.

00:14:47.687 --> 00:14:50.289 align:middle line:84%
You did all of this
as a single mom, too.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:50.989 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:52.091 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of why.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:55.328 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who -- I really
wanted to eat clean.

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:58.364 align:middle line:84%
We want -- we wanted -- we know,
okay, let's eat clean, you know,

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.833 align:middle line:84%
we wanted -- so, I would
get these recipe books,

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.436 align:middle line:84%
and they would be, like,
14, 15 ingredients...

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...and pretty
complicated.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.939 align:middle line:84%
Looked like it would
take me about an hour

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.808 align:middle line:84%
to prepare something
that tastes delicious.

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:10.776 align:middle line:84%
And I was, like, I do
not have this time.

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:14.113 align:middle line:84%
I'm a single mom; I've
got to use my time wisely.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.716 align:middle line:84%
So, I was, like, I want
to create something;

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:19.752 align:middle line:84%
I want to create recipes
that -- five ingredients.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.587 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, I want to touch
on that for a second.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:26.759 align:middle line:84%
Now, you had your first daughter
who is -- was in your life,

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.196 align:middle line:84%
and then your second child was
the one that did not make it.

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:32.698 align:middle line:84%
Now, during that time, you
also went through a divorce?

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.767 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my God, girl.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:38.537 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah and really, this
is what got me through it.

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:39.372 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Really?

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:42.274 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Being absolutely, 100%.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.277 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I had more
energy eating this way.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:49.181 align:middle line:84%
I felt more alive, because
that stuff brings you down.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:50.549 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I get -- yeah.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.152 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And I knew through my
first hard experience that --

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.854 align:middle line:84%
and with, just like I
said, those three days

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:56.689 align:middle line:84%
of eating clean, I
already kind of had

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:90%
that intellect in my mind.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.892 align:middle line:84%
I was like, when I
make this choice --

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.595 align:middle line:84%
it's not always easy to make
the healthy choice sometimes,

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
but when I get to
make that choice,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.565 align:middle line:84%
and I make it, I
have more energy.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.068 align:middle line:84%
I feel better about
myself, because when you go

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.337 align:middle line:84%
through a divorce,
there's so much negativity

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.705 align:middle line:90%
that comes into your mind.

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:13.539 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You are your worst enemy.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.274 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.409 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And, yeah, so
it just helps you.

00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:18.744 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But to go through
that, and to really show

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:21.547 align:middle line:84%
that you needed energy
to make good decisions;

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:25.918 align:middle line:84%
you needed resilience; you could
have easily gone to a place

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:28.754 align:middle line:84%
of stress and back into
a place of depression.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.122 align:middle line:90%
And you think that you didn't

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.491 align:middle line:84%
because you were supporting
yourself with movement and food.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.393 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I absolutely,
100%, believe that.

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.094 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's beautiful.

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:36.162 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: I know it's true,

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.496 align:middle line:84%
and I want to share
that with everyone.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.398 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's your
message to the world, girl.

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.199 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is your message,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.867 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you're
here [laughter].

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:43.069 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: [Inaudible].

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Because I want you
to tell that many people

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.339 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need to
go through these things

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.576 align:middle line:84%
and never climb out, that
there are choices, that someone

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:54.413 align:middle line:84%
like you has been able to do
this, and that this is how.

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:84%
And all of the great things
about eat this and eat that,

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get into that.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But your story is so
powerful for people to know

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.288 align:middle line:84%
that you're more than just
a healthy chef [laughter].

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.557 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Thanks, [inaudible].

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:06.624 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You've been through
an insane amount of stress

00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and pressure, and
you've come through it,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.929 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
pretty phenomenal.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Thank you so much.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.431 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, well you
did it [laughter].

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And I really hope
that someone realizes that,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.138 align:middle line:84%
that you can heal, and food and
exercise will help you heal.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.506 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, they
will now [laughter].

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:23.308 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I want you to
take a look at some of the foods

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.577 align:middle line:84%
that Danette says
that you should --

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that are energy producing
foods that really did help her.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.482 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:30.616 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: [Video] [Background
Music] Hello everyone.

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:34.186 align:middle line:84%
Today, I want to share
with you the five foods

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.988 align:middle line:84%
that I always have
in my kitchen.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.557 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, is because
they are a great food option

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:41.961 align:middle line:84%
if you want to slim down your
body, keep up your energy,

00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and also help with your
skin, the way you look,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.602 align:middle line:84%
and the way you feel, has so
many nutrients, but you can do

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:90%
so many things with them.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.276 align:middle line:90%
So, let's get started.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:03.015 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
I love is lemons.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:08.821 align:middle line:84%
I always have lemons
because I start my day off

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:12.191 align:middle line:90%
with lemon water.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.193 align:middle line:84%
I take warm water,
cut a lemon in half,

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.427 align:middle line:90%
squeeze it, and drink it.

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.795 align:middle line:84%
It balances your pH levels,
which ultimately helps

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:17.897 align:middle line:84%
with blemishes and the way your
body reacts to burning fat.

00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:19.265 align:middle line:84%
So, start my day off
with fresh lemon water

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.766 align:middle line:84%
and also use my lemon in my
green drinks that I usually have

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:84%
after my lemon water or as
a snack throughout the day.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.269 align:middle line:84%
Lemons are awesome to
put on salad dressings.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.204 align:middle line:84%
Such a great product
and easy to use.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:26.906 align:middle line:90%
The second thing is spinach.

00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:90%
I always eat spinach every day.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.011 align:middle line:84%
And it's because it's super
simple, and it tastes good.

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:33.979 align:middle line:84%
So, I can always
have a spinach salad.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.982 align:middle line:84%
I can throw on whatever
protein choice I want,

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:40.553 align:middle line:84%
spice it up with some craisins,
some nuts, and a little bit

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:43.556 align:middle line:84%
of feta cheese, and you've
got a delicious lunch.

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:84%
Also, I use spinach in all
my smoothies for my girls

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:49.361 align:middle line:84%
and myself, because it masks
well; you don't taste it.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:50.496 align:middle line:84%
They never know that
it's in there,

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.131 align:middle line:84%
and I know they're
getting all the nutrients.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.667 align:middle line:84%
So, spinach is a
must-have in the kitchen.

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.569 align:middle line:90%
The third thing is eggs.

00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:58.204 align:middle line:84%
I always laugh because
people think

00:18:58.204 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that cold cereal is your
quickest option for breakfast.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.641 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that we're
hurrying out the door.

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:07.112 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I've timed
it; eggs are just as quick

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:09.915 align:middle line:84%
as pouring a cold [inaudible]
of cold cereal and some milk.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:12.451 align:middle line:84%
You can just crack your egg,
and it's loaded with protein.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.721 align:middle line:84%
I usually put just a little
bit of spinach in a skillet,

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.991 align:middle line:84%
crack a couple eggs in there,
and then spice it up with curry,

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.426 align:middle line:84%
which is my favorite; you can
choose whatever spice you want.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:24.096 align:middle line:84%
And it is done, literally,
in two minutes.

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:26.532 align:middle line:84%
So eggs is a wonderful
way to start your day

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.834 align:middle line:90%
and have on hand at all times.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.804 align:middle line:84%
My fourth item is, I think,
is a very understated product

00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.405 align:middle line:90%
and item [laughter], is quinoa.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:38.444 align:middle line:84%
Quinoa is a wonderful protein
source, and it actually looks

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:39.812 align:middle line:90%
like a grain, but it's not.

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:84%
So, it's gluten free, and you
can prepare it like a grain.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:45.517 align:middle line:84%
So, I'll just make a big batch
in the morning, some mornings,

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:48.687 align:middle line:84%
and actually either use
it in place of oatmeal.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:53.325 align:middle line:84%
So, I'll just scoop it out, put
a lit bit of cinnamon, nuts,

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.529 align:middle line:84%
some fruit, and there you have
a wonderful breakfast item.

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.667 align:middle line:84%
You can also use this
in place of pasta,

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:05.104 align:middle line:84%
so I'll take fresh tomatoes,
little bit of olive oil,

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.672 align:middle line:84%
fresh basil, and a
little bit of sea salt,

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:09.875 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a delicious
dinner item, as well.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:13.345 align:middle line:84%
The other -- the last
product that I love to have

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.582 align:middle line:84%
in my kitchen at all times is
raw, unsalted variety of nuts.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.452 align:middle line:84%
My very favorite are
walnuts, almonds, and cashews.

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:22.921 align:middle line:84%
They are the quickest snack
that you can actually have,

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.424 align:middle line:84%
because you just can grab
and go, and they're going

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.928 align:middle line:84%
to keep you full, and they're
actually a really good health

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:30.529 align:middle line:90%
for you -- healthy fat for you.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.264 align:middle line:90%
So, just take a handful.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.768 align:middle line:84%
That's all you need, and you
are set for your snack choice.

00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
You guys go ahead and
grab all these items today

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.438 align:middle line:90%
to put in your kitchen.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:90%
And remember, you're worth it.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.645 align:middle line:90%
That just, I mean, you just --

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.447 align:middle line:84%
all this information just
rolls off your tongue.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.182 align:middle line:84%
I -- okay, I want to get
through a couple of things here,

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.885 align:middle line:84%
because your story is,
again, so fascinating to me.

00:20:52.885 --> 00:20:56.055 align:middle line:84%
And you have -- when did you
do the fitness model stuff?

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.057 align:middle line:84%
Your -- I know that
you're a fitness model,

00:20:58.057 --> 00:20:59.925 align:middle line:90%
bikini model, model model.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:00.826 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.062 align:middle line:90%
Actually, after my third child.

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:06.298 align:middle line:84%
Like, I truly believe,
and I'm telling you this,

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.401 align:middle line:84%
that when you eat
clean, and when you move,

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.036 align:middle line:90%
and when you add spirituality,

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:14.039 align:middle line:84%
meditation into your
life, the world opens up.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.842 align:middle line:84%
The universe answers your call
of intention and your purpose.

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:19.578 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what this
is about; aligning ourselves

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:20.579 align:middle line:90%
with our purpose, right?

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:84%
I was in the top 10
of the world bikini --

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:26.218 align:middle line:90%
and I'd never done it before.

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:29.088 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to try something
that completely scared me.

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:31.423 align:middle line:84%

on stage in a bikini
after having three kids.

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.964 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm going
to enter the biggest one,

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
because if I don't, I will
pull out at the last minute.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.069 align:middle line:84%
I know I will, because it's
easy to sign up for, like,

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.572 align:middle line:84%
a local one and be, like, "I
can't make it" [laughter].

00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.974 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: But I was like, okay,
I'm going to pay a lot of money,

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:50.743 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to enter
the world's, and...

done it before?

only one -- they mentioned it,

00:21:54.847 --> 00:21:56.815 align:middle line:90%
because it was on ESPN.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.183 align:middle line:84%

has never been --

00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:00.953 align:middle line:84%
she's our only contestant has
never been to a show before.

00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:03.822 align:middle line:84%
And it was -- it's
really a beautiful thing,

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.824 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't --
I was just trying

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:06.959 align:middle line:90%
to prove something to myself.

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.961 align:middle line:84%

see if I could do it

>> LG: So, what are three carbs

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:37.689 align:middle line:84%
that you should eat
to lose weight?

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.858 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, first up, I want
to say, because there's a lot

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:90%
of misconception around this.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.162 align:middle line:90%
You should eat carbs.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.132 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Carbs are not bad; it's
just eating the right carbs.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.267 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: They're brain
food, aren't they?

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:49.468 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they really do help you.

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:50.536 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah, absolutely,

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:52.671 align:middle line:84%
and they fuel your
muscles, and it's good.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.306 align:middle line:84%
Brain food, I love you
say that, because those

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:56.842 align:middle line:84%
who are not eating carbs
are going around fuzzy.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.143 align:middle line:90%

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.445 align:middle line:84%

ornery; as I say, hangry;

00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:01.346 align:middle line:84%
they're hungry and angry at
the same time [laughter].

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:02.915 align:middle line:90%
And it's miserable [laughter].

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.049 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.451 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: So, please eat
your carbs [laughter].

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:06.285 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:07.386 align:middle line:90%

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:09.421 align:middle line:84%
Energy for the brain
and fuel for the brain.

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:10.756 align:middle line:90%
What kinds of carbs, though?

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:11.857 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Okay.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
My favorite three are
legumes and lentils,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.528 align:middle line:90%
okay, so beans [laughter].

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.332 align:middle line:90%

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.468 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Sweet potatoes.

00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:23.869 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And how -- how do
you prepare those, though?

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:26.905 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Sweet potatoes, I pretty
much just keep it pretty basic.

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.774 align:middle line:90%
You just bake it in the oven --

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:30.108 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
do anything with it.

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:32.711 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the oven, walk
away, and then you can --

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.012 align:middle line:84%
you can put different
things in there.

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:37.282 align:middle line:84%
Some people like to put more
of an Indian spice to it,

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:39.518 align:middle line:84%
like curry, if you're
going in that mood.

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.186 align:middle line:84%
And some people are just
a salt and pepper --

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:42.254 align:middle line:90%
sea salt type of person.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:43.822 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Or a cinnamon person.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:44.723 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Cinnamon, yes.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:45.691 align:middle line:90%
That's an excellent choice.

00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:47.025 align:middle line:90%
You want a little sweeter side.

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:47.826 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:48.861 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: So, you get to choose

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.662 align:middle line:84%
with sweet potatoes,
and I love quinoa.

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:54.099 align:middle line:84%
Quinoa is more protein, but it
digests in the body like a carb,

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
so it's an excellent source

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.169 align:middle line:84%
because it's full
of amino acids.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh!

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.372 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And it kind of takes
the texture like oatmeal,

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:03.141 align:middle line:84%
so you can cook it like an
oatmeal, and then you --

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.943 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot better of a source.

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.411 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I was scared of
quinoa for a while; A,

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.347 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know how to
cook it; and second of all,

00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:09.314 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was going

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:12.317 align:middle line:84%
to exacerbate my
gluten sensitivity.

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.085 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:14.419 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It didn't; for me.

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:16.154 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Absolutely not, because
it doesn't have any gluten

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:17.389 align:middle line:90%
in it, right?

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yup, and so
that was great for me.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.658 align:middle line:90%
So, how do you cook it?

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:22.294 align:middle line:90%
Just basic quinoa cooking tips.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:22.861 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Okay.

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:23.529 align:middle line:90%
All you -- yeah.

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:24.296 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You soak it.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: No.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.931 align:middle line:90%
No soaking.

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.699 align:middle line:84%
You just do like you
would rice, pretty much.

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.169 align:middle line:84%
So, put -- like, if I was going
to cook one cup of quinoa,

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:33.338 align:middle line:84%
I put one cup of quinoa
in, two cups of water;

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:34.706 align:middle line:90%
boil it for 20 minutes.

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:36.408 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to drain
anything; it's done.

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:37.609 align:middle line:90%
It's light and fluffy.

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.544 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to go.

00:24:38.544 --> 00:24:40.045 align:middle line:84%
And I like to make
a bigger batch,

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.413 align:middle line:84%
and then I put some
in the fridge.

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:43.482 align:middle line:84%
So then you could take it, and
you can make it like a lunch

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.117 align:middle line:84%
with it, put some
spinach in there,

00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:47.553 align:middle line:84%
some craisins, some
feta, olive oil.

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.855 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Then you have
that for lunch.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.523 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another
section that you can use for,

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:84%
more, breakfast, where
I put cinnamon in there

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:56.028 align:middle line:84%
and some nuts for, like,
that breakfast type cereal.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:56.695 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, okay.

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:57.529 align:middle line:90%
So you just use it.

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:58.897 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: And its super portable.

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:01.066 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you can send it in
lunchboxes, you can send it.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.034 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:03.101 align:middle line:84%
You can eat it cold,
and it -- yeah.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have all those
amino acids, too.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.939 align:middle line:84%
So, you're getting all the
nutrients, and you're slimming

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:09.041 align:middle line:84%
down your waistline, and
you have more energy.

00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:10.075 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Mm.

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.109 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you -- you
said it's portable.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:12.978 align:middle line:84%
Do you pack six different
meals a day,

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:15.781 align:middle line:84%
as your busy day goes along,
or how do you do that?

00:25:15.781 --> 00:25:18.016 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You know, for
example, flying here.

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.218 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:20.485 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: People wonder,
what are you going to do?

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:21.453 align:middle line:84%
You're getting up really
early [laughter] to fly here.

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.487 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:23.889 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: What do you
have for breakfast.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:26.525 align:middle line:84%
I had a peanut butter bite that
I'll show you how to make later.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.726 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:28.994 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: That, which has all
the nutrients you need.

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.463 align:middle line:84%
It has your protein, your
carbs, your fat source.

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And then I have, like, a
green, like, green packet drink.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So, it has all your -- and
we can talk about that --

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.105 align:middle line:84%
but it has all your, like,
wheat grass, spirulina,

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:41.106 align:middle line:90%
and it comes in a pack.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.841 align:middle line:90%
You pour it in water; drink it.

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:43.408 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh!

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:44.242 align:middle line:90%
Okay, perfect.

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.377 align:middle line:90%
So, that's your -- your easy...

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:46.378 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You don't have -- yeah.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:47.779 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...travel
convenience [inaudible].

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.982 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And then, maybe I would
take nuts later on, and then --

00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:52.384 align:middle line:84%
you know, you don't have
to make it difficult.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:53.285 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay, so.

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:54.386 align:middle line:90%
Let's see here.

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.588 align:middle line:84%
Do you use a protein
source for every meal?

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:57.356 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:25:57.356 --> 00:25:58.757 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You do.

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And I think that is the
key for energy and weight loss.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.429 align:middle line:84%
And it -- when I
say protein source,

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.064 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
have to be meat.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.899 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
people that are, like,

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.701 align:middle line:84%
they associate protein
with meat, you know?

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:10.936 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.471 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so you can do a
vegetarian protein source...

00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:13.305 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes, but you should have.

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.506 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: ...like?

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Like hemp seeds
or chia seeds are a great

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:17.909 align:middle line:90%
protein source...

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:18.677 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh!

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.045 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: ...that are vegan.

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.347 align:middle line:84%
So, you can -- but just make
sure you're getting a protein

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.483 align:middle line:84%
source, because it
keeps you fuller longer.

00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:27.719 align:middle line:84%
It keeps those hormone balances,
the blood sugar is balanced out.

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:28.387 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:29.087 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes, so.

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:29.888 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's good.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.692 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course exercise
is a huge part of this as well.

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:35.827 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is something
that you have taken on.

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you exercise every
single day of your life?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.699 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Okay, this is what also
I want to say about exercise,

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:84%
because when -- if I
say exercise to you,

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:46.805 align:middle line:84%
do you think 50 minutes to an
hour in the gym when I say that?

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.173 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: When I say exercise,
I never exercise for an hour.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.044 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You don't?

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:52.544 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Ever.

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:53.178 align:middle line:90%
No! No!

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:53.745 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You don't.

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Okay [laughter].

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.549 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I exercise -- I
say I exercise every day

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.751 align:middle line:84%
because every day I
get out in nature.

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:03.155 align:middle line:84%
And I include a walk around
the block as exercise.

00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:07.693 align:middle line:84%
I include going for a bike ride
with my daughters as exercise.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:08.994 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:09.961 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: But I always do some
type of strength training

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.196 align:middle line:90%
at least three times a week.

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:14.833 align:middle line:84%
And you only need to
spend 15 minutes a day

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.935 align:middle line:90%
to have a bikini body.

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.837 align:middle line:84%
I -- that's how I won
the World's Bikini.

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.173 align:middle line:84%
I -- not won it, but
was least in the top 10.

00:27:21.173 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Goodness.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.341 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Doing this program.

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.877 align:middle line:84%
It's all about efficiency, and
it's all about being effective

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:84%
with your efficiency and not --
you don't have to do the hour.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:30.415 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
made that rule up.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:30.982 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.084 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I know.

00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:33.418 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Because it's
not true, and that's --

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:34.453 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people give up right
there, with that thought.

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:35.821 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.322 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I don't have an hour,
so I'm not going to exercise.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.458 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you can do
a 20-minute bike ride

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:41.293 align:middle line:84%
with your kids, or you could
do a walk around the block,

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:44.296 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to do -- at
least three or four days a week,

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:47.432 align:middle line:84%
you can do that, and you can
still keep your body in shape?

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.567 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yup.

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:49.968 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And lose weight
if you eat correctly.

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:52.337 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yes, but I want to say
you should incorporate some type

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.072 align:middle line:84%
of strength, so doing
some functional training.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.108 align:middle line:84%
You don't need weights; you
don't have to go to a gym.

00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:57.142 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.176 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You can do
functional training.

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.111 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, here's
an example of some

00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:00.579 align:middle line:84%
of Danette's functional
training.

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:01.847 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:84%
>> [Video] [Background
Music] Hi, I'm Danette May

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.517 align:middle line:90%
at sixweekworkout.com.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.153 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to give
you your ab movement.

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.622 align:middle line:84%
So, what I'm going to have you
do is get down into a plank.

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
plank crossovers.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.061 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful movement to
do if you have a bad lower back

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.396 align:middle line:84%
but you want to create
great abs.

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:21.533 align:middle line:84%
So, your hands are directly
below your shoulders.

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:24.069 align:middle line:84%
You're in a nice plank
position, abs are pulled

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.203 align:middle line:90%
in towards your --

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:27.572 align:middle line:84%
you bellybutton pulled
in towards your spine.

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.574 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
your knee and cross it

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:31.143 align:middle line:90%
to the opposite elbow.

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:33.745 align:middle line:90%
If you can touch it, awesome.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:39.484 align:middle line:84%
But get as close as you
can, and then release.

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Switch to the other side.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.792 align:middle line:84%
This is going to create a
nice transverse abdominal

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:49.795 align:middle line:84%
strengthener, which creates a
nice, tight ab with the look

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:50.929 align:middle line:90%
that you're all going for.

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:51.863 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go for
about 15 to 20 of these,

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.198 align:middle line:90%
and you'll start to feel it.

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:54.432 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy this movement today,
and remember you're worth it.

00:28:54.432 --> 00:29:02.407 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.642 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Okay, so I
got to ask you,

00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:05.977 align:middle line:84%
do those fitness
infomercials really work?

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.913 align:middle line:84%
I've tried everything
[laughter].

00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You really
have [laughter].

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.081 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I've done
the [inaudible] ads;

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.449 align:middle line:90%
I've done a lot of them, yeah.

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.951 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Did you see
results with them?

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:15.086 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I did, but it
wasn't sustainable for me.

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.521 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.123 align:middle line:90%
I did the three-month program.

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:20.559 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Okay, let's pick on
[inaudible], because yes,

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.895 align:middle line:84%
I actually used to be an
executive for Icon, which was --

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:26.064 align:middle line:84%
is the largest distributor
of fitness equipment.

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So, I had to study every
single infomercial,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.902 align:middle line:84%
because we were creating
equipment for infomercials.

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.238 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: P90X, for example.

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.639 align:middle line:90%
Great concept.

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.708 align:middle line:84%
It is a great program; you are
going to get strength building.

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.877 align:middle line:90%
But it's 90 minutes.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:39.544 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:40.178 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: If you don't.

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:41.012 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: That's not sustainable.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.113 align:middle line:90%
We don't always.

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:43.081 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:43.648 align:middle line:84%
I had to stop after
a while, yeah.

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.518 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of get bored
because it's 90 minutes,

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:47.752 align:middle line:90%
and that's [laughter] --

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:50.121 align:middle line:84%
that's why it doesn't
work; it's not sustainable.

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.957 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's also hard to
get ready for 90 minutes,

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:54.025 align:middle line:84%
because you have to prepare
your day for 90 minutes,

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and you blow it off if it's

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.062 align:middle line:84%
in your house [laughter]
by yourself.

00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:58.363 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Exactly.

00:29:58.363 --> 00:29:59.865 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, a lot of
them are junk.

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:02.033 align:middle line:90%
Like, I think of -- in 2011,

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:07.439 align:middle line:84%
the biggest fitness piece
was the Shake Weight.

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:08.139 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.541 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Not effective.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:13.111 align:middle line:84%
So that certainly doesn't really
work for what it was claiming,

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:16.147 align:middle line:84%
but it was the number
one seller in 2011.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:16.781 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.149 align:middle line:90%
So what does work?

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:20.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you said earlier,
the four days a week doing...

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You know, yeah.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
What works is one; 80
% of what you eat --

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.959 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
80 % of your results.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So what you eat is the
most critical thing.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.899 align:middle line:84%
Abs are truly made
in the kitchen.

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:34.866 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Huh.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:35.533 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.801 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:39.738 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So can you just eat
correctly and not exercise

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:41.973 align:middle line:84%
and still have the
results you want?

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:44.476 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Depends on the results
because for me, personally,

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:46.378 align:middle line:90%
I believe in that whole package.

00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:47.779 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about your body.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.815 align:middle line:84%
It's about your mind,
your heart, and your soul.

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:51.983 align:middle line:90%
Do you want ultimate health?

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:53.785 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel good,

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
it's about not just looking
good, but feeling good.

00:30:56.888 --> 00:31:01.493 align:middle line:84%
So, I recommend 15 to 20
minutes of effective movement

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:03.795 align:middle line:84%
at least three times
a week at the minimum.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.431 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're eating and
you're cooking and so forth,

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:08.099 align:middle line:90%
you talk about mindful eating.

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.935 align:middle line:90%
What is mindful eating?

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:11.903 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Mindful eating,
in my opinion --

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:14.506 align:middle line:84%
cause you can talk about it,
you might have heard about it --

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:16.908 align:middle line:84%
it was when you just
think about your food --

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.209 align:middle line:90%
what's going in your mouth.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:19.044 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:19.577 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: That's one piece of it.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:20.345 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.379 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: But the other piece

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:24.883 align:middle line:84%
to me is what you do
put on your plate.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Because, ultimately our body
tells us what it wants --

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.021 align:middle line:90%
are you listening to your body?

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:33.792 align:middle line:84%
Are you really loving yourself
enough to give yourself the best

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:36.494 align:middle line:84%
of what your body needs
to live its purpose,

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:39.431 align:middle line:84%
to have enough energy, to have
enough clarity in the mind?

00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:41.967 align:middle line:84%
That's the first step
of being mindful.

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:42.934 align:middle line:90%
What do I put on my plate?

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.235 align:middle line:84%
What do I put in
my shopping cart?

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.504 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that.

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:48.873 align:middle line:84%
So, if you were to go into
someone's kitchen right now --

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:50.175 align:middle line:90%
what would you throw away?

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:50.942 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Not much.

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Like, what are some

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.378 align:middle line:84%
of the things you
would just throw away?

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, not to the fault
of someone in their kitchen

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.148 align:middle line:84%
because media has
done an awesome job

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
of misinforming us
-- and its marketing.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.819 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're trying
to sell their product

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:02.253 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing a good job.

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.823 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I'd probably
find is artificial sweetener

00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:06.224 align:middle line:90%
in someone's kitchen.

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.494 align:middle line:84%
Splenda that they use in baking
or whatever they're putting

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:12.130 align:middle line:84%
in their coffee that they
think is low fat and,

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.365 align:middle line:90%
you know, no calories.

00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:14.933 align:middle line:90%
I would clear that out ASAP.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:15.433 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:16.501 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:17.669 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I would clear
out any diet sodas.

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:21.539 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Most people
have diet soda, right,

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:24.442 align:middle line:84%
because they think it's
going to make them slim.

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Uh huh.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.144 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Not true.

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:27.746 align:middle line:84%
I would throw out that,
and I would throw out --

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.448 align:middle line:84%
this might surprise you
-- everything wheat bread.

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:33.651 align:middle line:84%
I think we think that
wheat bread is healthy.

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.619 align:middle line:90%
I would throw that out.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You mean wheat,
whole wheat,

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.988 align:middle line:90%
grain, whole grain bread...

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:38.356 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Like whole wheat bread.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.925 align:middle line:84%
Throw that out and
anything white, of course.

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of course.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.262 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's something
that people might not know.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.731 align:middle line:84%
So, why would you throw out
the wheat and the white bread?

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:47.932 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Well.

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:50.402 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So, I think most of
us know that white bread

00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:54.506 align:middle line:84%
and white flours and maybe white
rice -- they're higher glycogens

00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:56.608 align:middle line:90%
and they spike their blood sugar

00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:58.676 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately
turns into body fat.

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:00.812 align:middle line:84%
Okay. You couldn't --
it's not healthy for you.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.048 align:middle line:84%
It's inflammatory
in your organs.

00:33:03.048 --> 00:33:05.417 align:middle line:84%
But wheat bread as well --
it's not the same wheat bread

00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:06.851 align:middle line:90%
that our great-grandmas made.

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:10.855 align:middle line:84%
It's not that fine corn wheat
that they had in ancient times.

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.791 align:middle line:84%
It's been altered
chemically to make...

00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:14.059 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: More, and more,
and more wheat...

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:15.794 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: We actually want to
know about breads, right?

00:33:15.794 --> 00:33:18.329 align:middle line:84%
So, they altered it to
make mass production

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:21.466 align:middle line:84%
and that is linking
people to obesity

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:24.736 align:middle line:84%
and to inflammation
and arthritis.

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:84%
All these hosted
diseases are coming

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
from the wheat that
we're consuming.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.574 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.909 align:middle line:90%
So, get rid of those things.

00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:33.244 align:middle line:84%
What about condiments and
salad dressings and so forth?

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:35.814 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
making your own?

00:33:35.814 --> 00:33:37.048 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: If you can.

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.584 align:middle line:84%
I know ketchup -- let's
talk about ketchup

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.386 align:middle line:90%
because people love ketchup.

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.189 align:middle line:84%
Those who like ketchup,
like ketchup and they put it

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:45.857 align:middle line:90%
on everything and that's --

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.859 align:middle line:84%
when I go to people's houses
ketchup's the one thing they're

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.027 align:middle line:90%
like, no.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:53.665 align:middle line:84%
You can have your
ketchup, but try to choose,

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:55.033 align:middle line:90%
you know, that balance.

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:57.469 align:middle line:84%
Do a little bit of ketchup, but
choose a ketchup that's made

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:01.706 align:middle line:84%
with no high fructose corn
syrup, and one maybe with Stevia

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.341 align:middle line:90%
or natural sweetener like honey.

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:05.176 align:middle line:84%
I know people are like,
honey in my ketchup?

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.412 align:middle line:84%
But, you can find those
natural sweeteners in ketchup...

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:07.945 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.012 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:34:09.012 --> 00:34:10.648 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, the more
organic ketchups.

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:11.749 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:12.983 align:middle line:84%
But not just organic
-- look for the sugars.

00:34:12.983 --> 00:34:15.353 align:middle line:84%
What is in -- what's making
up that organic ketchup?

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:17.956 align:middle line:84%
Because someone can slap an
organic label on and it's loaded

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:18.990 align:middle line:90%
with the wrong sugars.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.523 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh.

00:34:19.523 --> 00:34:20.492 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:34:20.492 --> 00:34:22.026 align:middle line:84%
Okay, good to look
at -- look for.

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:22.659 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.795 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: All right.

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.329 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at one
of Danette's suggestions

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
for healthy chocolate
chip cookies.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.266 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.367 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: [Background Music] Hi.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.103 align:middle line:84%
I'm Danette May and
welcome to my kitchen.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:33.805 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to
share with you one

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:37.075 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite recipes
that's loaded with protein,

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:39.344 align:middle line:84%
super healthy for
you and super quick.

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:41.279 align:middle line:84%
It is chocolate chip
cookie dough.

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:43.447 align:middle line:90%
Sounds delicious, doesn't it?

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:44.648 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:47.117 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is take
about three-fourths cup

00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:49.119 align:middle line:90%
of plain Greek yogurt.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:52.123 align:middle line:84%
Greek yogurt is a wonderful
protein source and it's loaded

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:84%
with probiotics which
helps with inflammation

00:34:54.159 --> 00:35:02.333 align:middle line:84%
in your gut ultimately leading
you to a flatter stomach.

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going
to have a tablespoon

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.846 align:middle line:84%
of almond butter another
wonderful protein source

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:19.817 align:middle line:84%
and a wonderful fat that
you can have in your diet.

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:22.921 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
one teaspoon of vanilla

00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and a hand full -- you can
see about how much I have,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.724 align:middle line:84%
handful of dark cocoa
nibs, chocolate chips

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:27.926 align:middle line:90%
that are 70% higher in cacao.

00:35:27.926 --> 00:35:29.127 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to take
one teaspoon of Stevia.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.495 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural
sweetener that I like to use,

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:31.696 align:middle line:84%
and so you're going to take
all these and mix it together

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.730 align:middle line:84%
in the bowl with the
yogurt, your vanilla,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.132 align:middle line:90%
and your chocolate chips --

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:39.003 align:middle line:84%
mix it together and now you have
a delicious tasting chocolate

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:41.339 align:middle line:90%
chip cookie dough recipe.

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:46.978 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:50.114 align:middle line:84%
So, are you a big fan of greens
and a green shake movement --

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:52.317 align:middle line:84%
all that of the green
juicing movement?

00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:53.384 align:middle line:90%
Did you get into that, as well?

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.919 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.622 align:middle line:84%
I think that one of
the missing links

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.958 align:middle line:84%
to our health is not
getting enough greens.

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:03.995 align:middle line:84%
So, I do love the movement but I
don't encourage anything extreme

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.197 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what gets
people off track is being

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:06.898 align:middle line:90%
too extreme.

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:08.266 align:middle line:90%
So, there's some people

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.635 align:middle line:84%
that that's all they're doing
is green juice all day long

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.804 align:middle line:84%
and that's not sustainable
or healthy as well,

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:14.305 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
getting enough calories --

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:15.974 align:middle line:90%
all the different combinations.

00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe in having
greens with every meal...

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.711 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You do?

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:20.245 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:21.079 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:22.347 align:middle line:90%
A small portion in every meal.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.015 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can take a break
off one because I eat five

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.683 align:middle line:84%
to six times a day
and I encourage people

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.285 align:middle line:90%
to eat five to six times a day.

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:30.521 align:middle line:84%
Let your body trust you
and fuel it for energy.

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:33.791 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So does the five to six
times a day set your metabolism

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.592 align:middle line:90%
up in a different way?

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of that?

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, the purpose is
-- is yeah, like I always say,

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.332 align:middle line:84%
your metabolism is
like this fire.

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:43.134 align:middle line:84%
Okay, you've got this
slow burning fire.

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:84%
If you don't eat, you're
putting the fire out.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.904 align:middle line:90%
It's starved.

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:49.507 align:middle line:84%
If you are overeating you're
putting the wrong things --

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:52.443 align:middle line:84%
it's like this blazing
mass, right?

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:55.146 align:middle line:84%
So, you want to just keep
this little fire going

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.547 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I do --

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:84%
about every two through three
hours I put some protein on it,

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.186 align:middle line:84%
I put some vegetable on it
and it trusts you, right?

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.822 align:middle line:84%
You start to have energy
and then you feed it again,

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.691 align:middle line:84%
and you feed it again,
so you never, like,

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:84%
dip low in your blood
sugar levels...

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.495 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's a great
way of explaining it --

00:37:10.495 --> 00:37:11.596 align:middle line:90%
you're feeding the fire.

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.697 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Your feeding the fire...

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:14.465 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so developing
a trust relationship

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:15.433 align:middle line:90%
with your metabolism.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:16.567 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.403 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And, so starving
and going without food

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:21.906 align:middle line:84%
for long periods of time
is teaching your metabolism

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.341 align:middle line:90%
to not burn.

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.575 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:27.211 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. You're actually
going to hold on to weight.

00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, how long do
you go between meals?

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.816 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: About every
two to three hours.

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.084 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:35.119 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing -- and you
learn to just keep that up

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
and keep that going...

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.654 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:37.722 align:middle line:90%
It becomes habit.

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.523 align:middle line:84%
It's like anything
at first something...

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.123 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Your body wants it...

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.491 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.626 align:middle line:84%
At first something might seem
a little different for you,

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.027 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
eating two times

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.796 align:middle line:84%
or maybe three times
a day you might be

00:37:44.796 --> 00:37:47.098 align:middle line:84%
like this a little different
for me and it seems hard

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.167 align:middle line:84%
at first just like
anything in life, right?

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:51.002 align:middle line:84%
What we're learning
is that it gets easier

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:84%
and then you just --
like second nature.

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:54.272 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Do you sometimes
find yourself eating

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.606 align:middle line:90%
when you're not hungry?

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:56.507 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.041 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Really?

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:57.675 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.577 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's counter-intuitive
but you do it

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:90%
because you're creating...

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:01.746 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Sometimes
-- I don't overeat.

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.114 align:middle line:90%
I don't -- but I go, you know,

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.917 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure my body needs
something and I always want

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
to keep that fire going
because a lot of what we eat

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.355 align:middle line:90%
or don't eat is emotional.

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:12.757 align:middle line:90%
We're really stressed out --

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:15.126 align:middle line:84%
some of us overeat and
some of us don't eat.

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.395 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So you're giving
your metabolism structure.

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:20.164 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I'm giving it love,
you know, I'm really trying

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:24.168 align:middle line:84%
to love it to trust me -- and I
know like, if that your gas --

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:27.605 align:middle line:84%
if you have a car -- you're
going to put gas in your car.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:28.172 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.107 align:middle line:90%
Right. Exactly.

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:30.308 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Take care
of your body too.

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.409 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:32.744 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about super foods

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and how super foods can help
us, not only to burn fat --

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.149 align:middle line:84%
but what are some of
the super foods you use?

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.517 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Okay.

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.486 align:middle line:84%
My favorite top three that you
can get at the grocery store

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.489 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
understated that are cheap --

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.124 align:middle line:90%
you can get them today --

00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:49.961 align:middle line:84%
is cayenne pepper,
turmeric, and lemons.

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.495 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Turmeric ...

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.329 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yes.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:53.264 align:middle line:90%
However you want to state it.

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.899 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a yellow spice.

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.801 align:middle line:90%
It's in curries, curry spice.

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.169 align:middle line:90%
But you can get it plain.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.672 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the leading
anti-inflammatory spices

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.807 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.142 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't find
anything that's going

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to decrease inflammation in
your body better than that.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.311 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What do you
do with the turmeric?

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:08.946 align:middle line:84%
Do you cook it or do
you whip it, or what?

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.214 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You can.

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:13.684 align:middle line:84%
You can find recipes that
provide turmeric in it --

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.653 align:middle line:84%
I like putting it in
my eggs in the morning

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.889 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
super, super strong.

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:20.591 align:middle line:84%
I put about a teaspoon in
my eggs, but how I love

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.860 align:middle line:84%
to take it just so I
know I'm getting it --

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.995 align:middle line:90%
I look at it like a concoction.

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:26.998 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning I used
to just do lemon water.

00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:29.967 align:middle line:84%
Now I do my lemon water, I put
a teaspoon of turmeric in it,

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:32.103 align:middle line:84%
and I do a pinch of
cayenne in there.

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.305 align:middle line:84%
So then I know -- and if
I need a little sweet,

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.841 align:middle line:84%
usually at night I like to
add a little bit of honey...

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:37.642 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, that's interesting.

00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:38.576 align:middle line:90%
So you do it at night?

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I do it morning
and night.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.613 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that fuels
the metabolism again,

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:43.648 align:middle line:90%
right, I could see that.

00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:45.049 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.018 align:middle line:84%
The cayenne, like, brings up the
oxygen consumption in your body.

00:39:47.018 --> 00:39:49.887 align:middle line:84%
Within 20 minutes of
consuming cayenne your

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.055 align:middle line:90%
metabolism increases.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:53.257 align:middle line:84%
It's a little fire,
a little engager.

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:56.194 align:middle line:84%
And the turmeric is helping
with inflammation, so, you know,

00:39:56.194 --> 00:40:00.098 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are walking
around with distended abdomens,

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:01.532 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
really overweight --

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:90%
because they're inflamed.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.703 align:middle line:84%
They're building up toxins
for all the wrong things,

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.538 align:middle line:84%
so turmeric is going
to help with that

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:10.741 align:middle line:84%
and the lemon's going
to help with that.

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.244 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Another place that
shows up a lot is the arms

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.946 align:middle line:90%
and that drives me nuts.

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:17.748 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
Danette's recipe for the arms

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:18.783 align:middle line:90%
but it's really an exercise.

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.952 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:21.586 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: [Background Music] Hi.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:22.553 align:middle line:90%
Danette May here.

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.589 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
so embarrassed

00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:26.757 align:middle line:90%
by your flab under your arm?

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Those dreaded chicken wings
that flap in the wind?

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.497 align:middle line:84%
And you hate push-ups
at the same time?

00:40:32.497 --> 00:40:35.132 align:middle line:84%
Today I want to show you
exercise movements you can do

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:37.268 align:middle line:84%
to tone up the whole
section of your arm

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.003 align:middle line:90%
without doing a single push up.

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.172 align:middle line:84%
You cannot believe how
great this movement is.

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.975 align:middle line:84%
I learned it from the beautiful
[inaudible] and you will see

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:47.378 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, doing this with
me how this is really going

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.579 align:middle line:90%
to tone up your arm.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.681 align:middle line:84%
First off, you're going to
just take your arms out.

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:52.583 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
circles forward.

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.019 align:middle line:84%
You're going to circle
forward for 30 seconds.

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:57.855 align:middle line:84%
I know this seems like, how
can this really affect me?

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.657 align:middle line:84%
If you do this you
will find out.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:02.693 align:middle line:84%
After that 30 seconds,
you're going to go backwards.

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:05.763 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Opposite direction
for 30 seconds.

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:09.133 align:middle line:84%
Your arms are going to feel
hot at this point, okay?

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.302 align:middle line:84%
Once you've hit 30
seconds going back,

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:13.538 align:middle line:84%
bring your hands
up to a goal post.

00:41:13.538 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to reach
up and then pretend

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.241 align:middle line:84%
like you're pulling
something down.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:21.112 align:middle line:84%
You can see that my biceps have
started to engage, then reach

00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:22.647 align:middle line:90%
and just go that goal post.

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:24.849 align:middle line:90%
Down. Up. And down.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:25.917 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.486 align:middle line:84%
Up and down -- doing
this for 30 seconds.

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.688 align:middle line:84%
After you've done this,
now they're really

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.623 align:middle line:90%
on fire, but hang with me.

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:38.162 align:middle line:84%
Stay here with your goal posts,
then come forward out, and in.

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.131 align:middle line:90%
This is starting work.

00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:42.133 align:middle line:90%
Now your pectorals muscle.

00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:44.502 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
this for 30 seconds.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:47.805 align:middle line:84%
Yes. As you're doing this
forward and back motion,

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:50.942 align:middle line:84%
you're also getting the
back part of your back.

00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:53.144 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to turn
around so you can see.

00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm squeezing and
going forward and back.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.248 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just doing the motion,

00:41:57.248 --> 00:42:02.453 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really pushing
back and front.

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:04.288 align:middle line:90%
So, I am actually flexing.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:08.526 align:middle line:84%
You can see my bicep right her
is engaged going front and back.

00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:84%
At this point after 30 seconds
bring everything together.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:90%
My elbows stay together.

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:16.167 align:middle line:90%
That is key.

00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:17.702 align:middle line:90%
Hands are right here.

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:20.071 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lift and lower.

00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:22.139 align:middle line:90%
Try to get your elbows up to

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:25.109 align:middle line:84%
at least your jaw line
keeping your elbows together.

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:29.914 align:middle line:84%
I haven't even done the full 30
seconds and I'm feeling this.

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:34.385 align:middle line:84%
You can do this workout
anywhere at any time

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:37.622 align:middle line:84%
and truly see benefits
in your arms.

00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:38.656 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I can see you
were out of breath.

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I was too.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.359 align:middle line:90%
I tried that.

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:43.561 align:middle line:84%
I'm encouraging you guys to
do these videos along with us.

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I tried that when I
was sitting at my desk

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.264 align:middle line:90%
and that really burns.

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You know, it's deceiving
because you're thinking --

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.136 align:middle line:84%
you're not holding any weights,
it's just your arms extended.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.204 align:middle line:90%
How can this really work?

00:42:53.204 --> 00:42:54.372 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And I was out of breath.

00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:55.473 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:58.175 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You were too,
so I don't feel so bad.

00:42:58.175 --> 00:42:59.677 align:middle line:90%
It seems to work, I guess --

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
you can do a lot of these
things sitting at your desk.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:90%
You can do a lot --

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.983 align:middle line:84%
many exercises just
to get oxygen flowing

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.451 align:middle line:90%
in your body throughout the day.

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:08.252 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.587 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is really cool.

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.922 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Give me some of your
favorite recipes from the book.

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.924 align:middle line:84%
Dinners -- dinners are
always a challenge.

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:16.627 align:middle line:84%
Long day at work, you
get home, now what?

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:17.995 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You're just like me

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.331 align:middle line:84%
because dinners have always
been my challenge because I'm,

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.733 align:middle line:84%
kind of like done,
like thinking.

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:24.335 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to think any more.

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:25.469 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you have to
go to the market -- yeah.

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.438 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: So, I just want
something really simple.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.073 align:middle line:90%
I love pasta.

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:32.343 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big pasta fan, and
so what I found is a way

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.578 align:middle line:90%
to eat pasta that's gluten free.

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:37.448 align:middle line:84%
So what you do -- and you can
buy these even at Wal-Mart.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.784 align:middle line:84%
I've researched, so no
one has any excuse not

00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:41.552 align:middle line:90%
to eat brown rice noodles.

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.753 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh great.

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.655 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: They taste just the
same as regular noodles.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:45.756 align:middle line:90%
Your kids will not know.

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.158 align:middle line:90%
You will not know.

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So, you just cook them -- I take
those out and put a little bit

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.929 align:middle line:84%
of olive oil on it, some
pepper, some sea salt --

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.165 align:middle line:90%
chop up some tomatoes...

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.499 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...okay, and then you
can sprinkle a little feta.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.802 align:middle line:90%
Super simple, right?

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:00.237 align:middle line:84%
Not anything -- oh, and
I take fresh basil always

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:02.707 align:middle line:84%
from my basil plant
and put that on.

00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:03.974 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.042 align:middle line:90%
Super simple.

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.645 align:middle line:84%
And you're not sacrificing
anything, right,

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.013 align:middle line:90%
and you're eating delicious...

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.115 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you don't have salty
tomato sauces on the pasta.

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:14.051 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing fresh
tomatoes and feta.

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:16.787 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And you can use salted
vegetables if you wanted to

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.255 align:middle line:90%
and put that on there --

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:90%
but everything taste better

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.559 align:middle line:84%
with a little olive oil,
sea salt, and pepper.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:23.127 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And I also
understand olive oil is good

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:25.429 align:middle line:84%
for inflammation as well
as decrease inflammation.

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.164 align:middle line:90%
And that's good you said

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that because I think
people think, "Oh.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.769 align:middle line:84%
If I have fat I'm
going to get fat."

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:34.004 align:middle line:90%
No. You need fat to lose fat

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.706 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the right
fat which is olive oil.

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.475 align:middle line:90%
That was working.

00:44:37.475 --> 00:44:40.945 align:middle line:84%
We were sold the no fat,
low carb diet product

00:44:40.945 --> 00:44:43.914 align:middle line:90%
for a long time and it, kind of,

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.583 align:middle line:84%
wound up backfiring
in a little bit.

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Right.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.752 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So, all right.

00:44:47.752 --> 00:44:50.087 align:middle line:84%
So, back to what we were going
through with other recipes --

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is it better to eat
a larger meal

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.658 align:middle line:90%
for breakfast, lunch, or dinner?

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.195 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, actually
I think you should...

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Spread it out?

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.698 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Spread it out.

00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:02.166 align:middle line:90%
Eat five to six times a day

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:04.034 align:middle line:84%
and make them pretty
comparable sizes.

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:07.338 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I don't want to
overlook my fire in my stomach.

00:45:07.338 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If I were to eat a
bigger meal, say like, --

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.609 align:middle line:84%
because we can't always
control what we're eating.

00:45:11.609 --> 00:45:14.044 align:middle line:84%
We're going out to eat or
we're at friend's homes,

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:16.013 align:middle line:90%
or on vacation, what not --

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:19.183 align:middle line:84%
I would have breakfast as my
bigger meal or my lunchtime.

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:21.752 align:middle line:84%
Because then you have the day
to let your metabolism go.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.954 align:middle line:84%
You're not just like
stopping because usually

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:26.557 align:middle line:84%
at night we're sitting
and we're relaxing

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:84%
and your metabolism
naturally slows down at night.

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.562 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And do you ever to
fasting or cleansing days?

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:32.563 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:35.866 align:middle line:84%
I try to do about
one or two a year.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I try to do a cleanse during
the transitions of the seasons.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.706 align:middle line:84%
I have a wonderful
[inaudible] cleanse that I love,

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:45.276 align:middle line:84%
and it's all about
eating raw foods.

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:47.812 align:middle line:84%
I don't do any cleanses that
are just drinking cleanses.

00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:51.615 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in that,
other than maybe one time

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.517 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to
do like a two day.

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.753 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But it makes sense
based on the metabolism concept

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:58.556 align:middle line:84%
that you explained to us --
that you need to feed the body

00:45:58.556 --> 00:46:00.758 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways even
during cleanses.

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:01.725 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:02.726 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at three

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:04.228 align:middle line:84%
of the foods you
should never eat.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.362 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: [Background Music] Hi.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.631 align:middle line:90%
I'm Danette May.

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:10.201 align:middle line:84%
Today, I want to share with you
three foods that you're eating

00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:12.469 align:middle line:84%
that you think are healthy
and helping you lose weight,

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.705 align:middle line:84%
but actually are
making you fatter.

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:17.208 align:middle line:84%
Be sure to watch the whole video
because at the end I'm going

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:20.144 align:middle line:84%
to give you my number one
favorite fat burning recipe.

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Being a certified trainer
and nutrition coach

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.683 align:middle line:84%
for the past 13 years, I've
seen countless people try

00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:29.253 align:middle line:84%
to lose stubborn body fat by
eating so called healthy foods,

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or just eating a crazy diets,
or taking dangerous supplements.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
These three foods you've been
led to believe are healthy

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.129 align:middle line:84%
and will help you lose
weight, but I would avoid them.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:41.432 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
artificial sweeteners

00:46:41.432 --> 00:46:44.702 align:middle line:84%
such as Splenda they use
in baking, aspartame that's

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:47.705 align:middle line:84%
in Crystal Light and diet
sodas, and sucralose.

00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.974 align:middle line:84%
These items are loaded
with chemicals

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:52.643 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately alter
your hormone balance.

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.645 align:middle line:84%
When your hormones
are imbalanced,

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.748 align:middle line:84%
it creates stubborn body
fat that's hard to lose.

00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.016 align:middle line:90%
Choose natural sweeteners

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:01.752 align:middle line:84%
such as 100 % maple
syrup, stevia, and honey.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:08.092 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is 100 %
whole wheat breads and pastas,

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:10.561 align:middle line:84%
reduced fat whole
wheat crackers --

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.531 align:middle line:84%
these items are going to
spike your blood sugars.

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.567 align:middle line:84%
When you spike your blood
sugars, it converts right

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:20.371 align:middle line:84%
into fat and the idea of getting
rid of all complex carbs --

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:90%
that's not a good idea either.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.276 align:middle line:84%
Things like slow-cooked
oatmeal, rice,

00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:28.913 align:middle line:84%
and yams are actually loaded
with fiber, nutrients, vitamins

00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:31.815 align:middle line:84%
and minerals that will
help you lose weight.

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:35.419 align:middle line:84%
The third thing, light
or fat-free yogurt

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.987 align:middle line:90%
with fruit in the bottom.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.489 align:middle line:90%
Just because it says light

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:40.791 align:middle line:84%
or fat-free does
not mean it's going

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.694 align:middle line:90%
to make you light or fat free.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:47.464 align:middle line:84%
This item right here is loaded
with chemicals and sugar

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.900 align:middle line:90%
that convert right into fat.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.803 align:middle line:90%
Choose a plain Greek yogurt.

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:55.639 align:middle line:84%
Greek yogurt is loaded
with probiotics which helps

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:59.176 align:middle line:84%
with creating a healthy gut
and a slimmer waistline.

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:01.979 align:middle line:84%
I like to sweeten mine
with a little bit of honey

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:90%
or one teaspoon of stevia.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.351 align:middle line:84%
You can add nuts or fresh
fruit for a really yummy treat.

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:11.355 align:middle line:84%
I know this can be so confusing
and that is why I wrote my book,

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:13.457 align:middle line:84%
Eat, Drink, and
Shrink , I wanted to take

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:16.493 align:middle line:84%
out all the guess work, all
the complexity and give it

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:20.431 align:middle line:84%
to you straight on exactly
what, when, and how much to eat

00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:22.599 align:middle line:84%
for fast and lasting
weight loss.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.735 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to give
you my number one,

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.338 align:middle line:84%
favorite fat burning
recipe from this book.

00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:30.441 align:middle line:84%
I personally use this recipe
to strip off inches and pounds

00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:32.977 align:middle line:84%
after having three kids
to get ripped and toned

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:35.746 align:middle line:84%
for a recent bikini
competition with some

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.849 align:middle line:84%
of the top fitness
models in the world.

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:39.683 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Look at you.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.118 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy -- looking great.

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.252 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: It's awesome.

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.454 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:45.155 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
Danette's favorite recipes --

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.091 align:middle line:84%
Something super easy
first of all.

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:49.293 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to cook this
which is why we're doing it here

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.894 align:middle line:84%
in the studio which
is super great.

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.962 align:middle line:84%
All right, so what
do we got here?

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.297 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Okay, this is my --

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:56.233 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite go to fat
burning recipes because it's

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.401 align:middle line:90%
so quick -- I'm human.

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I have a sweet tooth...

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:00.437 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.271 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: ...and this
fixes my sweet tooth.

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.473 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay, good.

00:49:02.473 --> 00:49:03.741 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: So, first thing
you're going to do --

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:06.677 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take three
cups of slow cooked oats.

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:09.847 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
a gluten-free version too.

00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:11.548 align:middle line:90%
So, if you're not wanting oats,

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:14.585 align:middle line:84%
you can use almond mill
instead, or almond flour.

00:49:14.585 --> 00:49:15.986 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:18.389 align:middle line:84%
But those are gluten-free oats,
so there's that option in the...

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:18.922 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Oh yes.

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.957 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.558 align:middle line:84%
So, you're going to
put that in there

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:84%
which is a wonderful
carb source.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.295 align:middle line:84%
Okay. You're going
to take three scoops

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.164 align:middle line:90%
of chocolate whey protein.

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.967 align:middle line:84%
When you're choosing your
whey protein try to choose one

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:31.769 align:middle line:90%
with a natural sweetener in it.

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:32.836 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So, be careful.

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:34.638 align:middle line:84%
Not all whey proteins
are created equal.

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.707 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This particular one
has beet sugar in it...

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:37.207 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Ooh.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:37.841 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.009 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It's great.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:41.412 align:middle line:84%
Yeah -- I like it
because it's good.

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.948 align:middle line:84%
So these two things right now
will stabilize your blood sugar.

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:46.583 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Blood sugars, because
now you have your protein

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:47.518 align:middle line:90%
and you have your carb.

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:48.018 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:49.219 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:49.753 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you can do
this with your kids too...

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:50.454 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.488 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.656 align:middle line:84%
My kids think these
are their cookies.

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.291 align:middle line:90%
They love these.

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.026 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to take all natural --

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:58.562 align:middle line:84%
one cup of all natural
or almond butter,

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.397 align:middle line:84%
peanut butter almond
butter -- okay.

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:02.232 align:middle line:84%
And this is a wonderful
fat source.

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.901 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's not
going to make you fat.

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:08.172 align:middle line:84%
The right fat is actually
going to help your metabolism

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:09.273 align:middle line:90%
to burn more efficiently.

00:50:09.273 --> 00:50:11.008 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, this raw
peanut butter and stuff

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:15.913 align:middle line:84%
that you can get -- I've
always been sensitive

00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to the rancid oils
in peanut butters.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.685 align:middle line:90%
Now what's the difference here?

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.188 align:middle line:84%
How do you find the peanut
butters that are not rancid --

00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:84%
what is -- there
are sugary ones...

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.624 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:31.695 align:middle line:84%
You want to choose a raw --
just, there's no oils in it.

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:35.466 align:middle line:84%
Right. It's just ground up nuts
whether, almonds or peanuts.

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:37.734 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So the ones that separate
are not good, or they are good?

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:39.903 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, they are
because that's the natural oil

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:41.105 align:middle line:90%
in the peanut.

00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:43.273 align:middle line:84%
When they're not separated
they've actually used

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:46.276 align:middle line:84%
hydrogenated oils to keep
it mixed and stirred,

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.678 align:middle line:84%
so you do not want
to choose that kind.

00:50:47.678 --> 00:50:49.046 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:51.081 align:middle line:84%
So, only use the kind that has
the separated oil on top...

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.883 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Or, you can go into
the store and actually --

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:55.719 align:middle line:84%
some of them have you can grind
them right then and there.

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.554 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. You can do that, as well.

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:58.522 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you can
make your own.

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:00.023 align:middle line:84%
You can, maybe, grind
it yourself

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:02.793 align:middle line:84%
but make sure you get
the kind that's raw.

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:06.296 align:middle line:84%
And, does it have to be maybe in
the dark glass or does it have

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.464 align:middle line:90%
to have a short shelf life --

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.433 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what kind of
peanut butter do you use?

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, I choose ones
that say raw and I put it

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.406 align:middle line:84%
in the fridge because
that can turn rancid,

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:19.476 align:middle line:84%
but still you're fine
and once you've open it,

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:20.511 align:middle line:90%
put it in the fridge.

00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:22.012 align:middle line:84%
Anything you have
that has fat in it,

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:24.748 align:middle line:84%
you should probably
keep it in a cool place.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.183 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well then what do
you do when it solidifies?

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: I stir it.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.785 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean, like...

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:31.488 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: The fat and the oils
while it's in the fridge?

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:32.456 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: You can either dump it

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.358 align:middle line:84%
out if you don't
want those oils.

00:51:34.358 --> 00:51:38.095 align:middle line:84%
I like the oil, personally, and
I just stir it in every time.

00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:38.662 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Good idea.

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:39.596 align:middle line:90%
Okay. All right.

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.597 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: And then you're going

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.799 align:middle line:84%
to take one-fourth
of natural honey.

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:45.269 align:middle line:84%
Okay? This gives it a
little bit of sweetness

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:47.838 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't want as much
sweetness you can totally get

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.506 align:middle line:84%
away with it and
still love these.

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.909 align:middle line:90%
You can do less honey.

00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:52.943 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.344 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you can
do [inaudible] honey

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.114 align:middle line:84%
because it actually have a --
not a pro -- but a super food.

00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:57.681 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:58.549 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:01.051 align:middle line:90%
And then you're going to do...

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.452 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Water's over there...

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:05.289 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: One-third of water.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:07.024 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, can
start a little less.

00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:08.091 align:middle line:90%
This is where we kind of talk

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.927 align:middle line:84%
about sometimes they
can get too moist --

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:11.128 align:middle line:90%
so just kind of gauge it.

00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:14.164 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just going
to mix it all together.

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:16.066 align:middle line:84%
And then once it's all
mixed together, you're going

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.634 align:middle line:84%
to roll them into
one inch balls,

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:21.805 align:middle line:84%
and we see right here I have
some with almond mill in them

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and these ones have
oats in them,

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.642 align:middle line:84%
and if you want a
little extra texture,

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:29.179 align:middle line:84%
on these ones I've added
dark chocolate chips 70 %

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:84%
or higher cocoa and these
with walnuts, raw walnuts.

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:33.784 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ooh, nice.

00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:35.085 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: It's like a cookie dough.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:37.287 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I made these last
night with my daughter

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:40.724 align:middle line:84%
which was really fun, but they
didn't look as good as yours.

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.126 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Well, its okay and
the reason we're sitting here

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:46.096 align:middle line:84%
in the studio -- and so,
my favorite thing to do

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:48.232 align:middle line:84%
with them is put
them in the freezer.

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:49.833 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to wrap
them individually.

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.468 align:middle line:84%
I just stick them in the
container and put them

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:54.304 align:middle line:84%
in the freezer and they're a
quick, easy on-the-go snack.

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Kids love them -- they
almost taste a little better.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.841 align:middle line:90%
It's fun to eat them that way.

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.177 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: They're great for
kid's lunch boxes as well.

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.612 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:06.049 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You can add things
like almonds or walnuts,

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.251 align:middle line:90%
probably walnuts are better.

00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:09.853 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I do unsweetened,
shredded coconut in there

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.255 align:middle line:90%
if you want a little Hawaiian.

00:53:11.255 --> 00:53:14.224 align:middle line:84%
Some macadamia nuts -- you can
do a lot of different things.

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:15.559 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.494 align:middle line:84%
Nice. Do you have -- when
you're cooking for the holidays,

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:20.664 align:middle line:84%
do you ever have big
meals during the holidays?

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.833 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever have time where
it's just not possible

00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:24.434 align:middle line:90%
to have the six meals a day?

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:25.669 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:28.739 align:middle line:84%
You got to be, like I
said, loving to yourself --

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:32.376 align:middle line:84%
my best friend would say,
Danette is so strict I'm sure,

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:35.245 align:middle line:84%
Danette -- and she
was like, "No.

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.281 align:middle line:84%
Actually she -- I
love carrot cake.

00:53:37.281 --> 00:53:38.348 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:39.383 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay, okay.

00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:40.384 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: If someone
is going to offer me

00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:41.685 align:middle line:90%
that I have a carrot cake.

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.754 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy it and I don't
feel guilty about it.

00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:44.388 align:middle line:90%
I don't...

00:53:44.388 --> 00:53:45.155 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You don't?

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:46.223 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: ...stress about it

00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.157 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not eating
carrot cake every day

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:48.558 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not eating
it every week.

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:51.862 align:middle line:84%
But I do enjoy -- and there are
times you can't control things.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:53.497 align:middle line:90%
But that's okay.

00:53:53.497 --> 00:53:55.065 align:middle line:90%
Just conquer your own kitchen.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.466 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you don't
make up for the day --

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.468 align:middle line:90%
say you had carrot cake at night

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.704 align:middle line:84%
and the next day you
don't skip a meal.

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:01.772 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Absolutely not.

00:54:01.772 --> 00:54:03.073 align:middle line:90%
But I will move.

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I do know intuitively --
okay, I just ate carrot cake

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.245 align:middle line:84%
and that had a lot
of sugar in it.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.746 align:middle line:84%
My body doesn't really
want sugar.

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.481 align:middle line:90%
None of our bodies want sugar.

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:15.085 align:middle line:84%
So, I will try to go for a
walk after that meal, you know.

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.687 align:middle line:84%
If I'm with family I'll
be like, "Hey guys.

00:54:16.687 --> 00:54:18.622 align:middle line:84%
You want to go for a
little night walk?"

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:90%
"Go look at the moon?"

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.592 align:middle line:84%
I try to bring in movement in
there because I want to get

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:25.829 align:middle line:84%
that body going to burn
up the sugars instead

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of letting them convert
right into fat

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.498 align:middle line:90%
and sit in my bloodstream.

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.133 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, you live in
an area that has a lot

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:32.035 align:middle line:90%
of snow -- you're in Utah.

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:34.838 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do when
there's nowhere to go outside

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:35.939 align:middle line:90%
or if it's snowing or something?

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.808 align:middle line:90%
Do you do indoor exercises also?

00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:39.142 align:middle line:90%
Other than skiing...

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:41.678 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, you know, and
what I have this philosophy --

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:44.815 align:middle line:84%
and I make my kids do it --
every day you go outside.

00:54:44.815 --> 00:54:47.484 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if it's raining,
snowing, we're not going

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.188 align:middle line:84%
to melt -- get your coat on,
because nature is a healer.

00:54:51.188 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:84%
And you're really going to
receive a lot of inspiration

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:57.361 align:middle line:84%
and stay on point with healthy
eating and exercising just

00:54:57.361 --> 00:54:58.795 align:middle line:90%
by getting out in nature.

00:54:58.795 --> 00:54:59.863 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel better,

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:02.065 align:middle line:84%
so put on your clothes
and go for a walk.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:04.801 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's been interesting,
because within the first 10

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.904 align:middle line:84%
to 15 minutes of exercise
the endorphins release.

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.773 align:middle line:84%
The happy chemicals
start to flow

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.475 align:middle line:90%
in your brain and in your body.

00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:14.444 align:middle line:84%
It will completely shift
my mood within 15 minutes.

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.645 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.047 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I can actually
feel the shift happening.

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:20.083 align:middle line:84%
I can feel negativity,
or whatever it is

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that I've got going with my
day -- up until that workout,

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:26.556 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes in I'm in a
completely different mood.

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:27.758 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: It's powerful.

00:55:27.758 --> 00:55:29.059 align:middle line:90%
It is power.

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.361 align:middle line:84%
And the thing to remember is
we don't have to exercise.

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.063 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to eat well.

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.364 align:middle line:90%
We get to.

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:36.933 align:middle line:84%
It's our choice and once you
say, "This is my choice."

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:39.436 align:middle line:84%
All that other drama
goes out the door.

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:42.305 align:middle line:84%
Trying to overthink it or
when am I going to get it

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.774 align:middle line:90%
in -- I get to do this.

00:55:43.774 --> 00:55:49.613 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's a great point --
but I loved it when you said,

00:55:49.613 --> 00:55:51.882 align:middle line:84%
"Abs, good abs are
made in the kitchen."

00:55:51.882 --> 00:55:53.683 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: It's true.

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.585 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's perfect
because it's true.

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.387 align:middle line:84%
All the inflammation
around our guts

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.389 align:middle line:84%
and so forth you can get
rid of with the foods

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.491 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating -- the
cleansing food and the drink

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:02.893 align:middle line:90%
that you made as well.

00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:04.161 align:middle line:84%
And you do that twice
a day, right?

00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:05.228 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, do you
ever do protein shakes,

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.365 align:middle line:84%
different types of
protein powders?

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:11.268 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
anything, whey, not whey?

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:14.037 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: I definitely don't do
soy and I have a whole section

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:17.274 align:middle line:84%
in my book about why
I don't choose soy.

00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:19.776 align:middle line:84%
So I choose a whey
protein and I do protein.

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:22.512 align:middle line:84%
I don't always to
a protein shake,

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:25.315 align:middle line:84%
but it is a really great
option if you're on the go.

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.716 align:middle line:90%
It's so much better

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:30.520 align:middle line:84%
than choosing the alternatives
sometimes because -- there is --

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.590 align:middle line:84%
you know once again, I want a
protein if I don't have time

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.792 align:middle line:84%
to have something that takes
a little longer then a protein

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:90%
shake is a great source.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.128 align:middle line:90%
You can throw fruit in there.

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:41.331 align:middle line:84%
I love throwing chia in
there which is wonderful --

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:43.233 align:middle line:84%
and so, vegetables
too you can throw them

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.134 align:middle line:90%
and mask them in there.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:45.435 align:middle line:90%
I do spinach in every smoothie.

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:46.136 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh.

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a great idea .

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:47.637 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: And you never taste it.

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:49.005 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's right.

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:52.609 align:middle line:84%

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.715 align:middle line:90%
Keep going, girl.

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.116 align:middle line:90%
