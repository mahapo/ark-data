00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And we are broadcasting
from Denver, Colorado,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:84%
with my guest, shamanic healer
Dr. Alberto Villoldo, who's

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:90%
also a medical anthropologist.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
We started part
one, and now this

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is part two of the
interview, because we

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
were talking with so much
detail about shamanic medicine

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and your book "One
Spirit Medicine."

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to continue
the conversation

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
about the luminous
body and hacking

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:90%
THE biofield of the body.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.582 align:middle line:90%
What is that, specifically?

00:00:42.582 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. ALBERTO VILLOLDO:
You know, hacking

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:90%
is big business these days.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.694 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And
it's certainly not

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:90%
in the lexicon of the shamans.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about hacking,
but they talk about upgrading.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But in effect, the biofield
is our luminous energy field.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.537 align:middle line:84%
And when we're born, it comes
pre-loaded with software.

00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:01.995 align:middle line:84%
I just bought a
new Apple Computer,

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and it came pre-loaded
with software.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Our biofield also comes
pre-loaded with software,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's a the software
for the species,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.716 align:middle line:90%
for the survival of the species.

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And we all have this.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: And we all have.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But, see, nature's interested
in the longevity of the species,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
but not of the
individual so that it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
ensures the longevity
of the species

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
by programming us
for reproduction.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.567 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we're so obsessed
with sex all of our lives.

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So you want
to upgrade, to really hack

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
the biofield so you can
program for the longevity

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rather than the species?

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: See, the
longevity of the individual

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is not of any benefit
to the species.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.201 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
because if you have

00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of long-lived
old mammoths, then

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
benefit the species.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It wants the young,
the vibrant--

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Reproductive.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Your
reproductive years.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And then what nature does is
begins to shut certain systems

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:90%
down, like your hormones.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.985 align:middle line:90%
We know the changes.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:84%
The growth hormone systems,
they begin to shut down.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The detoxification
systems inside the cell,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
mitochondrial repair
systems, after the age of 40

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
because you're no longer
of interest to the species

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.821 align:middle line:90%
for survival.

00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So these
systems begin to shut down.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So the shamans discovered
how to hack the biofield.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Reprogram the
biofield for longevity.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.456 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: How do you
switch these systems on

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
again that, for example,
we have longevity genes,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that are called
the sirtuin genes,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:90%
inside every cell in our body.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
But they're silenced.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So how do you activate
the longevity genes,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
because nature selects
for reproduction,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
but it also selects
for intelligence.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.065 align:middle line:84%
It prefers intelligence to teeth
and to brawn and to muscle.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So keeping
the brain active.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: No, so the key
is that the most intelligent

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
members of the species were
able to hack the biofield

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to increase their
longevity by switching

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
on the longevity genes.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the most
intelligent doesn't mean

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the people that are smartest
or make the most money,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.445 align:middle line:84%
but the people that have access
to what we call the spiritual.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you do this from the
luminous body, or do you--

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: From
the luminous body.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.418 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do it from there.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can reprogram the
longevity of the individual

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.772 align:middle line:90%
through the luminous body.

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.525 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that is
and how you do that.

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
the way that it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
works at the level
of the body is

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that you want to switch
on the longevity genes,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:90%
the longevity proteins.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're called the
sirtuin genes, SIRT1 and 2.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And they are in every
cell in the body.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Now, the
beauty of these genes

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is that they switch on
the antioxidant systems

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
inside every cell,
and they switch

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
on the detox pathways
inside every cell

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
so that you're able
to eliminate waste.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
You switch on the genes
that create health

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and the genes that
give you long life.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do this
through visualization?

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, OK.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Not unless you've
prepared your brain first.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
But let me tell you a story.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Amazon
jungle one time,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and I asked an old
man, how do you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:90%
avoid the illnesses of old age?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
if you want to avoid

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the illnesses of
old age, you simply

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
live a long and healthy life.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wait, wait a minute.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You didn't understand
the question.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, I understood
the question.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to avoid the
illnesses of old age,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:90%
live a long and healthy life.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And what he was
saying is that if you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
can switch on the
longevity genes,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
they'll protect you against
the illnesses of old age.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.572 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so how do you
switch on the longevity genes?

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: We know
a lot about how

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
you do that biologically,
the foods that do that,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
like broccoli seed
is one up them.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Curcumin is another one.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Detoxifiers are another.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
The caloric restriction, when
you reduce your caloric intake,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
or fasting, will also switch
on the longevity genes.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.546 align:middle line:84%
You talk a lot about
fasting in your book.

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: That's
why fasting is

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
in every culture in the world.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Explain the
benefits of fasting.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.455 align:middle line:90%
Explain that, and for how long.

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's really interesting.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
It turns on certain genes.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.691 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, it turns
on the longevity gene.

00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about the biological.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.058 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
get to the energetic.

00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But fasting, you
find that in Christianity,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:90%
lent, and Judaism, Yom Kippur.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
In Islam it's Ramadan, and
yoga, and every tradition

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Because our ancestors,
out paleolithic ancestors,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
used to feast and then
fast, because they had

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:90%
no refrigeration, basically.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.265 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You ate what
you caught that day,

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and then it might be
another three or four days.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.926 align:middle line:90%
There's no leftovers.

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: There's
no leftovers.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't last.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So we
would feast and fast.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we fasted, the
body would go into repair.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've been eating three
meals a day since we were born.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
how to get the body

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to go into the
repair mode, which

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:90%
is what happens when you fast.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when you break
fast, when your breakfast,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not having
enough time to recycle.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.711 align:middle line:84%
So the ideal fasting
is 18 hours a day.

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And you're
fasting not from all foods

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:90%
but only from sugars.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you do
juices, green juices?

00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So,
what you do is you

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have any
sugars after 6:00,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.835 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have any sugars
before noon the next day.

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So you don't
eat any fruit for breakfast.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't eat bread.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
You can have breakfast
at 7:00 in the morning,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:90%
but you eat proteins and fats.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Eat a piece of salmon,
an avocado, some nuts.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't eat three
pieces of toast

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
because that turns
on the sugar system.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You can keep that
18 hour sugar free.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a glass of
wine at 10 o'clock at night.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.282 align:middle line:84%
You have it at 2:00
in the afternoon.

00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, that's
about right now.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Because
it's full of sugar.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a
fast from sugars.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From 6:00 to 6:00.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And you do it
from 6:00 in the evening

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
until noon the next day.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, till noon, OK.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So the following
morning at 7:00 in the morning,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.745 align:middle line:84%
you have fats and proteins
for breakfast, eggs, avocado.

00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But you don't turn
on the sugar system.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
That keeps the
recycling mode active.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And that switches on
the longevity genes.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You can also do a
longer fast, a three or five.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But the maximum benefit is
from this 18 hour daily fast.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a great daily practice.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.695 align:middle line:84%
But should you kick start
it with a longer two-day--

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't need to.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's dangerous to kick
start it with a longer fast,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
because you'll
begin to detoxify.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But if your liver is
toxic, if you've not

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
cleansed the liver first,
you'll recycle those toxins.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
very interesting.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So, I've done cleanses
before, and the first day

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
is always the hardest
because that's when the most

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:90%
detoxification is happening.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.948 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:08:44.948 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So before you detox, you
need to cleanse the liver.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
toxins are stored

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
in the long-lived
molecules in the body,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and these are fat cells.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:90%
So toxins are stored in fat.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
When you go in a
fast very suddenly

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
without clearing the elimination
organs like the liver,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
these toxins will get recycled.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And remember the
brain is 75% fat.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So you're taking
toxins that might

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
have been stored in
belly fat, and now you're

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:90%
storing them in the brain.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which explains why
the epidemic of obesity leads

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:90%
to the epidemic of Alzheimer's.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So, I love how you take this
practical ancient wisdom

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to a
level of something

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can do in
modern society,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and you really combine the
two in such a pragmatic way.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk more about
the luminous energy field.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that
that's not a quick fix.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not a matter of 18 hours.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.992 align:middle line:84%
Your luminous energy field
has changed and reprogrammed.

00:09:48.992 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.116 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
it that you teach,

00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and how long do people
go through the programs

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have to really change
those cellular memories--

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk about
those as well-- to change

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
the emotions and the feelings?

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, our
training is a 30-day program.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.996 align:middle line:90%
It's a 300-hour training.

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of clearing
your energy field,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
you can clear a lot of
imprints in the field.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But remembered that it
comes with a caveat.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You can not clear a traumatic
or an emotional imprint

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
from the field until
you learn the lessons

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:90%
that you need to learn.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So somebody cannot
come and take it away.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
The shaman has to help
you learn the lesson,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to keep
repeating the grade.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can't
just get over it.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You cannot
have somebody just--

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take it out.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.476 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: --take him away.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But say, what is it
that you need to learn?

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've
met people that say,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.587 align:middle line:90%
my cancer saved my life.

00:10:49.587 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard someone say?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yes.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Amazing.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: They got the gifts,
and they got the lessons.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was
the greatest gift.

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the lessons.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And those lessons,
just learning that,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
what does that do
to the biofield?

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
When you open up
that learning, when

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you get that epiphany
of that tragic thing

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
happen in your life so
that you could X, Y, Z,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
do what you do now,
what does that do?

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Does it come from outside in?

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like to you?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.293 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
remember that the body has

00:11:22.293 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
an outside and an
inside, but the biofield

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have an
outside and an inside.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
The biofield is us.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It's who we are in
between incarnations.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
See, we're in our particle
state now, the body.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
In the field we're in our wave
state or in our field state.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we're embodied, we have
both the particle, the body

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
state and the field state.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we die, we're
only in the field state

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.094 align:middle line:90%
until we create another body.

00:11:51.094 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're just
slowed down matter right

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.002 align:middle line:90%
now in these bodies.

00:11:54.002 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely, yeah.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We're light that's just
been trapped into form here,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
but that has information
encoded in it.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be able to
clear the field so it doesn't

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
predispose you to
marry another idiot

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:84%
or end up with a horrible job,
or-- so that you can learn it

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
inside and not have to learn
it through the next city

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
or the next marriage
or the next job.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is the most
beautiful definition

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation I have
heard, about the light body

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.435 align:middle line:90%
to create another body.

00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And then goes--

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.018 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --back into the

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and comes back down when it
wants to create another lesson.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But we do bring the coding,
the information back

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:90%
from the other lifetimes here.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying
with the intelligence

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have now or
the information that

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
has come into existence
now, it's always been there,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.582 align:middle line:84%

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and this very big angel
came out and said,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
you know it's going to be a very
challenging time on the earth.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be war.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be famine.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be rap music.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be--
and we need healers.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to come?

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And we all
volunteered because of

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
this tremendous
apocalyptic time that we're

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:90%
living through in the earth.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we all came here
to make a difference.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every single person.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.546 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Every single
one of us who's here.

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
We didn't come here to spend
another year in therapy.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We came here to
start a revolution.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why are so many
dying so early, then?

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Were you planning to
ask me this question all along?

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of us go home first
and some of us later.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But remember, what
you've asked is really

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:90%
the critical question.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Why are so many of us dying?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we are right now in the
sixth major extinction event.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Since the dawn of life on this
planet, there have been six.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the sixth
mass extinction event.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And they happen in a very,
very compact period of time.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The last one was
when a meteorite

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
struck the earth 65
million years ago

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Right now there are more species
dying per year than have ever

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:90%
perished in the past.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ever, yes.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: This is the
sixth major extinction event.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And Gaia, Mother
Earth, loves life.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And whenever she finds herself
in an extinction event,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
evolution is accelerated
tremendously.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And we can quantum leap.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
shamans speak about,

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.275 align:middle line:84%
that we are becoming
a new species.

00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a new human being
born on the planet today,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.502 align:middle line:90%
and it's us.

00:15:11.502 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's us, and
there's a whole generation

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
of babies and millennials
that have also come in.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But what about those that
are 50, 60, 70 years old?

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Can we rebirth into
that new generation?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, see, from
the perspective of biology,

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
evolution happens, quantum leaps
happen, in between generations,

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
so that maybe our kids will
be smarter and handsomer

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
than we are, or they'll be
the emerald, the rainbow,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:90%
the crystal children.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But for the shamans, evolution
happens within generations.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So you and I can take
that quantum leap.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And
maybe the children

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
will inherit the traits
that we develop, and they'll

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity to take
the quantum-- they're born

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more advanced.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to us to take it, to
create the morphogenetic field

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
that can establish a new human,
Homo luminous, in the planet.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the shamans
are really good at doing.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These kids
are coming in so smart

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that they don't need the elders,
except they can't find them

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
because they're so deep into
the rain forest at this point.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.477 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you a question
about the mass extinction?

00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
When you said that there was the
meteor that came in and wiped

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
out the dinosaurs,
it sounded like that

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:90%
was a fairly quick extinction.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.209 align:middle line:84%
But now this is a
slower experience.

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:32.625 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Mm-hmm.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why is it
slower, or what

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
do we do with that information,
that we could actually change?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: All of the
previous mass extinction events

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
have been catalyzed by
nature or by natural events.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.650 align:middle line:84%
A meteorite striking,
a food crisis

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in the planet where green
plants evolved because of a food

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:90%
shortage.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a big food
crisis in the planet.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Life was beginning to eat
not only the available

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:90%
food but each other.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And then these life forms
said, hey, wait a minute.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:84%
We can eat directly
from the sun.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
do chemosynthesis.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:90%
We can do photosynthesis.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a
discovery, incredible.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But 95% of the species
that lived at that time

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:90%
were destroyed.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:90%
These were all natural events.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a man-made
event, the pollution

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, the depletion of
the ozone, the climate change.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening very
rapidly in geological time.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.096 align:middle line:84%
It's happening within
the space of 20 years.

00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a time
that's terrifying,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's a time where
we can quantum leap.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To another planet or--

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: No, into
another being, into not Homo

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:90%
sapiens but Homo luminous.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Because what the shaman
traditionally did,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:90%
they had two central teachings.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The first one was they said
that the object of shamanism

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to get
out of this life alive,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
so to take your consciousness
with you beyond death.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And the second is to dream
the world into being.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Judeo-Christian
mythology, on the seventh day,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
God says that all creation's
complete, that all that's left

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
is the naming of the
plants and the animals.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the indigenous
mythologies,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
they say that on
the seventh day,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the great spirit said,
you know, I created

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:90%
the whales and the butterflies.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.385 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they beautiful?

00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And now you finish it.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Creation is not complete.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.265 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:18:47.265 --> 00:18:48.964 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have
that responsibility.

00:18:48.964 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: These are the
two things the shamans do.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
They create, and they take their
consciousness beyond death.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:90%
They complete creation.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:90%
They dream the world into being.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do they talk
about other galaxies

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
at all that are
existing in the state

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.104 align:middle line:90%
of our original existence?

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Mm-hmm, oh yeah.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: 65,000
billion years ago.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.759 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: And other realms.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.175 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do
they say of those?

00:19:13.175 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I know this is a
health conversation.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
We'll get back to that.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to ask
about the galaxies.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.663 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, they say
that it's really kind of very

00:19:21.663 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
narcissistic to think
that we're the only life

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.365 align:middle line:90%
forms in the universe.

00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, completely, yeah.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.011 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And that
there are worlds

00:19:27.011 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
that are energetic worlds
that are not even visible,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
but they're all
populated with life.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And that we transit
between those worlds of form

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and formlessness, the visible
and the invisible world.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you die, you don't
just wait to be incarnated back

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:90%
in the earth.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
When you journey to the next
world, if you go consciously,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
you're born into great fields
of beauty and consciousness,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.344 align:middle line:84%
where you continue
your evolution.

00:19:55.344 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do
that while you sleep?

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:57.968 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: And you do.

00:19:57.968 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
You visit them when you sleep.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
You can, yeah.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I believe that we do.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe that
and that there's information

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring back from
those other realms that are

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:90%
either evolved or de-evolved.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.044 align:middle line:90%
They're in their natural state.

00:20:14.044 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
However, I just
wanted to find out

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
what the shamans
had to say about it.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.595 align:middle line:84%
So, bringing it back down to the
conversation of the biofield,

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of our luminous energy--
which I love what we just did.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We went from here to here
to out to the realms,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and now we're back here again.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how we
can do this with healing.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned healing
within the biofield

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to change our past
in this lifetime.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.292 align:middle line:84%

Department of the Navy, is
diagnosed with a brain tumor.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And she goes to see
her neurologist, who

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
sends her to a neurosurgeon.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%

of my last book,
"Power Up Your Brain,"

Dr. Perlmutter, who's a
distinguished neurologist.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple
of healing sessions,

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
so she starts doing her
practice and her meditation.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:84%
She went through our
training program,

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so she knows the
self-healing methodologies.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
A month later, goes
in for another MRI,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and the tumor's gone.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the radiologist says,
well, these things just

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:90%
don't disappear.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%

00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:03.196 align:middle line:90%
He said no.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%

in the realm of the anomalous,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
of the extraordinary,
whereas for the shaman

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
this is in the realm
of the ordinary,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:90%
the realm of everyday miracles.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:84%

any longer.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's a perfect story,
as well as the medical system

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%

you had mentioned in part one,

and manages disease rather
than manages health.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
have had the experience
that they don't go back

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to who they were ever.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not an option.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Is that because it so
significantly changes deep,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:90%
deep into your psyche?

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: The plant
doesn't do anything.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The plant structurally is
identical to serotonin,

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:90%
which is a neurotransmitter.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's identical.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like your brain
is flooded suddenly

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:84%
with neurotransmitter and
all of it lights up at once.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So the
problem is being

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:84%
able to hold the
experience so it

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't become another great
adventure that you've had.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
the jungle, you

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
have to go through a dieta, or
a diet, with the neuro-nutrients

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and the brain
supplements that upgrade

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the brain so
you can bring it back 100%.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But even the 50% that
most people bring back

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:90%
is life changing.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's many ceremonies
around now, even the US.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Everywhere.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The plant has made its
way around the world.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It has.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.301 align:middle line:84%
But what would be, if someone
were to have a first time

00:29:05.301 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
experience, what would
you recommend as the most

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.489 align:middle line:90%
authentic experience?

00:29:10.489 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
remember, ayahuasca

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful
psychoactive

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.820 align:middle line:90%
agent known to the Indian.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is your brain on a
very powerful psychoactive.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be with a master.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Today everybody in
the Amazon is a shaman

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:84%
because you can buy the
ayahuasca in the market,

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of visitors come and
they want to have experiences.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:90%
You need to work with a master.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
go study mathematics,

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:90%
you want to go to MIT.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to learn about
your brain with ayahuasca,

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:84%
you want to work with
somebody who's masterful.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.231 align:middle line:84%
And you need to know what's in
the brew, what you're taking.

00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Because
they can mix in plants

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that are psychedelic but
don't have the healing

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:90%
benefit of the ayahuasca.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.254 align:middle line:90%
But it's extraordinary.

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the healing
benefit of it, other than the--

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It
repairs your brain.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.634 align:middle line:84%
One of the things it
does is that it upgrades

00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:90%
the quality of the brain.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.974 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Permanently.

00:30:02.974 --> 00:30:05.264 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, at least
for a short period until you

00:30:05.264 --> 00:30:06.492 align:middle line:90%
return to your regular diet.

00:30:06.492 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So,
because serotonin

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
will repair the regions in the
brain, the hippocampus, that

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
are associated with learning.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to learn
a new perspective on life.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you've had brain
trauma or brain injury,

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
is it something
that would repair?

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: No, we don't
prescribe it for brain injury.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But this is more for everyday
pathologies like you and I have

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and many other people
where we're stressed out

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and living with the
burdens of Western beliefs

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and civilization.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's very liberating,
can be very illuminating.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It has to be used with caution.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
that the standard diet,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.403 align:middle line:84%
if people go back
to the standard diet

00:30:49.403 --> 00:30:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and how toxic that
is for the brain.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
What is the diet
that is recommended

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that could repair and heal the
brain without the ayahuasca

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.337 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:31:00.337 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: When you do the
ayahuasca, have you done it?

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: You have to do it.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I know.

00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah, OK.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Go try it out.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would do
it with you, though.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: How much
time do we have?

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You lead the ceremonies?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.823 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: I don't.

00:31:15.823 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't lead journeys.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.108 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: There are
many people who do.

00:31:19.108 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Do it carefully.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But you want to feed your brain
the fats and the proteins.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And then
you want to fast

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of
days before you come

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.189 align:middle line:90%
into the ayahuasca ceremony.

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which we talked about,
the fasting, the importance

00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.963 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: The fasting
is really important.

00:31:35.963 --> 00:31:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
how do you maintain

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:44.040 align:middle line:84%
this really big picture
of what life is about,

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that your
nutrition is essential,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
being able to stop

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
the chatter of the mind, which
is that lymbic Neanderthal mind

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
we talked about in our first
program that's chattering all

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
the time, that's terrified,
that's angry, that's resentful,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that feels it was cheated,
that deserved better,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that that brain
needs to be stopped.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And you do that through
the right nutrients,

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
and then through going

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to places of power
in nature, which

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:84%
is what the shamans
call the vision

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:84%
quest, the journey to
places of power in nature

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
where you can be infused
with the power of the earth

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and of nature.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it
could be the ocean.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
mountain, where you

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:90%
feel that there is reverence.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Yes, a place that
has not been contaminated

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:90%
by civilization or by rubbish.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, in your book,
in "One Spirit Medicine,"

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
you bring about
mostly the experience

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that you've had over the
last three years of repairing

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
your entire body from
the level of toxicity

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that you picked up
from the traveling.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
important message

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.937 align:middle line:84%
that you want people to
take away from the book?

00:32:59.937 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, the book
is really the guidebook

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:84%
for transforming
human consciousness

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and in the process
healing the body.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what healed
my body, what

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:90%
allowed me to grow a new body.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I heal differently now.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I age differently.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it will also help
me to die differently.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably the
wisdom of the ancients,

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
together with the
neuroscience of enlightenment.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And in a really practical
guide that you can take,

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.636 align:middle line:84%
it has the diet, the nutrition
plans, the supplements--

00:33:37.636 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:84%
the supplements that upgrade
the brain, the supplements that

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:90%
detoxify the body.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it has it
at the biological,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
at the level of your
mind and your beliefs,

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and at the level of
your sacred journey.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:56.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you make your journey
through life a sacred one

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:90%
and not just getting--

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.635 align:middle line:84%
do have the mindset to

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You would catch those.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh, I do.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.804 align:middle line:84%
I get sick like
anybody else does.

00:34:11.804 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But
it goes through me

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
in two days instead
of two weeks.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because--

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Because disease
at the physical level

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:84%
tends to cling on to
cellular memories and trauma

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.090 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't cleared yet.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So the clearer you
become, the faster

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:90%
it goes through your system.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, and then in terms
of your mortality,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't feel like you have
any fear of your own death.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.324 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: I'm terrified of it.

00:34:39.324 --> 00:34:40.574 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are?

00:34:40.574 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually-- it's a
mixture of awe and terror,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's a great
journey to the unknown.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:84%
And I've been close to
death a number of times,

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and in the moment
there's no fear.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the thought of death
that makes us fearful.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The experience of
death is natural.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
We know how to be born,
and we know how to die.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We know how to do it.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.231 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:35:05.231 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We know how to transition
at a cellular level,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.709 align:middle line:90%
on a soul level.

00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to
have you take a look

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
at this clip of this video
called "Shaman Healer Sage"

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that actually Dr.
Villoldo talks about how

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to help you transition somebody
into death or another realm.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is extremely
helpful for people.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.515 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: He knew my mentor,
Antonio, and in the early days

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:84%
objected to my training,
believing that these teachings

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:90%
were only for the Indians.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Slowly with time, he came to
recognize that he came here

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to be a shaman to the world,
not only to his village,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to his tribe, to his region,
but to the entire earth.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was the very
first Westerner

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that he ever gave
his initiation to.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And after I received his
Karpai, his initiation,

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
he said to me, take
it into the world.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Share it with others.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't keep it for yourself only.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:90%
You, like me, are a bridge.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We're a bridge between the
ancient and the future.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And if our bridge collapses,
our children's children

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:84%
will have to rebuild
this world from scratch.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So I took him up on his offer.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I received his initiation.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I shared with others.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And I became a bridge
between the ancient medicine

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.115 align:middle line:84%
and the new science that is
emerging today in the West.

00:36:35.115 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.521 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you received
a lot of comments

00:36:37.521 --> 00:36:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of people that have really
used those techniques?

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: We get
them all the time.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've forgotten the
death rites in the West.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't--

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I didn't even know
there were death rites.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.348 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:36:48.348 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some religion, there's
a little bit of superficial.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But we've forgotten
how to help someone

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:90%
make the journey back home.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, we're going
to need to use these someday.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.894 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I had a friend who went
through a very difficult--

00:37:04.894 --> 00:37:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you go,
you want somebody

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that can help you, take
you at least to the doorway

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.385 align:middle line:90%
if not all the way through.

00:37:13.385 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But the rites were designed
to set the luminous body

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
free from the physical
body, to unwind the chakras,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
set the luminous body free,
and usher it to the highest

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
spiritual realm so
you don't get caught

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.890 align:middle line:84%
in the bardos or the
purgatories or those earthbound

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
places of suffering.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you address the
person that's left behind?

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
usually the hardest.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:84%
The person that's left behind
is still in this plane,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.569 align:middle line:84%
in this world dealing with the
aftereffects of the loved one.

00:37:43.569 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, you work
with the whole family.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to work with
the whole family.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one of our
students, English woman,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
very proper in her
mid-50s who had

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
lived in London during World War
II when the Nazis were bombing

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:90%
London nightly.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And one day, she
lost her way home,

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and the soldiers take her
to an anti-aircraft battery.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were shooting
at Nazi airplanes,

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:90%
and they hit this airplane.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And she swears she can remember
looking into the wind screen

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and seeing this young
German aviator that

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:84%
was also never going to go
back home to his mother.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.550 align:middle line:84%
She thought she
would never do that.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And the plane crashed.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I met her 40
years later, and she

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
had this amazing situation,
because the spirit

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.472 align:middle line:84%
of this young aviator had
attached itself to her--

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: --and had been
living with her for 40 years.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So we had to remove this
young man who did not

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
know that he was
dead-- he thought

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
he was in a nightmare he
couldn't wake up from--

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and then do the
death rites on him,

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.750 align:middle line:84%
who had died 40 years
earlier, to help

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.241 align:middle line:90%
him go across consciously.

00:39:06.241 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.573 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:39:07.573 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And what were her ailments?

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
she had no ailments,

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.940 align:middle line:84%
except that she could
not be in a sustainable

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
relationship, was always
drawn to military-like men.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But of course, she was
dedicated to this young man.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:90%
They were in relationship.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:28.299 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Now, this is not
the solution for anyone who just

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:90%
cannot get a good relationship.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.494 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, but
this specific story.

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: This
particular case--

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It further
describes the luminous body

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and how we do go from
the physical form

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to the light form to
spirit and then back.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.282 align:middle line:84%
And it can transcend
a number of ways.

00:39:47.282 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
this book is about.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've tried to
do with "One Spirit Medicine"

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and what we teach our students
at the Four Winds Society.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is to work
with the luminous body.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Yes, to work with
the subtle essence of who

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
we are and not only
with the gross.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, both is
necessary, as you describe.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.010 align:middle line:90%
But your wisdom is amazing.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Your way to communicate
it back to us

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%

am so grateful for.
