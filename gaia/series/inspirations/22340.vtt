00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, and welcome.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
In today's world, there are
so many different opinions

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:84%
of what the perfect
diet should be.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Vegetarian Journal,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
more and more people are moving
towards the raw food diet.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The American Cancer Society
says that more than half

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
of your daily intake
of food should

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
be fruits and vegetables.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
your choice is,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make it easy for
you today, and very convenient,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
for you to have the health the
benefits of a green food diet.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Victoria Boutenko.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:90%
She is a raw foodist.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And she's a pioneer in the
green smoothie revolution.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
She has the award-winning
book called "Green for Life,"

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and she's all about making green
foods practical, fun, and easy

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
for us to be able to consume.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA BOUTENKO: Thank
you for having me, Lisa.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.441 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:90%
You have so much knowledge.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
You tell such amazing
stories around food.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate what
you bring to this conversation.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So take us back to
when your family wasn't

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.862 align:middle line:90%
eating the raw food.

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
You're also known as The
Raw Food Family, which

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I think is great,
Raw Family is great.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:90%
But what happened before that?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Why did you decide to take your
family in the raw direction?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It
happened that as soon

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
as we immigrated to
the United States

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago, within
a year we started

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:90%
to become very, very sick.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And we came from Russia.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the Soviet
Union was very hungry.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:84%
We were deprived of
some basic nutrients.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we were really
going for food here.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was sure
that American food

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
is the healthiest in the world,
because it's the wealthiest

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And so food was supposed
to be the most nutritious.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't cut
myself on anything.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.721 align:middle line:84%
I just was eating everything
that was promoted.

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: About how
long ago was this?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It was 25 years ago.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 25 years ago.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.341 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And so
we became so ill,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
by 1994, 1993, we
became so sick.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I developed arrhythmia
and gained lots of weight.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And arrhythmia took
my father's life.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So I started to be
worried about that.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
My husband developed rheumatoid
arthritis and hyperthyroidism.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter, she was born
with asthmatic component,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and she developed asthma.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
She was now sneezing and
coughing every night.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And my son was diagnosed with
diabetes at the age of 9.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother died
from overdose of insulin,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
so I was afraid of
insulin more than disease.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.062 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had a
very sick family.

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Very sick family.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And my oldest son was
living separately,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
so he didn't participate
in that experiment.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.487 align:middle line:84%
So I was searching
and searching.

00:02:54.487 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that time we
lived in Colorado.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I was searching,
and one day I met

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
the woman who was in raw food.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe she was
the only one in Colorado

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:90%
at that time eating raw food.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And she told me
that our illnesses

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:90%
could be cured by raw foods.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And at first I was
very disappointed,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
because I love to eat.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But then she gave me the
book, she explained to me.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
She said birds don't cook
and snakes don't cook

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and tigers don't cook.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.855 align:middle line:90%
It's only humans.

00:03:22.855 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And then she said
we're supposed to eat

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
fresh fruits, vegetables,
nuts, and seeds.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.545 align:middle line:90%
And she gave me the book.

00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
sorry, I have to go.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.157 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This was
just a brief meeting.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I met her
in a line in the bank.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So did you just go
up to her and say,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%
you look great-- what do you do?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: For two months,
I've been stopping people

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
on the street who looked
healthier than others

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and asked them how they
achieved their health.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked her, she
said anything could be cured.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, even diabetes?

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:90%
She said even diabetes.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I cured my
colon cancer 15 years ago.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: From Stage 3.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the doctors
that you were going to,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.837 align:middle line:84%
the professionals that were
telling you how to get well

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
wasn't something you
wanted to follow.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.753 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Professionals
never told me I will get well.

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They told me that I could
control my symptoms.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.876 align:middle line:84%
And because I have
very good education,

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I actually went to
the medical library,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and I subscribed-- I checked
out the book about diabetes.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was a thick volume,
and on the first page,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
it said the cure is
unknown and the reason is--

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:90%
the cause is unknown.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.345 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
is then this book?

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's in
the rest of the book?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.219 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, if the
cause is unknown and the cure

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
is unknown, and it was
a very scary book that

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
told about losing the limbs
and the vision and kidneys.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.972 align:middle line:84%
And so I was thinking I
will do my own research

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:90%
and do something.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I found the
book by Dr. Whitaker,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
who said that diabetes could
be controlled by exercising.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because exercise brings more
insulin into your system.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Muscles produce exercise.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said that if you take
out dairy and meat, then

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
you need less insulin.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember I bought
running shoes for my son

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:90%
and for me.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.641 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized he
won't run without me.

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, from now on,
we're going to run every day.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because he was young.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we started running,
and within a year,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.282 align:middle line:84%
we were running Bolder Boulder,
the 10K Bolder Boulder.

00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.589 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It
was 1994, I think.

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can find us
there on the list.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
We all did it as a family.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:90%
So that was a good beginning.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided
to look for more.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:90%
And then I found raw food.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when I placed
him on raw food diet,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
his blood sugar just
never went up again.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
It was stabilized within
a matter of weeks.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it hard to do
coming from a Russian diet,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and then coming to the
Standard American Diet

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and going into raw food?

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Was that a challenging
transition to make?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.006 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Of course.

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:90%
It was never easy.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
It was difficult.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.242 align:middle line:84%
But the results were so fast to
show that I never looked back.

00:05:51.242 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It stated the case
pretty rapidly, didn't it?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.445 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult,
especially the first day.

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:56.861 align:middle line:84%
The first evening
was the hardest.

00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
just used to eating

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the long Russian late supper.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly we just do nothing.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We have these bananas sitting
there that were green bananas.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to pick
good bananas at that time.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And the wax covered apples.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:90%
And we were hungry.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we felt-- I
felt it was crazy.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't see anything else.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm into trying things.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And at night I heard somebody
walking in the kitchen opening

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.975 align:middle line:84%
all the drawers
looking for food.

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I cleaned the
kitchen really well.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You got
rid of everything.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.262 align:middle line:84%
The microwave, the
stove, everything.

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Everything.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I turned the pilot off
and covered the heat

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.071 align:middle line:90%
with a big cutting board.

00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The stove?

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: The stove.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning,
surprisingly, we

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
felt so much better.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.124 align:middle line:84%
My son told me, mom, my blood
sugar monitor is broken.

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, why do you think so?

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, because it
shows very low numbers.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, honey, it
doesn't work that fast.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though
he was eating fruit?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.355 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Fruit doesn't
really do anything.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, later in our living on
raw food, we tested fruit.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I was curious, should
I give him fruit or not?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would give him raw honey,
cooked honey, processed honey,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
raw fruit, and then just
anything else with the fruit.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I figured out that
even for watermelon,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
which is high glycemic index, if
I give him watermelon and test

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
his blood sugar, it will go
up for maybe 15, 20 minutes,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes below
what it was before.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.719 align:middle line:84%
So fruit doesn't really
cause high sugar permanently

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.244 align:middle line:90%
It's not the cause of diabetes.

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But those
sugar spikes are

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.826 align:middle line:90%
what you're trying to avoid.

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah,
but they really

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't affect him
in his disease.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
He got used to eating fruit
and he could consume fruit.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
He would eat mangoes
all the time.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But those
particular fruits

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%
have more fiber in them, right?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think fruit
is bad for humans.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.786 align:middle line:84%
As long as it's
ripe and organic.

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And balanced
with greens,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to learn
about in a little bit.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
However, I don't want to just
rave about raw food diet,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because I tend to do
everything in extreme.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I became fanatical
about being 100% raw.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And we've been raw
for 13 years, 100%.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we noticed that our
health is not really as perfect

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
as we felt I would say
first several years.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.999 align:middle line:84%
Something started to
show the deficiencies.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was very stubborn.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:90%
And I continued.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just would say,
oh, it's just detox.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Or it's something else.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:90%
I'm just tired.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I had to face it.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not the perfect
diet forever.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It did not work for us.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.842 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because we come
from cold climate.

00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the reason.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.416 align:middle line:84%
But it did not work
all the way for us.

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We started to have
brittle nails.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We started to have
sensitivity in our teeth.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I started to gain
weight, which was very, very

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
unfortunate for me
being a public speaker.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.246 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be healthy.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was believing I
was doing a good thing.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the very bad
cravings developed.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
So something was going on.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And also the skin
became very dry.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
to do my research.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It's 2003, 2004.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, how can
we find what can we eat?

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided to
start from scratch.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I thought, who
would be the animal

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that is the closest for humans?

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
If I find that animal, and
I go and see what they eat,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.557 align:middle line:84%
then I could figure
out, have an idea

00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:90%
what humans are supposed to eat.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
interesting way of thinking.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I was
thinking, it's not the pig.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like we're
really close to pigs.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel like rats.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But then when I saw chimpanzees,
they share with humans

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
99.4% of the same
sequence of genes,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
not just genes,
sequence of genes.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.884 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 99.4%.

00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, how lucky
I am that because Jane Goodall

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
has spent 30 years of her life
living in a tent in the jungle

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
and making research,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:90%
wrote volumes of information.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading
all her books,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
developed huge respect
for these animals.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there
is a trend now.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.939 align:middle line:90%
They call them humans now.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.715 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Not
animals, because they

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
have been proved
to be intelligent.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.945 align:middle line:84%
They can even learn
to talk sign language.

00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So they're very close.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
They're very close
to the human being.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes,
they're very close.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted to
see what they eat.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw what
they eat, I was really

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
shocked to see that half
of the diet is fruit.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I kind of knew that.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.982 align:middle line:84%
But that other 45% of
the diet is green leaves.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That was a shock to me.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I never knew that.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.525 align:middle line:90%
I thought it's a banana.

00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:54.747 align:middle line:90%
That's chimpanzee.

00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:55.996 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I went to many different
zoos, and I went to circuses.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.695 align:middle line:84%
And wherever I could find
a spot, the chimpanzee,

00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I would always go with a
big box of organic lettuce

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and ask permission to
feed, to take pictures,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to communicate, to see.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I observed how they would
just be so happy to eat greens.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You really are a
hands-on learner, aren't you?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I spent hours with some chimps
in circuses in other countries,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because in America
it's not allowed.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But I
wanted to know more.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, logically, if
they are 99.4% similar to us,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
our diet is supposed
to be 99% similar.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I made charts of human
diet, the typical human diet

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and the chimpanzee diet.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I made the
typical raw fooder's diet.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that we
are so far gone.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.299 align:middle line:90%
We are 100% different.

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And it
gave some ideas to me.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I saw that very
obviously that we're

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
missing the greens in our diet.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well do
chimpanzees develop things

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:90%
like cancer and diabetes?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Until
now they do not.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists were trying
to put AIDS into chimpanzees,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to develop
in them, for example hepatitis

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
C, and they were unable
to, because chimps,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
they have natural resistance
to these illnesses.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.572 align:middle line:90%
They cannot.

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They cannot use
them for animal testing

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
because they're--

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.171 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Unless they
put them on a human diet.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
That chart was very
interesting, because it

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
showed how much of the
Standard American Diet

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:90%
is consumed with wheat and--

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.914 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.914 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Processed foods.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Processed foods, yes.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
At what point did we get so
far away from the raw foods?

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen in history?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.349 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, I was very
interested in that question.

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:90%
And I've done lots of research.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there was not
enough scientific research

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And we could only
collect bits and pieces.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
However, I was able to spot
the very first cookbook written

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:90%
in English.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to the 13th century.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It was handwritten
cookbook by the chef

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.265 align:middle line:84%
of a very rich
family in England.

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to find this
book, and I looked through it.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course they ate all
kinds of meats and fish.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But every day they were
serving several-course dinners,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:90%
seven-course, six-course dinner.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And the first course
was always a huge salad,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
huge salad consisting of
more than 20 wild edibles,

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
such as violet and
dandelions and chives, wild.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
tear them apart by hand

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and sprinkle with
oil and some ripe

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
wine, which later
became vinegar.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And that was the first course.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They would just sit down
and eat, all of them.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
that people in the household,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:84%
including the servants,
horse man and the gardeners

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and everybody, were only
allowed to participate

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in the first course.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.309 align:middle line:90%
So that was their food.

00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was what they
made the most nutrient rich,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
if that was going to
be their only diet.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes,
and then the masters

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the-- the heads
of the family would

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
continue eating their
animal-rich or whatever,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
desserts.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.481 align:middle line:84%
But the whole household, people
were eating this first course.

00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And that was their meal.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they
would go home and eat

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
something else,
probably some porridge.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
main food for them.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.514 align:middle line:90%
They were sustaining on that.

00:14:20.514 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they made it the
best that they could basically

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:90%
make it.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.098 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah. yeah.

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so it goes
back to how we have raw foods

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and we've had raw foods in
our history for so long.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But what you specifically talk
about are the greens in foods.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, greens.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And greens are the
only living thing

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that could
transform sunshine into energy.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
You and I cannot stand in the
sun and produce nutrients.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:90%
The greens can.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And through the
photosynthesis, the sunlight

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
turns into liquid
called chlorophyll.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
So sunlight, you cannot touch.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:90%
The chlorophyll you can touch.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And then if I can take a minute
and explain how greens become

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
the most nutritious food on
the planet, I'll show you.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:90%
So this sunshine is energy.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It turns into carbohydrates.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the molecule
of chlorophyll

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is the base of any
molecule of sugar,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's date or
candy, or if it's honey,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
it all originated from the
molecule of chlorophyll.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So then this sugar
goes into the apple

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that grows on that
plant, or any fruit.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And half of it
goes into the root.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Roots are also very sweet.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Roots actually are
sweeter than the fruit.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why we make
our sugars out

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
of beet, yams, and
other root vegetables.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the different
microorganisms

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
are attracted to this
sweetness in roots.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the purpose
of sweetness in roots,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to attract microorganisms
in the soil, multiply them.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they break down the
compost, break down the humus.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:02.707 align:middle line:84%
And they create micronutrients,
non-organic minerals.

00:16:02.707 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the soil?

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Inorganic
calcium, inorganic potassium,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:90%
inorganic iron, inorganic.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And then the miracle happens.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
When the plants begin
to suck those nutrients

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
in with the water using
osmotic pressure, it moves up.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
As soon as this inorganic
nutrients reach the surface

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and the sunshine touches
them, it flips over,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and chemistry becomes biology.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.085 align:middle line:90%
They become organic.

00:16:27.085 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever is in
the plant is organic.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is in the
soil is inorganic.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.337 align:middle line:90%
You and I cannot eat soil.

00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But organic meaning that
they're nutrients and minerals.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They become
biological, have life.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:90%
They turn into live substance.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.216 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it can
happen with wheat.

00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It could happen with fruit.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.552 align:middle line:90%
It can happen with greens.

00:16:48.552 --> 00:16:50.385 align:middle line:84%
That's the chemical
transition that happens.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.718 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It happens through
the stem into the greens.

00:16:52.718 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this kale leaf is
approximately 45 days old.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And why do plants accumulate
all these nutrients?

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Because for the future babies
of the plant, for the seeds.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The seeds is the
future of that plant.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So they want to accumulate
enough so then they

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.955 align:middle line:90%
will give that into the seed.

00:17:12.955 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
And the green leaves are the
storage of that nutrition.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So at 45 days, it's
the perfect timing

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:90%
to harvest all these nutrients.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:84%
Because if you wait longer,
there will be a flower.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
the nutrients will

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.012 align:middle line:90%
begin to move into the bloom.

00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The new flower.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And
then into the seeds.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And after the seeds
are happening,

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
then it will become
yellow, bitter, brown,

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:90%
and it will become dry.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be
nutritious anymore.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.497 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you know
that that is 45 days old?

00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Approximately.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.154 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm a gardener.

00:17:46.154 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's the way it
looks when it's 45 days old.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of the more
nutrient-dense green foods

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.267 align:middle line:90%
on the planet is kale.

00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The most
nutritious food on the planet

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.389 align:middle line:90%
are greens before blooming.

00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Greens before blooming.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.846 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Or if it's
something like dandelion that

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
blooms on and on
and on all summer,

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:90%
that could be all summer long.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.059 align:middle line:84%
But you go for
younger leaves always.

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Earlier you'd said that the
carrot greens are actually

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.704 align:middle line:84%
more nutritious than
the carrots themselves.

00:18:15.704 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Any greens are more
nutritious than any roots.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And for example, chimpanzees
don't consume roots

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
until it's a disaster, like a
drought or something else that

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
destroys--

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
nothing else to eat.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:28.836 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we humans
are eating roots

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because we just-- of course,
it's better than French fries.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But roots have nutrition,
but greens have way more.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, the carrot
is rich in Vitamin A.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were told
by nutritionists at school.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But the
carrot greens, according

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to NutritionData.com, which
is official government site,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
so the greens of carrot

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:90%

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that where
you get the information

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
on the nutrients of the
actual wild edibles?

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.265 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, well,
this one of my main--

00:19:05.265 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:90%
yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Or the same with the beets.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Almost 200 times more
vitamin A in the greens

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:90%
than in the beets.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Now why do you-- and you are
the queen of green smoothies,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
as we're going to see later on
with an amazing demonstration

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:90%
of how to make these smoothies.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And really, it takes
visuals to see how easy

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:90%
and how beautiful it is.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Why do you combine the
fruits and the vegetables

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.947 align:middle line:90%
in the smoothies?

00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You know,
Lisa, in fact, I never

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
combine fruits and vegetables,
because it's a poor combining.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.345 align:middle line:90%
I only combine greens and fruit.

00:19:37.345 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The distinction
is because vegetables

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:90%
are more starchy.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You know
how the cow produces

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:90%
dairy and cow produces meat?

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't call meat dairy
or dairy called meat.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the same source,
but they are different.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
So do the plants.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:90%
How different are these two?

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And how different is
greens with the vegetable?

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.772 align:middle line:90%
Vegetables have starch.

00:19:58.772 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine
starch with the fruit,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:90%
it's a poor combination.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.954 align:middle line:90%
And it could cause problem.

00:20:03.954 --> 00:20:05.703 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Gastric problems
and inflammation.

00:20:05.703 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It could cause flatulence, gas.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.232 align:middle line:84%
My children used to
call it gas for less.

00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]
So the nutrients

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that are found in the
green leafy vegetables--

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and we've heard this
many, many times--

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
are the most
nutrient-dense foods

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that we can eat, with the
exception of maybe the camu

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
camu nut, and there's a
few other various things

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.115 align:middle line:84%
you might find deep
into the rainforest.

00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But these are what's
readily available to us.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Now you have this
magic of putting these

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
into these beautiful
smoothies, which we actually

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:90%
have a picture of.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You really make it so
aesthetic and pleasing

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
because of the natural
colors of all of the foods.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you find your protein
in this particular diet?

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: What does
the cow eat for protein?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Do farmers feed
the cows protein?

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Or do they inject
protein into the cows?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:90%
What do cows a eat all the time?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Where do cows get protein?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.991 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Grass, wheat-- they
don't get protein, do they?

00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: If you ever smell
the freshly milked milk,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.685 align:middle line:84%
then you will smell
the grassy smell.

00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:16.685 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the grass.

00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
protein in cows get.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They say you need to
eat beef for protein.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It comes from greens.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so greens is the
original source of protein.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And lately, I've been talking
to a lot of naturopaths,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and they say that many people
develop-- even children develop

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
kidney failure because of
over consumption of protein.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Because our kidneys can
only process so much

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:90%
protein per day.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And our food is so loaded with
heavy, hard-to-process protein,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:90%
then the kidneys begin to fail.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
tests you could do

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
on that, if someone consumes
a little bit of beets,

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and if urine becomes a pink
color, that means your kidneys

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
don't really process
the entire protein.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Your kidneys are already weak.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes from the
green from original source,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:90%
the body recognizes that.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's something the
body's made for.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.024 align:middle line:84%
And so body could easily
figure out how much to take.

00:22:15.024 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Doesn't
the body also need

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
protein for building
blocks for cellular repair?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Body needs
protein, of course.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And body gets lots of
protein from greens.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Greens have way more
protein that one can think.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, fruits have very
low protein, about like 6%.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.871 align:middle line:84%
But greens have up to
40% of protein content.

00:22:32.871 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that again
found on the website

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.124 align:middle line:90%
that you were mentioning?

00:22:36.124 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.539 align:middle line:90%
NutritionData.com.

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I actually
have seen that protein

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.899 align:middle line:84%
is found in broccoli,
in what other-- in kale?

00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Is protein found in kale?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Any greens
are very high in protein.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Romaine, red leaf lettuce
is very high in protein.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're very easily
assimilated, the protein is.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes,
because it comes

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in a separated amino acids,
which is very easy for body

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:84%
to process and
combine in the system.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Some animal sources
could have other things

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in it, not protein, for example,
omega-3 fatty acids or B12

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
or vitamin D, that some
plants might not have.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But protein we don't
have to worry about.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
There is plenty of
protein in greens.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.721 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about amino acids?

00:23:23.721 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well amino
acids is protein.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, but that's
also found in the greens?

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: All nine
essential amino acids

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:90%
are found in greens.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And I list them in my book,
and I even list how much,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and I compared it with chicken.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, there's a
lot of great comparison

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.871 align:middle line:90%
charts in the book.

00:23:39.871 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%
That's terrific.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.080 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's
talk about-- we

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:84%
were talking about combining
the fruit and vegetables

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and how if you-- you don't
do it with vegetables,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
you combine fruit
with the greens.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you make
the smoothies that

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
are pretty high in the fruit,
aren't the calories pretty high

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The calories are
not as high as in any processed

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You cannot really make a cup
of smoothie more than 300 grams

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.495 align:middle line:84%
with just fruit-- more
than 300 calories.

00:24:07.495 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.578 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You cannot really
create a cup of smoothie with

00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
more than 300 calories in it.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Even if you put whatever fruits
you choose, even a coconut,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.740 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.054 align:middle line:84%
You can't get up to a
1,000-calorie smoothie if you

00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:20.554 align:middle line:90%
really try?

00:24:20.554 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You have
to make a quart.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
In the quart you can make
1,000, which will be four cups.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in an 8-ounce glass,
really with the normal amount

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of fruit, you can't get
much over 300 calories?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No, no.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these
are some examples

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of some of the beautiful
smoothies that you've done.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I love in this
particular picture

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
how they don't all
blend together.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Because each one of the
mango, and there's an avocado

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and a strawberry there--
they stay separated.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because to
this particular smoothie,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.414 align:middle line:90%
I added psyllium husk powder.

00:24:55.414 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Psyllium husk.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Psyllium husk powder,
and that turns it into pudding.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:90%
It solidifies.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good fiber.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's healthy.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it stays
the same color.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I make one
pitcher of green.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I pour
it in little bit.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I make yellow
and then I put red.

>>LISA: And psyllium husk
comes from corn, right?

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.215 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: No, psyllium
husk is this husk

00:25:18.215 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that grows on the
seed of plantain,

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:90%
which is a wild edible.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
causes the-- well, that's

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.114 align:middle line:84%
the soluble fiber that
we need in our diets.

00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.321 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That brings
me to a question.

00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Difference between
juicing and smoothies,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
juicing and blending--
what's the difference there?

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well,
there could be a reason

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to drink juice or a
smoothie in different times.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I find that smoothies,
first of all, they're

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
much more practical.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if you want
to juice, to you

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:84%
have to be really
committed to that.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
at least one hour,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
including cleaning
and preparing.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does take a while.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And it does
take a lot of waste.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
It's way more expensive.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to put more things
to have a cup of juice.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.027 align:middle line:84%
And practically also you
have to drink it right away.

00:26:06.027 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to drink
it three times a day

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
or four times a day, you have
to juice it four times a day.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.415 align:middle line:84%
And the smoothie, it takes three
minutes, including cleansing.

00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me somebody
who cannot do it.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You will see in the food demo
how it's really so simple.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I have children, I went to
schools in Ashland, Oregon,

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was demonstrating to
children in the Waldorf school

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
how to make smoothie.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
making smoothie.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:90%
They loved it.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were so
original with that.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They will just stick
their finger and try it,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and they say, wow,
this is even better.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.876 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is very natural
just to throw a bunch of fruits

00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:90%

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
In this picture here, you
can see how kids are easy.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
They put the food in, and
they put the fruit in,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's a lot of fun.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.871 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
to cook anything.

00:30:38.871 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's the good
part about it.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:84%

>>BOUTENKO: Oh, it's fun.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Yes, most animals, since
they try green smoothies--

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.024 align:middle line:84%
if you have a dog, and
you make green smoothie

00:30:55.024 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and share it with
the dog, the dog

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.069 align:middle line:84%
will recognize when the
blender starts to make noise.

00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It will be right
there in the kitchen

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.835 align:middle line:90%

Who knows what's in dog food?

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And your dogs eat
green smoothies?

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: When we had dog,
our dog lived complete life,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and was very healthy
until the very last.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And she was eating
only raw food.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We gave her some raw
meat twice a week.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But she was eating oats
and pulp from the juicing.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the last years, she
got to drink some smoothies

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:90%
in her last years.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Now we have a cat.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
For the cat, we have to
prepare separate smoothie,

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:84%
because cats cannot
have no fruit.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You are a complete
raw food family.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So how did we get so
far away from this?

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
At what point did we get so
far away from eating like this?

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I was very
curious about this.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And I found out the answer.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It was during the
Industrial Revolution,

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
which happened
about 108 years ago.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It just happened that everything
was invented at that time,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:84%
matches and mattresses
and showers,

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
many things-- sewing
machine, bicycles.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And English chemist invented
the process of refining sugar

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.952 align:middle line:90%
108 years ago.

00:32:09.952 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The sugar mill.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.355 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And suddenly
sugar became available.

00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Instead of apples that were
the sweetest thing people could

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
get, people started
to have confection.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the scientists,
they found sugar

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:84%
in the human tissue
of the brain.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:90%
And they made conclusion.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If there is sugar there, so
we need sugar for thinking.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually
blessed it, and they said,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:84%
you need sugar,
especially give it

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to your children
and pregnant women.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Because we need it for thinking.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And people loved sugar.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And then a Swiss miller invented
metal grinder for his mill.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And instead of making the
very coarse, brown flour,

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:84%
he was able to make
puffy, white flour.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, people
started to live in big cities,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and there was
hunger, starvation.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:84%
People were dying in the
winter time from starvation.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Imagine they were able to
make macaroni and spaghetti

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
from white flour, survival food.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You make it in harvest
time in September,

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and then it could
stay for two years.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Even bugs don't eat it.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it makes
plenty of food.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.786 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And
then you just boil

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:90%
it and it gives you calories.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can survive till the
first greens in the forest.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And along with the white bread.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in taking this
process of processing

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
the wheat, how
did it then become

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.312 align:middle line:84%
what we know today as white
and bleached and refined?

00:33:31.312 --> 00:33:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: We still have it.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the third component was
when Napoleon the Great wanted

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to conquer the
world 108 years ago,

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and exactly he wanted
to conquer Russia,

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
he didn't know how
to feed the army.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:90%
That was the biggest problem.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:90%
So he announced a competition.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And a French chef came up
with the canning process.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:84%
The first canned food was
boiled for six hours nonstop

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:90%
to kill all the bacteria in it.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:90%
This was his idea.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he would seal those
containers, glass or porcelain

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:84%
containers, with
pitch, with a pitch.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, they
would weld it.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.658 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:34:08.658 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
No, they were
closed with a pitch.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.396 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:13.396 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: OK, and
so this was the food

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
that the French army
had at Waterloo.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It didn't spoil even
in the summer hot days.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then English spies got this
secret, this military secret.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And the English were much
more economical and pragmatic.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, six
hours is a lot of fuel.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:90%
It's very expensive.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The fuel was very
expensive at that time.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So they said, can we
possibly kill the bacteria

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.480 align:middle line:84%
without boiling,
with some poison?

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the opponents
said, but who

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:84%
will eat the food
with the poison?

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we don't
have to call it poison.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.391 align:middle line:90%
We could call it preservatives.

00:34:48.391 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll give it a nice name.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is
how this all happened.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And this
is all how it started.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
bring boiling time down

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
to 20 minutes.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they said ceramic
or glass is not economical.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:90%
It breaks very fast.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:90%
What can we find else?

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
They found the cheapest
possible metal, which was tin.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:90%
We use it until now.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
To mask the taste
of preservatives,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:84%
they used lots of spices
and garlic and onion

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%
in the preserves.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And this preserves, they
took over really big.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:90%
It was the most processed food.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors at that
time, they blessed it, too.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.250 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, this
is predigested food.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It is better than fresh.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:84%
You should eat it
even in the summer.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It is easy on your
digestive system,

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
especially give it to
children and pregnant women.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And so 108 years ago,
humans had the biggest,

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:84%
the most magnificent
shift in the way humans

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:90%
eat in human history.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And several years
later, humans developed

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
epidemics of four illnesses:
epidemics of scurvy,

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:84%
epidemics of rickets,
vitamin D deficiency,

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
epidemics pellagra,
vitamin B deficiency,

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and in the east
countries, very, very.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Pellagra in 1915 in the
United States alone,

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:84%
10,000 people died
from pellagra.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge epidemic.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But before that,
though, there was plague,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
there was famine, there
was other illnesses.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But it was because
of a lack of food.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They were not
based on lack of food.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They were with hygiene
and other reasons.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But these were
caused specifically--

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
scurvy was caused by lack
of vitamin C. By the way,

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I looked up-- I
was curious to see

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:84%
how did they treat
scurvy at that time?

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I put it in one of my books
that they were treating it

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:84%
with mercury, sulfur,
purging, and bleeding.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
That's how we were
treating scurvy.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And today, you know
how to treat scurvy.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.931 align:middle line:84%
You just eat some
fruits and vegetables.

00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vitamin C.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And you
know what, Lisa?

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised if
another 20, 50, 100 years--

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:84%
hopefully not-- pass
and we will be told,

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:84%
you just need to be
more fruits and veggies

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.242 align:middle line:90%
to cure breast cancer.

00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's what
we're being told now.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much evidence
around the 100% raw diet

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.019 align:middle line:84%
going towards the healing of
various cancers and so forth.

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's many, many
different protocols around that.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.976 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different philosophies.

00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
interesting story.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And you and I,
only the seventh generation

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of people grown on
that processed food.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On cooked food.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.784 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: On predominantly
processed foods.

00:37:34.784 --> 00:37:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is that at that time

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
also, the microscope was--
technology of microscope

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
was improving.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And Louis Pasteur made
his discovery at that time

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So doctors were sold out on
this bacteriological reason

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.900 align:middle line:84%
for disease, and so
they did not connect

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the predigested processed foods
with the illnesses, the scurvy

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:90%
and rickets.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they told people
they need to take medicine.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Chemistry was developing.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So they started to prescribe
medicine to people.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And that, on top
of deficiencies,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.216 align:middle line:90%
it added toxicity.

00:38:09.216 --> 00:38:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we started to
have all this hypertension

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.444 align:middle line:84%
and osteoporosis and
psoriasis and diabetes.

00:38:17.444 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
All of these
degenerative diseases

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:90%
started to flourish and bloom.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And until now, they
grow in numbers.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, people now, if
they avoid the raw food diet,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:84%
they would avoid it because
they can't break down

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:90%
the enzymes or the food as well.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they're afraid
of the bacteria

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.480 align:middle line:90%
around the organic foods.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts
of different reasons

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that people come
up with not to eat

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:90%
a raw-- completely raw food.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.622 align:middle line:84%
And it not being convenient,
those types of things.

00:38:45.622 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Convenience, yes.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Convenience and
108 years ago, it

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
was also considered
progressive way of eating.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And for the sake of fashion,
we would do anything.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Recently there was a fashion
to show underwear when you go.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And you do whatever if
you want to be considered

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:03.750 align:middle line:90%
progressive and fashionable.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see, yes.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back to
the way of eating here.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever recommend,
for convenience reasons,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:90%
having a green powder?

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of green
powdered supplements

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
available to make
it more convenient

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:90%
yet still get the nutrients.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.735 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever do that?

00:39:19.735 --> 00:39:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I personally don't.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
that I don't really

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:90%
believe any packaged foods.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
skeptical about it.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a system
behind any producer.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so much easier
to put some preservative that

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
will keep the color green or
keep it from caulking together.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.619 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most everything
that's packaged is.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I prefer to see
what I put into my blender.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.509 align:middle line:84%
And I see that this is an apple,
and I see that this is a green.

00:39:51.509 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A whole, complete food.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, and
it's certified organic.

00:39:54.675 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So I feel so much
more at peace when

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:90%
I see what I put in my food.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.190 align:middle line:90%
So I don't like.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But I see what somebody really
is busy or traveling a lot,

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe powders would
be the next thing.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.624 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Better than
cooked French fries.

00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I notice that
you put a lot of water

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:90%
in your smoothies.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see that later
on in the demonstrations.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Does the water by any chance
dilute the effectiveness

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:90%
of the enzymes in the raw foods?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That was one of
my concerns in the beginning.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
However, I have conducted
15 green smoothie

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:84%
week-long retreats in
the last few years.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have sensed that every
single person was refreshed,

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:84%
nourished and the health
was improved tremendously.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people with
diabetes who would come.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Not that I asked them
to come with diabetes.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But they will say,
well I have diabetes.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm on pills or I'm on insulin.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Or people with heart problems
or people with cancer

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:90%
will come to my retreats.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Psoriasis and tremor and
all kinds of problems,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:90%
incurable illnesses.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And then after one week, the
difference in them was so huge.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.697 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, there was a
woman who, after seven days,

00:41:08.697 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:90%
her mother didn't recognize her.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Her mother came to meet her, to
pick her up and bring her home.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And she was standing,
and-- her daughter

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
was standing waiting for her
mother, and mother passed her.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.100 align:middle line:84%
She looked so different, so much
younger, so much more vibrant

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that her mother
didn't recognize her.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know skin is
one of the biggest elimination

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:90%
organs on the body.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you put in is directly
what comes out of the skin,

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.946 align:middle line:90%
So this does help for psoriasis?

00:41:36.946 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a very,
very painful disease.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes, yes.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that--
I receive so many emails

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.090 align:middle line:90%
from people, about 80 per hour.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And they tell me their stories.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So one woman said that whenever
she would add flour or rice

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to her diet, her
psoriasis comes back.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.547 align:middle line:84%
Whenever she takes it
out, it will go away.

00:41:57.547 --> 00:41:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You can actually

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You could put-- I think I
read in one of your books

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:09.006 align:middle line:84%
avocado, plantain, and
what was the other thing

00:42:09.006 --> 00:42:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can make
a paste out of?

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: There
could be plantain.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Dandelion.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.522 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.522 --> 00:42:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And put it
directly on your skin?

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You can just puree it in a--

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that our
body's fed from inside.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:90%
But of course yes.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Strawberries you could
put on your skin.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I understand
that your food-- your son

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:90%
is a huge wild edibles fan.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:84%

And they have to be--
But he teaches it.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.255 align:middle line:84%
There's an app
that he has, right?

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Because my son had diabetes,
I told him, son, you

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.390 align:middle line:84%
will have to find a
profession that you

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:90%
will have to move a lot.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to either run four
miles every day forever

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:84%
or you have to find
your expertise somewhere

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.460 align:middle line:90%
where you could be moving.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.565 align:middle line:90%
So he's teaching dancing.

00:42:54.565 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:84%
One of his expertise is
he's teaching salsa dancing.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And also he was taking guided
tours in the wilderness.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he became really
interested in the forest.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:90%
He loves forest.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he became so
really well knowledgeable

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:15.850 align:middle line:84%
about wild edibles that often I
call him and ask him questions.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.066 align:middle line:84%
Like recently I found
something in my backyard,

00:43:18.066 --> 00:43:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
it's edible or not.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So I just called him and
I explained and showed him

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.810 align:middle line:90%
on Skype.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said that's
for sure that--

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, he modernized it

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I made the
green smoothie app.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.214 align:middle line:84%
And he followed my steps
and made wild edible app.

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
such a great idea.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.610 align:middle line:84%

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:84%
can look at whatever you
have in your refrigerator.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.833 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Exactly.

00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Because people say,
how do I remember

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.512 align:middle line:84%
all of that when I
go to the store, what

00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:49.470 align:middle line:90%
to put in the smoothie.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
much experience.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:84%

Purslane, as well
as lamb's quarters,

And it has become
customary in my family

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to seek out organic farmers

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
quarters problem and
ask them if we might

be able to help them weed and
collect some of these weeds

If you don't want
any guesswork, you

00:45:29.465 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:84%
can actually plant these
seeds in your garden

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.520 align:middle line:90%
and grow wild edibles.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what we often
do in our garden.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.262 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:41.845 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this
is lamb's quarters.

00:45:41.845 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And lamb's quarters really
likes dry, arid areas.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:90%
It likes to grow in the sun.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So chances are, if you have
a vacant lot or a ditch

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:84%
around your neighborhood
or just a field,

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:84%
you can find lamb's
quarters there.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:56.705 align:middle line:90%
It grows pretty big.

00:45:56.705 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And its identifying
characteristic

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.055 align:middle line:84%
is this white dust that
you see on the leaves.

00:46:03.055 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And that white dust
is pure protein.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.205 align:middle line:84%
I never wash it off
because it's pure protein.

00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>How tall is it?

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>It goes everywhere
from here to here.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It has a very stocky
stem, very fibrous.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like wood almost.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I never really use
the stem because it's

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot of insoluble fiber.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's got a very nice taste.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It kind of takes mild
like spinach, not too

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:90%
much of a chlorophyll taste.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.130 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I just take the leaves
and I throw them

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960 align:middle line:90%
straight into a blender.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And it helps my body.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:90%

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Clover.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.135 align:middle line:84%
How many people can
recognize clover?

00:46:55.135 --> 00:46:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.470 align:middle line:90%
So clovers are edible.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if you can
help me identify them.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.263 align:middle line:90%
How many leaves?

00:47:01.263 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Three.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Three, unless
you're really lucky.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Then there's four.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.192 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.192 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
four leaf clovers

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.565 align:middle line:84%
are more nutritious
than three leaf clovers?

00:47:08.565 --> 00:47:09.295 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:47:09.295 --> 00:47:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Nah.

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>25% more.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:11.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.220 align:middle line:90%
There's one extra leaf.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So clovers are our
blood purifiers.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.500 align:middle line:84%
They help to cleanse
our blood and fight

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.390 align:middle line:84%
cancer growths, any
kind of cysts or tumors.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You can eat the stem, the
flower, and the leaves.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.645 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:28.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Victoria just said
during the break

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that his diabetes
was a blessing.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.310 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.540 align:middle line:84%
That's an incredible
thing to say.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Because look at the
path that he's taken

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.795 align:middle line:84%
and how many people
that he has educated.

00:47:42.795 --> 00:47:44.880 align:middle line:84%
There are--
Actually, we're going

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to take a-- we're going to do
a whole food demonstration.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
show you how to use

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the wild dandelions
in a smoothie.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And Victoria's going
to go through each--

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.726 align:middle line:84%
how to prepare them,
different nutritional value

00:47:58.726 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:90%
of the different smoothies.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to take
note on how quickly

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and how easily we can
whip up some incredibly

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.760 align:middle line:90%
nutritious drinks.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
a beautiful thing

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that you said about
your son, too.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.551 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: My pleasure.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.660 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
we're going to, again,

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:84%
as I said, look at how
to make the smoothies.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn more about
the green food revolution.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
find out different ways

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can easily and
conveniently support

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:27.937 align:middle line:90%
your health.

00:48:27.937 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:35.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:84%
My guest is raw foodist
Victoria Boutenko.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about how easy
it is to make green smoothies

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and to add vitality and energy
and healing to your life.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And look at how
beautiful this is.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really doesn't
get more colorful than this.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And this all comes from nature.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.219 align:middle line:84%
So let's make this really
super easy for people.

00:48:58.219 --> 00:48:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're doing.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.140 align:middle line:90%
We're making--

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Sometimes I get
emails from people saying,

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:90%
my green smoothies are so bad.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I just cannot drink them.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I just throw them in a compost.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot imagine making
a bad green smoothie.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:12.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You need to take high quality,
preferably organic, greens

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and high quality,
ripe, organic fruit.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And water and love.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And it will be good.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So today I'm going to
use variety of greens

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and a variety of fruit
just to explain some.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now once
again, the greens

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:35.064 align:middle line:84%
counteract the glycemic
index of the fruit, right?

00:49:35.064 --> 00:49:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.450 align:middle line:84%
The chlorophyll
and fiber in greens

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.670 align:middle line:84%
slow down the absorption
of sugars in the fruit.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally safe
to consume for people

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.935 align:middle line:84%
who have candida or diabetes
or any other sugar intolerance.

00:49:46.935 --> 00:49:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, really.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because really it
balances out perfectly.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.126 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, absolutely.

00:49:51.126 --> 00:49:52.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with the chard.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have here rainbow
chard, which is so pretty.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So pretty.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And of
course this plant

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is called in
Australia silver bead

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and in Africa it's
called spinach.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.934 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to call it
by American name, chard.

00:50:05.934 --> 00:50:06.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's rainbow.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cut the ends.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, just look at that.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.350 align:middle line:90%
I just want to show that.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:10.349 align:middle line:90%
This is so beautiful.

00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I'm going to use
them for decoration in the end.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.665 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: OK.

00:50:14.665 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to ask
you, Lisa, to help me.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.456 align:middle line:90%
Because I like to remove the--

00:50:19.456 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The stem.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.988 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The stem,
because it gives it

00:50:21.988 --> 00:50:25.876 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a peppery
flavor that I don't really

00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:27.000 align:middle line:90%
appreciate in the smoothie.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can use them
later somewhere.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.107 align:middle line:90%
So if you could just--

00:50:31.107 --> 00:50:32.564 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Specifically
with the chard

00:50:32.564 --> 00:50:33.840 align:middle line:90%
you want to remove the stem.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.111 align:middle line:84%
Chard and kale and
collard, those three.

00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: The spinach I don't.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.279 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I would
like to get this kale.

00:50:41.279 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Now that's kale.

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.952 align:middle line:84%
Kale is a beautiful-- leaves
on kale are very curly leaves.

00:50:46.952 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.120 align:middle line:84%
There are different
kinds of kale,

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.410 align:middle line:90%
but this is called curly kale.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.965 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm going to do,
I'm just going to do this.

00:50:52.965 --> 00:50:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, well that was easy.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:54.926 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Back to chopping here.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Now kale has-- why
is so many people--

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:01.960 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be the new
designer vegetable, kale.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Eat more kale.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I see so much of that.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.295 align:middle line:84%
What is in kale
that is so magical?

00:51:06.295 --> 00:51:07.820 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Kale has some
phytonutrients and antioxidants

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been claimed to
cure and reverse cancer.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty serious.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think also we intuitively
now cling to consume something,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:90%
we consider it pretty now.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.917 align:middle line:90%
And see how strong it is?

00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is very strong.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine, it's
made from liquefied sunlight?

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.065 align:middle line:90%
We cannot touch sunlight.

00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.126 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But we
can touch the greens.

00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I want
to get all of it.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So kale, as you explained, is
there a reason for the texture

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:84%
being more tough
than spinach texture?

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, this is one
of the darkest green-- darkest

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:52.477 align:middle line:90%
green green.

00:51:52.477 --> 00:51:54.393 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the darker--
the bitter the better,

00:51:54.393 --> 00:51:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I've always heard.

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
darker, the better.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the darker the
green, the more vitamins,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.454 align:middle line:84%
nutrients you're going to
find inside your vegetable?

00:52:00.454 --> 00:52:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Absolutely, yes.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's just a
good rule of thumb anyway.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people use green
cabbage or white cabbage.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And they say, is it OK to use
cabbage in green smoothie?

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just not green enough.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.200 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's good
for other things,

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.100 align:middle line:90%
but not for the green smoothie.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I've also
heard that when you blend it

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.860 align:middle line:84%
in a high-speed speed blender,
it breaks down the consistency

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
so it's not as
difficult to digest.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:30.282 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: A high-speed blender
blends it and breaks down the--

00:52:30.282 --> 00:52:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cellular level.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Cellular
level, yeah.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that ensures that all
your nutrients are completely

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.354 align:middle line:90%
absorbed by the body.

00:52:38.354 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not
difficult to digest.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And this basically
does what, say,

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.647 align:middle line:84%
cooking would do in terms
of breaking down the enzymes

00:52:45.647 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
so that they're more digestible
and assimilatable in the body.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Not necessarily
enzymes, but the nutrients.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The nutrients.

00:52:51.716 --> 00:52:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
greens have so much more--

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.600 align:middle line:84%
for example beets is known
to have lots of calcium.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But beet greens have
six times more calcium

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.150 align:middle line:90%
than the beet bulbs.

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.941 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh. really?

00:53:03.941 --> 00:53:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So greens are high
in all nutrients, calcium,

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:10.090 align:middle line:90%
potassium, sodium, zinc, copper.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.490 align:middle line:90%
You name it-- everything.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when you blend
them really well,

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.550 align:middle line:84%
then you have abundance
all these nutrients.

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.655 align:middle line:84%
You become healthy;
you become nourished.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: People cannot

>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.251 align:middle line:84%

definitely where

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the greens tend

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, I

>>BOUTENKO: Green smoothies--
the proof is in the smoothie.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.623 align:middle line:90%
That's what I like to say.

00:53:55.623 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you also
make puddings, too.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So the reason you're
adding water here

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.162 align:middle line:84%
is to liquefy it easier and
make it a little thinner?

00:54:04.162 --> 00:54:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.740 align:middle line:84%

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.278 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But I first I'd
like to start with the mangoes.

00:54:58.278 --> 00:55:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Mango is my favorite fruit
to add to the smoothie.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It has to be ripe.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be soft,
but never to have

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:09.790 align:middle line:90%
any brown or black spots.

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It has to
always be no blemish.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Solid color.

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.068 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, solid color.

00:55:14.068 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And so these are perfect
mangoes for that.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And they're organic.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I do, I just cut
it very close to the pit.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.079 align:middle line:84%
And then I take a spoon and
I scoop it out like this.

00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They tend to be very
high in fiber, don't they?

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:29.911 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They
are a kind of fiber,

00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because they have both
soluble and insoluble fiber.

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I've cut into
an unripe mango before,

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.957 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
difficult to cut.

00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So if this is-- did you
just see how easy it

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:44.460 align:middle line:84%
was for Victoria
to cut this mango?

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.654 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's very
ripe and softer in texture.

00:55:47.654 --> 00:55:49.445 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Nobody
should eat unripe fiber.

00:55:49.445 --> 00:55:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And explain why.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because as the
mother breastfeeds the baby,

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.780 align:middle line:84%
the longer the
baby is breastfed,

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the healthier is the baby, the
more nourished is the baby.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So when the fruit stays on
the vine as long as possible,

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.370 align:middle line:84%
preferably to the time
you take it and eat,

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:12.160 align:middle line:84%
it is more nutritionally
valuable, much more nutrition.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.944 align:middle line:84%
It keeps getting
something from the tree.

00:56:13.944 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it gets more
nutritionally valuable

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.650 align:middle line:90%
the riper it is.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:17.871 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

00:56:17.871 --> 00:56:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:19.250 align:middle line:90%
All right, great.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And any particular
reason you chose mango?

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
mango makes any smoothie

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:90%
into perfect consistency.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It balances it out.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.531 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's so full.

00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It has seven grams of
soluble fiber in it.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:36.026 align:middle line:84%
So it's perfect fix
for any green smoothie.

00:56:36.026 --> 00:56:36.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:38.342 align:middle line:84%

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Now I'm
going to add bananas.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'll stay
with the mangoes.

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We'll keep adding
things in until it's full.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You really can't go
wrong in these types of things,

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.900 align:middle line:90%

>>BOUTENKO: No, you cannot.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can add
as much or as little,

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.885 align:middle line:84%
as long as it's
ripe and the right--

00:56:55.885 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then if
you taste it and in the end

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.426 align:middle line:84%
you feel like something is
missing, it's not sweet enough,

00:57:00.426 --> 00:57:02.167 align:middle line:84%
you can always fix
it very easily.

00:57:02.167 --> 00:57:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
also add blueberries.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Blueberries are magic.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:09.710 align:middle line:84%
They have phytonutrients in
them that make people alkaline.

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.830 align:middle line:90%
They reverse cancer.

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And they heal-- are very
healing with diabetes.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:16.550 align:middle line:90%
They lower the blood sugar.

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though they are
high in the glycemic index,

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:20.960 align:middle line:90%
they lower blood sugar?

>>BOUTENKO: Yes, because

00:57:22.793 --> 00:57:24.520 align:middle line:90%
of phytonutrients in them.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But don't do you ever
use only blueberries,

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.530 align:middle line:84%
because that will make
a clumpy green smoothie.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.250 align:middle line:84%
There is something in
blueberries that make it clump.

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.646 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I always use
a combination of bananas

00:57:34.646 --> 00:57:37.589 align:middle line:84%

of apples specifically?

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:49.998 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Any apples.

00:57:49.998 --> 00:57:50.810 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Pink lady apples.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:52.559 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Pink ladies, yeah.

00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:53.880 align:middle line:90%
But I also like Fuji.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.999 align:middle line:90%
Any apples are good.

00:57:54.999 --> 00:57:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And I use seeds and
everything in it.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.185 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you use the
core, the seeds, everything.

00:57:58.185 --> 00:57:59.143 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Everything.

00:57:59.143 --> 00:57:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't use that.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.688 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No stems.

00:58:00.688 --> 00:58:01.295 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.295 --> 00:58:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's just wood.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As longs as it's washed.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer organic,
because there's

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.790 align:middle line:90%
a lot of statistics around it.

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:13.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we've
got chard, kale.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:14.610 align:middle line:90%
We've got blueberries.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.020 align:middle line:90%
We've got banana, apples.

>>BOUTENKO: Do you feel like you
need to repeat the ingredients?

00:58:34.689 --> 00:58:36.613 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to repeat
the ingredients of this?

You can also put this
on your skin, right?

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's going to
be sticky, not like avocado.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So OK, so we had
the different chards.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.235 align:middle line:84%
We have kale, spinach,
blueberries, bananas, mangoes.

00:58:58.235 --> 00:58:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: This is
a good consistency.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's beautiful.

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the mango kind of what
binds it all together.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
beginner's smoothie.

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:10.025 align:middle line:84%
So it's supposed to--
supposedly people

00:59:10.025 --> 00:59:11.840 align:middle line:84%
who never tried it
before, not only

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.020 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to be very tasty
and sweet, but-- what is this?

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's fine.

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a
piece of fruit there.

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It's also supposed to
be very, very pretty.

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.950 align:middle line:90%
And we eat with our yes.

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Half of the flavor
comes from the beauty.

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:28.090 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to decorate it.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I'm
going to take this.

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I
usually just want

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.711 align:middle line:84%
to drink it because
it looks so good.

00:59:31.711 --> 00:59:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:35.984 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That's when you are
aware of the goodness in it.

00:59:35.984 --> 00:59:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you really
do put a large emphasis

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.600 align:middle line:84%
on decorating it and
making it beautiful.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, imagine
you make something green,

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:48.340 align:middle line:84%
like this and put it
into the old coffee mug

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.349 align:middle line:84%
says, Daddy loves you and
give it you your child.

00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:53.390 align:middle line:90%
At least you have to do--

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.737 align:middle line:90%


00:59:53.737 --> 00:59:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something aesthetically.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:56.486 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You
turn off the light

00:59:56.486 --> 00:59:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and do a shot in the
dark or something.

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:02.549 align:middle line:84%
So they don't see it's green
and that it's not pretty.

01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to make it pretty.

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
best thing to do is

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to put something pretty,
some pretty green.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:11.640 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I
have oregano here.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can use even the leaf
of the spinach like this.

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:16.617 align:middle line:90%
So whatever you prefer.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whatever you have.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.408 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:00:18.408 --> 01:00:23.047 align:middle line:84%
And then I usually put
some fruit or some berry.

01:00:23.047 --> 01:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And look at
how thick that is.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.054 align:middle line:84%
Because the berry
doesn't even sink.

01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And I also then use, because
it's called Rainbow Smoothie,

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use some rainbow
chard to decorate that.

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:34.479 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:00:34.479 --> 01:00:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And again, you can just--

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Where's
the white one?

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:37.806 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here is the white.

01:00:37.806 --> 01:00:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yup, OK.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:39.895 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Oh, here it is.

01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:40.930 align:middle line:90%
I actually have it here.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.596 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is what
I love about these,

01:00:42.596 --> 01:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is that this all is-- all
those different colors

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.327 align:middle line:84%
represent different vitamins
in the vegetable, right,

01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:48.910 align:middle line:90%
in the greens?

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I'm just going
to put this a rainbow in there.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:52.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, pretty.

01:00:52.395 --> 01:00:53.634 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a great technique.

01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And then--

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.687 align:middle line:90%


01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that's really easy.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
She just put all three of these
together, cut them together,

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and on the knife they make this
beautiful, colorful display.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.444 align:middle line:84%
You can make green
foods so beautiful.

01:01:09.444 --> 01:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And
here, I will just,

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.025 align:middle line:90%
for variety, I put the spinach.

01:01:13.025 --> 01:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%


01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And there you have it.

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:16.540 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Now how easy was that?

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
A green food smoothie
for any beginner.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
It took us under 10 minutes.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably going to
taste as beautiful as it looks.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then
you meet your guest,

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, I have something
special for you.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cheers.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You don't
even say green smoothie.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Say something-- it's a dessert.

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
It is like a dessert, but it's
completely nutritious and not

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
as much sugar as most desserts.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.776 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.776 --> 01:01:44.275 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:01:44.275 --> 01:01:46.298 align:middle line:90%


01:01:46.298 --> 01:01:47.865 align:middle line:90%
That is so good.

01:01:47.865 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And you don't really
taste the greens at all.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:50.718 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:01:50.718 --> 01:01:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The fruit have
the predominant taste.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The fruit dominates
the flavor and the taste.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's green,
it tastes like fruit.

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:59.585 align:middle line:90%
Green smoothie for beginners.

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Mm.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%


01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:04.450 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:11.490 align:middle line:90%


01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're going to
make a coconut green eggnog.

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now this is something that
you can impress your guests

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.990 align:middle line:90%
with during the holidays.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But I love coconut, anything
coconut is my favorite things.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.250 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
What is the properties or
the value of a coconut?

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.504 align:middle line:84%
What nutritional value
does a coconut bring?

01:02:28.504 --> 01:02:31.044 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Coconut water is
the cleanest water in the world.

01:02:31.044 --> 01:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
It's distilled water,
distilled through the plant

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.590 align:middle line:90%
through the palm tree.

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And the coconut has
very good fat in it

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.336 align:middle line:90%
that's very healthy fat.

01:02:40.336 --> 01:02:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Healthy fats.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And so it's purified water.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So you could basically drink
this instead of regular water.

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But it has a lot of rich
enzymes in it, too, doesn't it?

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.943 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's
very rich in enzymes.

01:02:49.943 --> 01:02:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
information sources

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that say that it's been given to
babies when the mother doesn't

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.800 align:middle line:90%
have breast milk.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And they've been also
put intravenously.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, really?

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.448 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Instead of blood.

01:03:02.448 --> 01:03:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know if it's true.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.104 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't know
if it has plasma.

01:03:06.104 --> 01:03:06.603 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge is how to
get into this beautiful--

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's live
water, that's for sure.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a live water.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's a good
way of saying it.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And also this
is the shaved coconut.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It has the husk removed from it.

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people never saw
this kind of coconut.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.860 align:middle line:90%
They only saw the brown one.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The brown ones that
they sell in the store

01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
usually are seven,
eight years old.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
This is like two years old.

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So it's
a young coconut.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So look for the
ones in the market that

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.650 align:middle line:90%
say young coconut.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that in the
tree, you see the brown.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's green.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Green.

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.234 align:middle line:84%
And then when they shave
the green, it's brown.

01:03:35.234 --> 01:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And then under the
brown, there is this.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.358 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually the
brown is inside.

01:03:38.358 --> 01:03:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
green is removed.

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
The brown is still inside.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's because it's young,
it's going to be like yellow.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, all right.

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: OK, let's see.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they can
be intimidating,

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
how to get into them

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.198 align:middle line:90%
without a sledgehammer.

01:03:48.198 --> 01:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a way you can get
into a coconut in two minutes

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:51.200 align:middle line:90%
or less.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, remember
"Cast Away," yeah?

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So first we're going
to remove from the pointy side

01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
some of the husk,
the layer, until we

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
can see the inner husk, the one
that people usually see brown.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:06.492 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, I see.

01:04:06.492 --> 01:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lot
softer than I thought.

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.830 align:middle line:90%
This is very soft.

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:11.189 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

01:04:11.189 --> 01:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's like a sponge.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.352 align:middle line:90%


01:04:13.352 --> 01:04:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Spongy, yeah, uh-huh.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I think
it protects it

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
from falling-- when it
falls, from cracking.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you can start to
see the center of the coconut,

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:24.100 align:middle line:90%
if you can see the middle there.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So when the
coconut is very old,

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
like seven years old,
this falls apart.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then people see that old
husk in there, the brown one.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when you open,
clear this much of this,

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
then you need to make a crack.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the coconut
has a structure

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.290 align:middle line:90%
of circular structure.

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And so if I put
the knife in here,

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
then it will crack open
circular, like a round,

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:55.130 align:middle line:90%
like a circle.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So it looks dangerous,
but it's really not.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm pushing
with my arm and that.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's very easy.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It went in very easily.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and there comes
the coconut juice.

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.181 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then
I just make it bigger.

01:05:07.181 --> 01:05:08.797 align:middle line:90%
And then I kind of twist it.

01:05:08.797 --> 01:05:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the juice comes out.

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you twist it.

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of are
leveraging it a little bit.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%


01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.365 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, it opened perfectly.

01:05:16.365 --> 01:05:17.442 align:middle line:90%


01:05:17.442 --> 01:05:18.150 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Just like a lid,
right like that.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.124 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that was really easy.

01:05:24.124 --> 01:05:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:27.645 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to pour
it in here so everybody

01:05:27.645 --> 01:05:28.770 align:middle line:90%
can see what it looks like.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think that
was under a minute.

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's a very, very
good coconut, very healthy.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:34.295 align:middle line:90%
So the water is very clear.

01:05:34.295 --> 01:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look at that.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:36.586 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: If the
coconut is old,

01:05:36.586 --> 01:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
then the water could be pink.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And then I usually discard that.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it's
got fungus in it.

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.861 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then when you
said that the brown coconuts,

01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the older coconuts, those are
the ones that you definitely

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.260 align:middle line:90%
don't want to drink, right?

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: No, you
don't want to drink them.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.990 align:middle line:84%
They usually are
without water already.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
They just have the husk that's
very old and sometimes rancid.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to know if the
coconut is good, you shake it,

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and you shouldn't
hear the water, right?

01:05:58.570 --> 01:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You
shouldn't hear the water.

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.972 align:middle line:84%
That means you
don't have any air.

01:06:00.972 --> 01:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and
when the air comes,

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
that means that it's
fermented and creates--

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:07.905 align:middle line:84%
so if you hear the water,
not a good coconut.

01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.066 align:middle line:90%
So could start getting this--

01:06:11.066 --> 01:06:12.065 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Taking that out?

01:06:12.065 --> 01:06:12.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And actually,
I'll show you the trick.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.768 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to do
it with the spatula.

01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:16.930 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
You just stick the
spatula in between.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.336 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness,
that is so easy.

01:06:20.336 --> 01:06:21.169 align:middle line:90%


01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if any of you
have had the experience I've

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.220 align:middle line:84%
had with coconuts, but
it's flown off the counter.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had sledge
hammers in the yard.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the easiest I've
ever seen a coconut open.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.640 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%


01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And the meat of the
coconut-- again,

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
you can do so much with it.

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
It's got all of the
vital nutrients, enzymes.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%


01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It is another very perfect food.

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And so then
we just get it in there.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.045 align:middle line:90%


01:06:50.045 --> 01:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
is what is going

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.539 align:middle line:84%
to give it that milky,
creamy consistency.

01:06:53.539 --> 01:06:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Eggnog.

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The eggnog-like
consistency.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:57.808 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Of course we
want everything green.

01:06:57.808 --> 01:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a green age, so
we make eggnog green, too,

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
like "Green Eggs
and Ham," you know?

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.537 align:middle line:90%


01:07:02.537 --> 01:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well again,
the green is going

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to counter balance the sugar
found in the coconut, right?

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:11.684 align:middle line:90%
Let me see that for a second.

01:07:11.684 --> 01:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can see inside here,

01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:17.559 align:middle line:84%
but she cleaned it out, and it
came apart very, very nicely.

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:18.100 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.452 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I'm going to
put this water back in here.

01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to do the same

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.371 align:middle line:84%
with the second
one, second coconut.

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:26.340 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.484 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a
two-coconut recipe.

01:07:28.484 --> 01:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:31.120 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So again,
we find the pointy part.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You won't find any here, so.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:36.660 align:middle line:90%


01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And shave it.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.250 align:middle line:90%


01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:42.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And then again, this
part of the coconut

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
is something that
you won't find.

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Keep your
fingers away from my knife.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I'll keep my
fingers out of the way.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:49.469 align:middle line:90%


01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have young
children, make sure

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:52.426 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
this supervised.

01:07:52.426 --> 01:07:53.350 align:middle line:90%


01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful part about
the coconut inside,

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:59.564 align:middle line:84%
this part right
here, you know when

01:07:59.564 --> 01:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about having
the brown fur on the outside

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of the coconut, the kind
of hairy consistency?

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: That's what it is.

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:07.181 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what that
usually-- but when it's older,

01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:09.186 align:middle line:90%
it's-- all right, shake it?

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Perfect.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.296 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, perfect.

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:11.844 align:middle line:90%


01:08:11.844 --> 01:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You cannot hear
the water, so it's good.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, you just put a
very sharp knife in there

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and hold it very tight.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.910 align:middle line:90%
This I hold tight.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:22.389 align:middle line:90%
You cannot really move it.

01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:22.889 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%


01:08:24.610 --> 01:08:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it-- and
this part amazes me.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It just opens up,
pops off like a top.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a lid.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.189 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll take the
meat out of that one.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:37.395 align:middle line:90%


01:08:37.395 --> 01:08:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.160 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.493 align:middle line:84%
You could do it, even you do
it first time in your life.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:42.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the meat
out of this one

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.016 align:middle line:84%
while you're working
on the dates.

01:08:45.016 --> 01:08:47.335 align:middle line:90%


01:08:47.335 --> 01:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.147 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

01:08:50.147 --> 01:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
You taught me how.

01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:52.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now the next thing--

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Keep going around.

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:54.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, I'll keep on this.

01:08:54.659 --> 01:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
So now the next thing is dates.

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.069 align:middle line:90%


01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We're
going to add six dates.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't want pits in there.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Pits could break your blender.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.544 align:middle line:90%
And they will not blend.

01:09:04.544 --> 01:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're very strong.

01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They're
very, very strong.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.819 align:middle line:90%
They're very protective.

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So I just cut them along
and then open like this

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and put the pit somewhere.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Then throw
the date in there.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Make sure
you remove, although,

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:18.514 align:middle line:90%
this little husk on it.

01:09:18.514 --> 01:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the end as well.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.617 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
blend very well.

01:09:21.617 --> 01:09:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No, it's very woody.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.039 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to put six.

01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:26.511 align:middle line:90%
I have to have 6 pits out there.

01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is something
that you can use for a dessert.

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.196 align:middle line:90%
You can use it for--

01:09:32.196 --> 01:09:33.279 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It is dessert.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:33.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is dessert.

01:09:33.845 --> 01:09:35.261 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It is
a dessert, yeah.

01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It is a wonderful,
festive dessert.

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:44.141 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Put this on a platter
with glasses of green coconut

01:09:44.141 --> 01:09:44.640 align:middle line:90%
smoothies.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.765 align:middle line:90%
It would just be beautiful.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%


01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And it's so tasty.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to put a sign on it,
don't drink it before dinner.

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah,
you'll be full, right?

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
it will disappear.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I prepare one
for shows or anything,

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I have to put the sign, because
it disappears from my fridge.

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.150 align:middle line:90%


01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because your
whole family eats it.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's
just-- it's very tasty.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.939 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: OK, you done?

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.579 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do as good
a job as you did.

01:10:12.579 --> 01:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well,
after two coconuts,

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.427 align:middle line:90%
you'll be much professional.

01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I need a little
more experience there.

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:18.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And then to-- now if
this isn't sweet enough,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to add a
little bit of cinnamon

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit of nutmeg.

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We're going
to add bananas to it.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, add bananas as well.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between these bananas here?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.141 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, I don't
want to use these ones.

01:10:32.141 --> 01:10:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Even though they look pretty.

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Because I want the ripest.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%
As ripe as possible.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So even
the stem here shows

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's not ripe
enough for you to use.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's not ripe, no.

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Just pull it over there.

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:45.880 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.157 align:middle line:90%
But that's good to see.

01:10:47.157 --> 01:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really good
for people to understand.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Even though these have
a few blemishes on them,

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that means that they're ripe,
and they're not too ripe,

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:55.600 align:middle line:90%
though.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: No, they're
not, because they're not

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.240 align:middle line:90%
totally brown.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that when the-- from
my experience, when they ripe

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
correctly, when they're
picked up pretty ripe,

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:05.020 align:middle line:90%
they will have dots.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
If they've been
picked up very green,

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:08.845 align:middle line:84%
they will instead
have black lines.

01:11:08.845 --> 01:11:10.190 align:middle line:90%


01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so if they've been
picked before they're ready,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:13.750 align:middle line:90%
they'll have the black lines.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They're always
picked for us in Oregon,

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.183 align:middle line:84%
they always pick
before they're ready.

01:11:17.183 --> 01:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But when they have
dots, that means

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.860 align:middle line:90%
they were not totally green.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.705 align:middle line:84%
They were somewhat
beginning to ripe.

01:11:22.705 --> 01:11:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You always choose
the ones with the dots.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With the dots on them.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Rather
than just blemishes.

01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:29.414 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
inside, does it matter

01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:30.850 align:middle line:90%
if they're bruised inside?

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, if they're
really bruised and brown,

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I cut this out.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.778 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You cut
the brown part out.

01:11:34.778 --> 01:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.682 align:middle line:90%


01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:38.390 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:42.649 align:middle line:84%
And now, the reason
that you use the banana?

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Just to make it
sweet, because it's eggnog.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.847 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's already so
sweet with everything else

01:11:47.847 --> 01:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.064 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Oh,
not for children.

01:11:50.064 --> 01:11:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:52.088 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Children
like it sweet.

01:11:52.088 --> 01:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They like--
and the dates

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:55.070 align:middle line:90%
make it very sweet as well.

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Now why don't you
use date paste?

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.800 align:middle line:90%
You used a full date?

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I always like to
see what I put in my food.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You like the whole food.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:06.306 align:middle line:84%
Now, how would you
make this a pudding.

01:17:06.306 --> 01:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: This is
actually a pudding.

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is a pudding.

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:08.935 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:08.935 --> 01:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
if I add more water,

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.161 align:middle line:90%
then you can drink it.

01:17:11.161 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Without
water, it's a pudding.

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can make
it smoother or make it--

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We both have
strong lungs, so we'll--

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cheers.

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:17.280 align:middle line:90%
To your health.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.144 align:middle line:90%


01:17:19.144 --> 01:17:20.043 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:17:20.043 --> 01:17:20.542 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:21.940 align:middle line:90%


01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.512 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: This is to live for.

01:17:23.512 --> 01:17:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing!

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.490 align:middle line:90%
To live for, I love it.

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.147 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

01:17:28.147 --> 01:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Any children around?

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.396 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, any-- yes.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:34.474 align:middle line:84%
Any child I guarantee you
would love, love this.

01:17:34.474 --> 01:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And it
doesn't green at all.

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
taste like green at all.

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It's better than
chocolate, actually.

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.555 align:middle line:84%
This is really, really
amazing, trust me.

01:17:43.555 --> 01:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Don't trust us.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Try it and you will
see how good it is.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Try it yourself.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.360 align:middle line:90%


01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.405 align:middle line:84%
This is the Coconut
Green Eggnog.

01:17:50.405 --> 01:18:00.005 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.005 --> 01:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
This next one
we're going to make

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
is a Rainbow Green Smoothie.

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
This again is going to be
the infusion between fruits

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and your greens.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to fruits
and vegetables, which

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
tend to be more starchy,
these are, of course,

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:13.265 align:middle line:90%
the green nutrients.

01:18:13.265 --> 01:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes, that's it.

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:14.459 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:16.347 align:middle line:90%
So how do we make this one?

01:18:16.347 --> 01:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: We start with water.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So we see how much we add.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
add about two cups.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the water
doesn't dilute the enzymes

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.390 align:middle line:90%
from the fruits, right?

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.036 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Absolutely not.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It adds to the
consistency, right?

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
It makes it a little
bit more fluid.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.467 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, without
water, you cannot blend.

01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard that, and
I tried it before with just

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.360 align:middle line:90%
the fruit--

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Or if you
have a high-speed blender,

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
you can use the plunger and
you do it without water.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.025 align:middle line:90%
And that will be a pudding.

01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More of a pudding, OK.

01:18:44.275 --> 01:18:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
This is more practical
because it's easy.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's fast.

01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:50.792 align:middle line:84%
You can do it on the way to
work and at home in the morning.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you can drink it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It takes under three
minutes, including cleaning.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:57.521 align:middle line:84%
And now, OK, starting
off with strawberries.

01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
This is good for summer.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.228 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:18:59.228 --> 01:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, summer and also some
people like it slightly chilled.

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:06.795 align:middle line:84%
All right, it will be kind
of acting as your ice.

01:19:06.795 --> 01:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, after you do-- you
make a smoothie like this,

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.559 align:middle line:84%
how long does it
last, the smoothie?

01:19:11.559 --> 01:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
smoothie will last up

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.250 align:middle line:90%
to three days in the fridge.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.374 align:middle line:90%
And it will still be green.

01:19:15.374 --> 01:19:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Of course, fresh is better.

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.108 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's-- that's--
having the green in it makes it

01:19:19.108 --> 01:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
last longer than if
it was just fruit?

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Not necessarily
the green, the fiber.

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The insoluble fiber
prevents it from spoiling.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.015 align:middle line:84%
Because the fiber has all
the antioxidants in it.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.515 align:middle line:84%
But for example
when you make juice,

01:19:31.515 --> 01:19:32.797 align:middle line:90%
it becomes brown instantly.

01:19:32.797 --> 01:19:34.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to drink it right away.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It becomes
brown and bitter.

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:38.428 align:middle line:84%
But when you make smoothie, it
stays brilliant green color,

01:19:38.428 --> 01:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
or the same color
what you make it.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.375 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because of the
fiber in the leaves?

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
of the fiber in it.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.429 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, I see.

01:19:43.429 --> 01:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The antioxidants
are in the fiber.

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they kind of
work as a preservative.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, antioxidants.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: OK.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.430 align:middle line:84%
If you throw the fiber in
the-- the pulp in the compost,

01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
then you have just
juice unprotected.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:59.700 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot more sense.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.615 align:middle line:90%
OK, so--

01:20:00.615 --> 01:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So that's why you
can make for the whole day.

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I like that these
leaves are big,

01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I put in
the recipe only two leaves.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Because they're huge.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.052 align:middle line:84%
This one leaf is like
many leaves of spinach.

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then this
is a rainbow chard.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And you say we should not have
the stems in this partic--

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.630 align:middle line:90%
when you use rainbow chard.

01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: When I use the
chard or collard or kale,

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I remove stems.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I put them later in
something else, in a salad.

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.419 align:middle line:90%
Because they're not green.

01:20:25.419 --> 01:20:26.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't provide chlorophyll.

01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:28.894 align:middle line:84%
And they give peppery taste
that is not very nice.

01:20:28.894 --> 01:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, do you
want yellow or white?

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I want yellow, too.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yellow also, OK.

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:33.358 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

01:20:33.358 --> 01:20:33.375 align:middle line:90%


01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't have
to necessarily cut it.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
You could just tear
the leaves off, right?

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: You can, yes.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.190 align:middle line:90%


01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's just faster.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you were to put
this type of thing in water,

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
would it turn the water red?

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Pink, yes.

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A pinkish color?

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or yellow?

01:20:47.770 --> 01:20:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's really neat.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That's how
ancient Greeks used

01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to make their green
smoothie without blender.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
They would cut the
green leaves, and they

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.944 align:middle line:84%
would put them in water
and let it sit for an hour.

01:20:57.944 --> 01:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there will be
green-- slightly green water,

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.554 align:middle line:90%
and then they'll drink it.

01:21:01.554 --> 01:21:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So it really takes
it-- that's great.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: OK, so
we're going to--

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and I will add
these bananas, too.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because this
has, of course, been around

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten so far away
from these types of foods.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is so easy
to make something

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.910 align:middle line:90%
that is so completely filling.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.972 align:middle line:84%
After something like
this, you're not hungry.

01:21:23.972 --> 01:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, my
four-year-old Lilly,

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
granddaughter, she
always peels the banana.

01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
This is her work.

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:29.671 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is her work.

01:21:29.671 --> 01:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: In our family,
she peels the bananas.

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:35.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so the
bananas, again, and I've

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
mentioned this several
times, but the greens

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
counteract the sugars,
the high sugars.

So these are OK for diabetics.

01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, yes.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And especially for
diabetics, because my son

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with
diabetes when he was 9.

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.765 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have
diabetes anymore.

01:21:48.765 --> 01:21:50.750 align:middle line:90%


01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He loved, intuitively
loved, mangoes.

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
He could eat mangoes
all the time.

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned
from Dr, Bernard Jensen

01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that mangoes have properties in
them that actually good for--

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
to restore the pancreas.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.330 align:middle line:90%


01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you can
use a peel in mango,

01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:08.755 align:middle line:84%
but mango comes from
the poison oak family.

01:22:08.755 --> 01:22:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does?

01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It does.

01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And especially in
the spring and fall

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
when the season of allergies,
I prefer to peel it,

01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
just because it accumulates.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while, I put
peel when it's organic,

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.315 align:middle line:90%
but in most cases, I peel this.

01:22:22.315 --> 01:22:23.410 align:middle line:90%


01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:26.224 align:middle line:84%
So the skin has vitamins
in it as well, but--

01:22:26.224 --> 01:22:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:28.420 align:middle line:90%


01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This would be
good for decoration.

01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%

01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
decoration for later.

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.862 align:middle line:90%
We can wrap it around the glass.

01:22:36.862 --> 01:22:38.524 align:middle line:90%
You're teaching me well.

01:22:38.524 --> 01:22:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Thank you.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so
much that you can

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
do with just these
simple things.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that, again, you

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
don't have to-- don't throw it
in the trash, compost this so

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:52.035 align:middle line:84%
that it can become
an organic substance.

01:22:52.035 --> 01:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's a sin to
throw organic in the plastic.

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:57.595 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good to teach
children under the age of 6

01:22:57.595 --> 01:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to peel fruit,
apples and mangoes.

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Teach them, meaning
the technique of it?

01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: With a knife,
because if they don't learn it

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.766 align:middle line:84%
under the six, they will
be always kind of hard.

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:09.990 align:middle line:90%

the way to do it?

01:23:11.531 --> 01:23:12.964 align:middle line:90%
You move towards your thumb?

01:23:12.964 --> 01:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Also you can take and
do this type of action when

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching young children
so that they're moving away

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.210 align:middle line:90%

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, this kind
of gives us peace of mind.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.485 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
really teach them.

01:23:26.485 --> 01:23:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't, really?

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.694 align:middle line:90%


01:23:28.694 --> 01:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
always taught, really.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That's why we
have so many people who

01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
peel the apple.

01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we're all
being taught like this?

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:34.886 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I ask people at
this marketplace,

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:38.294 align:middle line:90%
why don't they buy mangoes?

01:23:38.294 --> 01:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
They say because we don't
know how to peel it.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.112 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

01:23:41.112 --> 01:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it does
make a big difference

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
when they're ripe like this,
because it's a lot easier

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:45.680 align:middle line:90%
to move.

>>LISA: Now, what
gives you the energy?

01:24:24.905 --> 01:24:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it the sugar in the fruits?

01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the--

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The energy
you get both from ripe,

01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:31.989 align:middle line:90%
organic fruit and from--

01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The vitality
from the greens.

01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:34.738 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: From chlorophyll.

01:24:34.738 --> 01:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because chlorophyll
is liquefied sunshine.

01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.807 align:middle line:84%
And sunlight is the
source of-- main source

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:39.640 align:middle line:90%
of energy on planet.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.750 align:middle line:90%


01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
All carbohydrates
actually come from sun

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.642 align:middle line:90%
through the photosynthesis.

01:24:46.642 --> 01:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the molecule
of chlorophyll

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is the base of any
molecule of sugar.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now,
when you add fruits

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:55.986 align:middle line:84%

sugar in them, does

01:24:55.986 --> 01:24:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that make a difference
in the smoothie?

01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you add more

01:25:02.344 --> 01:25:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:06.120 align:middle line:84%
When it's sweeter fruit, I
could put more greens in it.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I would-- usually
for the beginners,

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I use 60% fruit, 40%
greens volume-wise.

>>LISA: So you don't
crave as much sugar.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, but
if you've been drinking

I'm just kind of
playing with that.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I use an apple.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I just
like the red apple.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll help.

01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:44.932 align:middle line:84%
Look, I'm starting
to get creative now.

01:26:44.932 --> 01:26:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Good.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There we go.

01:26:46.473 --> 01:26:47.570 align:middle line:90%


01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Like you did earlier.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I just sunk the strawberry.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:50.950 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:51.866 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: That's OK.

01:26:51.866 --> 01:26:52.597 align:middle line:90%


01:26:52.597 --> 01:26:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There we go.

01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:55.470 align:middle line:90%


01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I think maybe we
could do something like that.

01:26:58.650 --> 01:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%


01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yours probably
looks better than mine.

01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Hey, this is fun.

01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:06.856 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
can experiment.

01:27:06.856 --> 01:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Or you could go like
this, just like it

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.952 align:middle line:90%
was a-- is that all right?

01:27:09.952 --> 01:27:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Absolutely.

01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Anything is all right.

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And when children participate,
then they cannot say that

01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:16.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not tasty, because
it's part of them.

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you really can't go
wrong with something like this.

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No, no, no.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.341 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't have to
follow an exact recipe,

01:27:21.341 --> 01:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
huge recipe follower.

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
For those that are, they
can follow the recipe

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and be just fine.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And you can make
it like more three dimensional.

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.560 align:middle line:90%


01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.910 align:middle line:90%
That is beautiful.

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
That is art right
there, art in a glass.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Art and health in a glass.

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely beautiful.

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Cheers to your health.
