00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: It seems
our world is speeding up

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
with the rapid increase
of technological advances.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there's a yearning

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
for deep meaning, connection,
and a heart-centered world.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:10%
And joining me is the
Executive Vice President

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:10%
of the HeartMath Institute,
Howard Martin who

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:10%
has spent the last
few decades sharing

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:10%
his proven and transformative
message that our hearts hold

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:10%
a superior intelligence
that connects us all.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So tell me, since
we've last spoken,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:90%
our world is a different place.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD MARTIN: Yeah, it's
changing fast, isn't it?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more chaos.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more crisis.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:10%
Speed of change is
accelerating, you know.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.225 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to get any
slower anytime soon either.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
We're going through an
unprecedented amount change.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
More change happening
in less time than ever

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
before in the
history of humankind.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Now it's not a bad thing.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly
stirring up a lot.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And we see the world's
problems on full display.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We see the chaos, the confusion,
all the social inequities,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
all the suffering.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It's on full display.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And because of technology,
we're more aware of it than ever

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We are
more aware of it.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's challenging
enough to be

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
able to try to deal
with what we're seeing.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:10%
There's good news
in this, though.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:10%
The spirit of humanity is
rising to the occasion.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And we are ushering in
a new and very different

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:10%
world right in the
midst of the old one.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:10%
So I think that is an
interesting time to be alive.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:10%
It's certainly a
challenging time,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:10%
but also very opportunistic.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to change, to grow,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference, more
than ever before, really.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is such--

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:90%
there is like opposing forces.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You would feel there's
this amazing good

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and the technology of
that HeartMath brings.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But there is also an equal
amount of disruption and lack

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.179 align:middle line:90%
of morality and change.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You have old
ways of doing things

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:90%
that are very entrenched.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And they're not all bad.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean the societies
evolved and they have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%
produced some amazing things.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
But you have the old.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You have the new-- new ways of
thinking, new ways of doing.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:90%
They come together.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Where the old meets the
new, there's friction.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.882 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
see on the news.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.688 align:middle line:84%
That is a lot of what
we're seeing on the news.

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's so
much disruption and chaos.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And we're also divided.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
We're not together in
a one coherent state

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.707 align:middle line:84%
really, if you look at
our political systems

00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and so forth in the world.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But you're attempting to
do something different.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Separation is definitely a part
of the challenge that we face,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but also I see that
there's another larger

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
energetic momentum going on
as well of coming together,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.827 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation.

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.035 align:middle line:90%
You see it maybe in business.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.794 align:middle line:84%
There's a term now called
coopetition, for example.

00:02:53.794 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Of rather than competing
with everybody,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
let's figure a way
we can work together

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.569 align:middle line:90%
to make it better for everyone.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:90%
That's just one little example.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But I see that the spirit of
cooperation, actually, coming

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
in to the middle
of the separation

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and the polarization that
seems so prevalent today.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coopetition.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
It's how we work, really
how nature works together.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: To me, it's part of
an evolution that's taking place

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
where a new world
is birthing itself

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
right in the midst of the one
that we have been existing

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.922 align:middle line:90%
in for a very long time.

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:90%
That's hard for people.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But super fast.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Super fast.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a little window of time
when it's all happening very,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And people are having
a difficult time

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
with that very often,
both in terms of what

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
they feel personally inside
themselves, interpersonally,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
societally, globally,
all of that.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't think we
have really the tools that we

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
have developed over
time to handle the pace

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:90%
that we're at right now.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.731 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, we
do have something.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.658 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We have this
magnificent intelligence

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that can and does lift
us beyond our problems,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.185 align:middle line:84%
even in the midst of
the chaos and confusion.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that's been talked

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:90%
about for thousands of years.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And what it's called is heart.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And when heart is brought out of
just the realms of spirituality

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy and then put
it into practical application

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
in a daily life where
it's needed the most,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
we can experience
a new existence,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a new life, a new
sense of fulfillment

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that can really exceed even
our greatest expectations.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you've spent
your greater part of your life

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
researching this, developing
this, and really looking

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:90%
at the science behind it.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have done this
through science technology

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.334 align:middle line:84%
and through something
that you call Add Heart.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little about that.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:10%
First of all, at HeartMath one
of the things that we did early

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:10%
on when HeartMath
was actually created,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:10%
now 28 years ago,
it was recognized

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:10%
we had to build a bridge between
what people thought about heart

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:10%
and would have been
written about it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:10%
and said for thousands of
years and this daily living.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
How could this be applied
in mainstream ways

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
so that it could have impact on
individual and societal ways?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
That bridge we chose was
the bridge of science.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did people
think about heart?

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, they
saw it as sweet.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.254 align:middle line:90%
They saw it as sentimental.

00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:10%
They saw it as a
nice thing to have,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:10%
but not necessarily something
that played out in what

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:10%
they were doing in their lives.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Terms like you don't
bring heart into business

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:10%
or those kinds of terminologies
were quite prevalent.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was a
longing for more heart.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think people want
to feel love and feel cared for.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:90%
They want to feel kindness.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
All these aspects of humankind
were sort of in conflict

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
with societal programming
about what heart is.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we needed to
straighten that out

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
or do what we could do to build
that bridge between the two.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And science is what we chose.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
chose science is

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
because in modern
society when something

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
is proven through empirical
scientific research,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
it becomes more believable.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We believe what
science says to us.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So we set about trying
to show that what

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
had been said about heart
for thousands of years

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.979 align:middle line:84%
was actually true through
a scientific lens.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've seen the
movies that it's all

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
been about love and
romance, but you're actually

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.365 align:middle line:84%
able to attach science
to that feeling?

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: In a sense, yeah.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
What we're able to show is
that there is an intelligence

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not just based
upon the brain

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and the logical, linear
intelligence, which

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
are obviously important.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's another bandwidth,
so to speak, of intelligence

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
that we access.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
It's more intuitive in nature.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
It's more high speed.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:90%
It looks out for the whole.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And it really brings us more
into contact with who we truly

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:90%
are, our authentic self.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
started to do science,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
we realized, OK, we have to
look at the physical heart.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
What's it doing?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Is it just pumping blood?

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.265 align:middle line:84%
And what we found was that
there was a story scattered

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
throughout the research
literature in little pieces

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.889 align:middle line:84%
showing that the
heart was certainly

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
doing more than pumping blood.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So our scientific team,
doing their own research

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and then borrowing from the
little pieces of research,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
were able to clearly show
that the physical heart is

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
an information processing
center in our bodies.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How is that determined?

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, you
determine it looking at ways

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:90%
in which it communicates.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, most
people don't know this,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
but the heart has
a nervous system.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Next to the brain, it's
the most complex part

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous
system that we have.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It's actually studied through
a field called neurocardiology.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
But I call these
things who knew?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Who knew this was
actually happening?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And it communicates
for the brain

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
through a nerve pathway
that starts in the heart.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And that nerve pathway
goes all the way

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to the higher perceptual
centers of the brain.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And when scientists look
at the neurological traffic

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
in the body, they
can clearly see

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.997 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is sending a lot
more information to the brain

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:90%
than it ever gets from it.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.814 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
starts in the heart

00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and sends the
signal to the brain.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: To the brain.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And brain function is
critically dependent

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.324 align:middle line:90%
upon this information.

00:07:44.324 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And so there are other ways.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
There's hormonal communication.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:90%
This is another who new.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
The heart produces
a lot of hormones.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.622 align:middle line:84%
There's a blood pressure way
of communication, biophysical.

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the one that's
most interesting to me,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
the one that's coolest, I think
is the energetic communication.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Your heart produces an
electromagnetic field.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Surrounds each and every
one of us in 360 degrees.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And extends outside of our
body about three to four feet.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So our fields right
now, yours and mine

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
are like we're communicating.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not an aura or subtle
energy I'm talking about.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It's very measurable,
electromagnetic energy.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
fascinating, especially

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
if you were to look at
it through something

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that measures that,
you'd see a field that

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
is crossing between us.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that field then
goes out way beyond us.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It does.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.689 align:middle line:84%
And that field, we
encode that field.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies in the field
are changing all the time.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:90%
And we are encoding it.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.959 align:middle line:90%
And here's how.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%
We do it through our emotions.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
What we're feeling
is actually being

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:90%
broadcast through that field.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.464 align:middle line:84%
We're imprinting that field
with our emotional state.

00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we're feeling really
good, like we are right now you

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and I having a good
time being together here

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
at Gaia doing an interview,
that's transmitting.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.061 align:middle line:84%
If we were to feel angry
or frustrated or irritated,

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
it's imprinting the
field with that.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.789 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So the field
is always changing.

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you brought
up a good question.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
conservative measurement

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of an electromagnetic field.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But what if we begin to
think about these fields

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of, let's
say, quantum physics, which

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.269 align:middle line:84%
removes the barriers of time
and space as we know them?

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So where does this heart
field really connect to?

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.307 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And what does it
really connect us to?

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
These are interesting
questions that we are exploring

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.756 align:middle line:90%
through our research today.

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
research is amazing.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's a photo you have
here of the electrophysiology

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
of intuition.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the aspects of
what we call heart intelligence

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is a heightened
sense of intuition.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.683 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Let me just speak
a little to intuition.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe intuition is really
like a field of information

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:90%
that's always there.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that the coding?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.401 align:middle line:84%
It's more like just
this information.

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:84%
We draw in information from
what we can call consciousness.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And we turn that into what
we see as our reality.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And we make choices
from that information.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
To me, intuition is part of
that field of consciousness.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.964 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's like we see
it as ahas and insights.

00:10:05.964 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's really something
that's always there.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.756 align:middle line:84%
And we sort of tune into it or
tune out of it all the time.

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So our researchers
wanted to know

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
was there anything
physiologically

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
happening when we were, saying,
having an intuitive experience?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So they did a very
complex study published

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:84%
in the "Journal of Alternative
and Complementary Medicine."

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, there
are over 300 peer

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:10%
reviewed, published research
studies done by HeartMath.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:90%
So lots of research.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
This one was particularly
interesting to me.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They had test subjects
who were sitting

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:90%
in front of the computer.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:10%
And they were taking a variety
of biological measurements

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously at
the same time--

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:10%
brainwave activity, lots
of heart function activity,

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:10%
skin response activity, lots of
physiological data going back.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
They were sitting in front of
a computer loaded with images.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They had been
carefully selected.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of the images
were horrific.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Someone being stabbed or a
snake jumping out at you.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
The other images were very
emotionally evocative,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
rainbows, and bunny rabbits
and things like that.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The computer was set
on random selection.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't programmed.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It was randomly selected.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do
is that an instruction

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
would come on the computer
to push the button.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:90%
They push a button.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Screen would stay
blank for six seconds.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.219 align:middle line:90%
Then the picture emerged.

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Then the screen
would go blank again.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
The picture would stay on
screen for three seconds.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was repeated over
and over and over again.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they
analyzed the data--

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
this was really interesting--

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
They found that in
many, many cases,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
the physiological response
to the upcoming picture

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was actually happening six
seconds before the picture was

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Preemptively.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Preemptively.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
The body was doing what it would
do if the picture was there.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't there yet.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.112 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How does that happen?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They continued
an analysis of that.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.491 align:middle line:84%
And they started looking at the
information traffic occurring

00:11:57.491 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in the body during
this those periods.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
They found that the first
part of our physiology

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to respond to the picture that
wasn't there was the heart.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
A second and a half
later, the brain

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.681 align:middle line:84%
responded accordingly to
what the picture should be.

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And a second and a
half before the picture

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
emerged, brain and heart coupled
together at a frequency level.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And then there was a picture.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence was heart,
brain, heart brain together,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so then we use this
in our lives all of the time.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean as a mother
I can feel parts

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on with
my daughter with her not

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:90%
even being around.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But can we feel that as
a collective society?

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Where we are--
we're aware of war.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
We're aware of
turmoil happening.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that
constantly harbor us?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It does.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.615 align:middle line:84%
But let me, if I may, come
in on a point you just made.

00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
When we think about intuition
at HeartMath-- and we

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
have modules in our
training programs

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.579 align:middle line:84%
on what we call
practical intuition.

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Because we see it as practical.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to be
looked as mystical.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And you brought up a great
point that I sometimes

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:84%
use as an analogy for that
and it's being a mother.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Parenting is such an
intuitive process.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.346 align:middle line:84%
How do you know what
that child needs?

00:13:14.346 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you communicate
with that child?

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:90%
How do you sense?

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you sense that,
very poignantly,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
through love, through
the love that you

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
have with the child and the
love the child has for you.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
you access an intuition,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
a form of practical
intuition, that allows

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
you to be a really good parent.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way I see.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It happens with
partners as well and siblings

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever there's
a love connection,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
a relationship like that.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there is societal
intuition where we're sensing

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:90%
similar things as a society.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Unknowingly, but behaviors
change in mass a lot of times

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:84%
We're actually tuning
into the same frequency.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And society goes
through a transition.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is an
intuitional component that

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
comes along with that.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now I can
see that with love.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that with
a familial relationship.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But back to the
question about when

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
there are harmful things
being done to our planet

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
or to our ecosystem or
to human trafficking,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean when we know stuff
like that is happening,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:90%
what do we shut that off?

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean aren't we
constantly-- we can't

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
decipher the love
versus the hate, can we?

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It is a problem that
people face today.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And it can be an
overload on the emotions

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
when you see all the
many problems that

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:90%
are on full display today.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And you just listed a few
that are pretty tough, right?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And that can sort of
bring our feeling down.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And in our own inner
vibrations, so to speak,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
can get lowered as we begin
to look at all these world

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
events and situations
that people go through.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
it is that it actually

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
starts out with feelings
of compassion and care.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
We see this and
we have compassion

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
for people that are exposed to
things like human trafficking

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
or war, the refugee crisis,
and all the list of things

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:90%
that are going on there.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
over time is that we

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
lose a certain connection to
the true compassion and care.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes
something like sympathy

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or the draining kind of
care that we call overcare

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.482 align:middle line:90%
at HeartMath.

00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the challenge
we all face today is how do we

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
maintain a certain
uplifting pitch

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
or vibration in our
perspective of the world

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and at the same
time not ignore it?

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's not
about shutting off.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now, here's
one thing that I do.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It may be useful
for people to know.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't
shut the news off.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I do look at what's
going on in the news.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But let's say I'm
looking at, let's say,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the CNN site or
something on my phone.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time I
don't read the articles.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:90%
I simply look at the headline.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The headline can
keep me informed so

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that I can stay connected to the
world and have the compassion.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
If I start reading the
stories, I get into the drama.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I get into all the news.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And then my feelings
begin to shift.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the judgments
come in of like I can't

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:90%
believe they're doing that.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe
this is happening.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.601 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
catch myself from that,

00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that having
some concern is not bad.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But if it goes into the
judgments and the anger and all

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that, then I'm
losing my connection

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.544 align:middle line:84%
to the true compassion that
that situation probably needs.

00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do the same thing.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I look at the headlines.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.674 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of read them
intuitively, so to speak.

00:16:34.674 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned something
called overcare.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:90%
What is overcare?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Overcare is when
your original care takes

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
on the characteristics of
an overburdensome sense

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
of responsibility.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, leading to illness.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.868 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And leading
to a lot of things.

00:16:48.868 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And so overcare is a state
that exist in the world.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just ubiquitous.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't even notice it.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like the air we breathe.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't see it.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And overcare is that way.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And it has many different forms.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.149 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about that
in the first book

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that I authored with Doc
Childre, "HeartMath Solution,"

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
we had a whole
chapter on overcare.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about the sons
and daughters of overcare.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
Things like perfectionism
would be a form of overcare.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
We really have to get
everything right or we're bad.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:90%
We're wrong.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or we're out of control.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Talk about
overcare like care

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
itself is one of the most
beautiful things we experience

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Caring for someone feels
good and receiving true care

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:90%
from another feels good.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Overcare is when that
care feels draining.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And when overcare is
being focused on you,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
it's not comfortable.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Like the overcaring mother
or the overcaring person

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that is constantly
worrying about that.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Never really feels great.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:84%
You can learn, however,
to bring yourself back

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to the original care.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.744 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is good
news about overcare,

00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it's that you never get
to overcare unless you

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:90%
cared in the first place.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So you
can always go back

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to the original care about
the person or the situation.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can rekindle
that feeling of care.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It just becomes a
little exercise,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.461 align:middle line:84%
a game to be played
of catching overcare.

00:18:10.461 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting that
you would go there, especially

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
in HeartMath because you're
talking about this intuition

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and how you can sense
things before they happen

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.927 align:middle line:84%
A person in overcare
would be out of balance

00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:90%
with something like that, right?

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.088 align:middle line:84%
You'll cut off from
those feelings.

00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, we cut
ourselves off from a lot

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
of the good things that are
there for us, like intuition.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from, to me,
having a difficult time learning

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.122 align:middle line:90%
how to regulate our emotions.

00:18:39.122 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm using the term regulate
very intentionally there.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't want that to be
confused with suppressing

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:90%
emotions or not Feeling

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
going to mention that.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
traumatic childhoods

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
when you have that level
of-- and the tendency

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:90%
is to suppress or disconnect.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:84%
How can HeartMath help
with something like that?

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, with
HeartMath, our approach

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is just to acknowledge, to
look at, and acknowledge

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the emotions that we feel.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But then to recognize that
we have a power within us.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And the power that sometimes
goes underestimated

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is we have the power and ability
to make emotional choices.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.746 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are not just
something that happen to us.

00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
They are something
that we can actually

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
begin to direct and control
through our choices.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.077 align:middle line:84%
And so acknowledge the
emotions that we feel.

00:19:27.077 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't suppress them.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't wipe them
under the carpet.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of cases, not
all, but in a lot of cases,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessary
to dig on into them

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure out where
they came from and why

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Many of the emotions we can
experience can be shifted.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
If I'm at the
airport later today

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and I get irritated
and frustrated

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
at a long line or
something, I don't

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.055 align:middle line:84%
need to try to analyze
where that came from.

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many times
have I waited my life?

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You know, I just
need to shift it, right?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I can learn to
make emotional choices

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:90%
in that regard.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
As we string together
emotional choices

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
that are more uplifting over
time, it begins to change us.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know, you
just mentioned resilience.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned something
that you have perfected.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Many have not.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
That ability to bounce
back or not get upset about

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:90%
and to move on.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Those three things
you just said.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
That is a skill you've probably
spent a lot of time perfecting.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.696 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
about perfection.

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:27.099 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's an ongoing process.

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it is for all of us.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.223 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Growing and
changing all the time.

00:20:30.223 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:90%
But you're right, it is a skill.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And here's one
way to look at it.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at it from the lens
of energy accumulation

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%
or depletion.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We wake
up every morning

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
with a certain amount of mental,
emotional, and physical energy.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And then how we
spend that energy

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
during the course
of the day ends up

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.306 align:middle line:84%
determining the
quality of that day.

00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of the choices
that we make,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
especially emotionally, add
to our energy bank account.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And some don't.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Some drain it.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so
resilience is something--

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
the way we look at
resilience at HeartMath

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, it is the
ability to bounce back.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But we also look at
it through the lens

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of it being a reservoir
of energy we accumulate.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:90%
We build it.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you build up your energy
bank account or the resilience

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.379 align:middle line:90%
that you have in that account.

00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then is that
you move through life with less

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:90%
stress and less strain.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:90%
You have more flow.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You begin to deflect
stressors before they even

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
have a chance to take you out.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the
big things come up,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
when the triggers
really do happen,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you go through that
process, but you get back

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to the feeling of balance.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So you return to
home more quickly,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
more to draw from.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you do come back
more quickly to a place

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
where life feels better.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you wake up with a
certain amount of this energy.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And good things make
you add to the energy.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And then there's things
that deplete the energy.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to have more
things in your life--

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean it could be
a scented candle.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be a conversation
with someone, a stranger,

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
that was great.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean it could be those little
things that just fill you up,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Want to take
it one more level?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's our response to
those things that determines

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the energy bank account.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We can often setup
scenarios or situations

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
in our life that promote
well-being, promote that type

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.837 align:middle line:90%
of lifestyles that we want.

00:22:19.837 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Whether there's a scented
candle or the walk

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.426 align:middle line:84%
on the beach or a course
that we take or watching

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
a show like we're watching
today, all of that

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
is the choices that people make
to give them an opportunity

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to then make choices about
how they react to it.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Here's an analogy.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.587 align:middle line:84%
Walt Disney built Disney
World as a place people

00:22:36.587 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:84%
could go where they could just
go away from their regular life

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and experience a complete
wonderful, beautiful, happy

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
fantasy land, right?

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And today, or any
day really, people

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
can go to Disney
World or Disneyland

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and they can experience
some of that in the spirit

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:90%
it was intended.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Or they can stay upset and angry
about long lines, high prices,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
what the kids are
doing or what was

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
said in the car between
them and a spouse

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:90%
before they went to the park.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.789 align:middle line:90%
All that's a choice.

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So the environment of
Disney World can be lifting

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:90%
or it can be just another day.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with anything
that we bring into our lives.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So the next level
of that is to learn

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that it's still
an inside-out job

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and that it is
intelligent to put things

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.394 align:middle line:84%
in our life that promote a lift
in spirit or a lift in growth.

00:23:22.394 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But then it becomes a matter
of let's take advantage

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it is our
response to the line

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
at Disneyland or whatever,
it's our response

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to that we can control.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not suggesting we
walk around like robots

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and never feel anything.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.484 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I've
learned over the years

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that there's certain
points in time when

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I can just cut that stuff off
and recognize it's not right.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not helping me.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not helping anybody else.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And make that conscious
choice from a mature place

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
using good old heart to
help me make that move.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what if we were to do
this collectively as a society,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%
as groups?

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have done
these experiments.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You know,
when you alluded

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to that a few minutes ago and
I didn't answer your question,

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.098 align:middle line:84%
there is a movement happening
in the world right now.

00:24:07.098 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
A very lifting powerful
movement happening

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
amidst all the confusion and
chaos and stuff that we see.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I call it the Ad Heart Movement.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a movement where
people are manifesting

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
very naturally, but
very intentionally,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
aspects and qualities of heart.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Which means more cooperation
and less competition.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
It means more innovation
rather than simply

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:90%
succumbing to the problems.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It is being kinder,
more compassionate, more

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:90%
understanding, more listening.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Considering the whole, rather
than just the individual self.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening
all over the world.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I see it everywhere that I go.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I see people that are
beginning to live this way.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Their values are changing.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:10%
Their perspectives are changing.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
They are being more contributing
to the well-being of the world

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and to others.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have movements
of other kinds happening today.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I see them sort of as umbrellaed
by this Ad Heart Movement,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:84%
but why you have people standing
up for certain things now.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Where you have these kids
in Parkland, Florida,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that created a movement
around gun control.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
There hearts are opening
up saying enough of this.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't necessarily
look like heart

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
like we've seen it
before, which is

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:90%
always soft and always sweet.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's got
aspects of, look, we

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.445 align:middle line:90%
need to take care of this in it.

00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see that with
the MeToo movement as well.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
These movements are
predicated by chaos and crisis

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and something that gets you
to the deeper, deeper part

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Rather than that
romantic love part,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
there's a deep,
passionate, almost--

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.332 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say anger,
but that spurs it on.

00:25:43.332 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
anger can start it.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.165 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
movement really

00:25:46.165 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
starts to take on its true power
is when it ripens and matures

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
into where some of that
anger at judgment goes away

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes like let's just
find a way to get this worked

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
out and get it done.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it takes
an initial thrust

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:90%
to get the ball rolling.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
intelligence over time

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
matures and goes into ways
in which it can really

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
be orchestrated.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times,
getting something changed

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
is not always going to get
there by hammering on it.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.522 align:middle line:84%
You know it requires a nuanced
approach to get that done.

00:26:15.522 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
movements end up

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:90%
getting to a place like that.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So this connection
that's happening

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
around the world and these
qualities of heart that are

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:90%
showing up are what excites me.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.461 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I've been
doing this a long time.

00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And to see this actually
manifesting in my lifetime,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to see-- yeah, I
see the problems.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of those and
my compassion goes out.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have a great
story here of Josh and Mabel.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great way to show
kind of heart and intuition.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.705 align:middle line:90%
Can you share this with us?

00:26:42.705 --> 00:26:43.505 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're doing
at HeartMath now in terms

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.195 align:middle line:84%
of our research, our Rollin
McCraty and the research team,

00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
they are doing a lot of
work on understanding

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
energetic connectivity, showing
that we are all connected

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
through a vast web of
energetic connections

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that exist on this
planet and beyond.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And that every living system
is connecting energetically.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Now some really cool
experiments have been done just

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate this.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.105 align:middle line:84%
And one of those that you've
asked me to talk about

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
is Josh and Mabel.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Mabel was a beautiful Labrador
retriever, sweetest heart

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:90%
you could ever imagine.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:90%
She was my dog.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Josh is the son of Rollin
McCraty, Director of Research.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Josh and Mabel developed
a loving relationship.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.792 align:middle line:84%
And one day Roland
decided he would

00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:90%
see if he could measure that.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can see changes
in emotional state

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
by looking at changes
in our heart rhythms.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
really synced up, we

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.631 align:middle line:84%
enter this state
called coherence.

00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in this
state of coherence,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
our heart rhythms become
very sine wave like.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawing it now in the air.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Sine wave like pattern.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And that means you're
really in sync with yourself

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's called
the coherent state.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So he put devices on
the dog and the boy

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.017 align:middle line:90%
that can measure heart rhythms.

00:27:53.017 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
He had the boy in one room
and the dog in another.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
He told Josh to
walk into that room

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and not touch Mabel,
just walk into the room.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:90%
So Josh walks into the room.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he
enters the room, he

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:84%
goes into the state of
coherence as he sees Mabel.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.207 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, exactly
the same time, the dog does to.

00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Matches him?

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Matches the heart rhythm.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exact same pattern.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Exact same
pattern at the same time.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can see
this on the screen.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Synchronized.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.781 align:middle line:84%
And then Josh leaves the
room and Mabel's pattern

00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:90%
goes back to the normal pattern.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a picture of the
power of love between a boy

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and a dog through
a scientific lens.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's beautiful,
because it sort of grounds

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:90%
the science out.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, science
is very complex.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But when you see synchronization
measured through changes

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
in heart that are being
experienced not through touch

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:90%
in this case--

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.836 align:middle line:90%
although they could be helpful--

00:28:42.836 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
but just through being
in a loving situation.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And Josh and Mabel's a great
way to illustrate that.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So this electromagnetic
field, essentially,

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.542 align:middle line:90%
is what they're sharing, right?

00:28:54.542 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They are
sharing that for sure.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So this field, we know
happens interpersonally

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and with loved ones.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
bit about globally

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.950 align:middle line:90%
how this could help us.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've touched on
this a little bit.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%
But the Earth's magnetic field.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This is
really fun stuff.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:10%
The Earth has magnetic fields.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:10%
Think about them like
energetic ecology.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:10%
They're protective
layers around our Earth

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:10%
that protect us from incoming
solar winds and space

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:10%
weather and all that.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
If the fields weren't
there, nothing

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that we would associate
with life would be here.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:90%
We'd be a dead planet.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have a geomagnetic
field in the ionosphere.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, these fields are
constantly changing.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And what changes them a
lot is solar activity.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so as the sun changes and
more solar flares and radiation

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and all of that and changes
in solar wind speed,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:84%
things like that,
fields begin to change.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of science
has already been

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.560 align:middle line:84%
done in showing these
fields are affecting us.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Human health and behavior
is being influenced

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:90%
by the geomagnetic fields.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.045 align:middle line:84%
But what we're discovering
today through the new research

00:29:59.045 --> 00:30:01.586 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing is that we're
more synchronized than we ever

00:30:01.586 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:84%
The changes in these fields
are creating mass effects

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:84%
around the planet
that are very similar.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:10%
A recent study we did
was done with people

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:10%
in five different countries
around the world over a period

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:10%
of a number of months wearing
portable heart rate variability

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:10%
recorders, looking
at heart rhythms.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And then being sent
psychometric surveys randomly

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of what are you feeling
right now and all of that.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And then correlating what was
happening with the sun, what

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
was happening in geomagnetic
field measurement,

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:90%
with that outcome.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And what we were able to
see is that similar effects

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
were occurring all around
the world at the same time.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:84%
People's heart rhythms were
changing and corresponding

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:90%
to the geomagnetic field.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.674 align:middle line:84%
It's important to me
because what it's showing

00:30:44.674 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
is that we're all connected.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:90%
We're in this together.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
We're less separate
than we think.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But did you
record the solar flare

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
before or after
the measurements?

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, we would
look at the solar flare

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that you know that
there is one happening.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a little
time for that effect

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
to get to the Earth.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But then looking at what's
happening in the readings

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:90%
we're getting from the people.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And also what they're reporting
through the psychometric

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.710 align:middle line:84%
surveys and seeing
correlations happening

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
that are taking place.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean these people
are in Saudi Arabia.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
They were Lithuania.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:90%
They were in California.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was amazing.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, the
interconnectivity research

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing is
designed, I think,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to give us a sense
that we're not alone.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, it's true.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I was watching-- there's a
game-- it was the World Cup.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
underdog team, Mexico,

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and they were playing
against Germany.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And there was an upset
at the end of the game.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And Mexico won.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment
that Mexico won,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:84%
it was actually registered
as seismic activity

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
on the Richter scale because
of the explosive emotion

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that came from Mexico,
in Mexico and the region.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Which is so amazing
because it shows,

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
not only the spirit of
Mexico around soccer,

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.550 align:middle line:84%
but it showed the
on the Richter scale

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
that activity that happened
because everybody was doing it

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't electromagnetic.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.205 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
seismic activity.

00:32:17.205 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Which is fascinating.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:90%
So I see that.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean a lot of that can happen
around sporting events and so

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
forth or Olympics and so
forth when you see the world

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:90%
come together.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We are
testing all that.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are you?

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Through the Global
Coherence Initiative,

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
our projects, we--

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's talk about that.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --created a network
of sensor sites, very sensitive

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
technology that measures
changes in the geomagnetic field

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:90%
and the ionosphere.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're placing
those around the world

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and feeding information
back to our research labs

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:90%
in northern California.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing that for a
variety of reasons-- one,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to the academic
understanding of these fields,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:84%
two, to continue to develop
the research on the effect

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:90%
those fields are having on us.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But also, we are testing
an interesting hypothesis.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Hypothesis simply
said would be this

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that mass human emotion,
whether positive or negative

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.472 align:middle line:84%
is having a measurable impact
on the Earth's energetic fields.

00:33:10.472 --> 00:33:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it's the reverse.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Reverse.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of
research has to go in

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.526 align:middle line:84%
to seeing if a hypothesis
like this is true or not.

00:33:17.526 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It has to be looked
at during neutrally

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:90%
to be doing good science, right?

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But our belief is that when
you have 7.7 billion people

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
on the planet all feeling
something all with their own

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:84%
feels, that when a mass
emotion is experienced

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
in a large number of people
that it could be influencing

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:90%
those fields and be detected.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, what I envision
is it we'll get to the point

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
where the technology is
sophisticated enough,

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can identify
certain regions in the world

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.739 align:middle line:84%
that we-- let's
say-- call them spots

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
where the field is different
from the other parts

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:90%
of the field.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.751 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean you would think
that the electromagnetic field

00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
from northern California
would differ than that

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.834 align:middle line:90%
of the one in Saudi Arabia.

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Look at the history,
look at what's happening.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's is possible
that it does.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, it takes a lot of
time and energy and research

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I applaud our scientists--

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Spoken like
a true scientist.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.409 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They are, I mean,
most of the time it would

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:84%
be something like a
government or a big university

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
that takes this on, but
HeartMath's taking it on

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to do this type of research.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's helping to
show something I said earlier

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
connected energetically

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
through this vast web of
energetic connections.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.989 align:middle line:84%
And that's important because
it recognizes that we

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.830 align:middle line:90%
are influencing each other.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So our electromagnetic
field and our coherent state

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
can actually impact
other living systems

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.328 align:middle line:90%
like plants, trees, animals.

00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:41.128 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:34:41.128 --> 00:34:43.044 align:middle line:84%
We're doing some very
interesting research now

00:34:43.044 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:84%
on trees, looking at the
electrical energy produced

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
by trees, around
the world, actually.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know nature has
an influence on us.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.810 align:middle line:90%
We feel that.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.958 align:middle line:84%
That's why we take that walk
in the woods or on the beach.

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.624 align:middle line:84%
It can probably go
the other way as well

00:34:55.624 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that we are interfacing and
connecting on energetic levels

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.539 align:middle line:84%
with all living systems,
including plants and trees.

00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:10%
And some of the new research
that we're doing right now

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:10%
is exploring that and
discovering some amazing things

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:10%
about trees.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.807 align:middle line:10%
They're putting sensors on trees
all around the world as well.

00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:10%
And they're showing, of
course, that trees produce

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:10%
a lot of electrical energy.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're also showing that
electrical energy in the trees

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is being affected by the
energetic fields of the planet.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that the same geomagnetic
influences that affect people

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:90%
are also affecting plants.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Which again, is building this
bridge between all living

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
systems interconnected and
finding out some amazing things

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:90%
about trees that I didn't know.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.899 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Plants communicate.

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They communicate through
a variety of ways.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They often communicate
chemically.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can have
an infestation, let's say,

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that it comes into a forest.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And those trees will
communicate with one another.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And the first ones
hit will communicate.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones that
haven't been hit yet

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
can release enzymes
and protect themselves.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And they actually a whole
communication goes on.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In "National Geographic," what
I read was is that and more

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.740 align:middle line:84%
said that in some places,
the trees actually--

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
trees and plants actually
share nutrients across species

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.152 align:middle line:90%
through the roots.

00:36:15.152 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that when you have
a group of trees over here

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that is doing
really and you might

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.903 align:middle line:84%
have another group of trees,
a different species, that's

00:36:20.903 --> 00:36:23.097 align:middle line:84%
not doing so good, they'll
send them nutrients.

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Like an immune system.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And trees are doing
this all the time.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know this.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
communication happening even

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:84%
at the level of
plants and trees.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Now all living
systems' connected.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
This is important
because it shows

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that we feed the
field with what we do,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts
and our feelings.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And a question that I
ask myself all the time

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
is what am I feeding
the field right now?

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm making
a contribution

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that is, in some way, impacting
the well-being of everything

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:90%
else, the well-being of others.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So even with that
daily thought-- that's not even

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:84%
daily-- moment to
moment thought,

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
you're affecting and
impacting the field.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.345 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really
makes you think

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.929 align:middle line:90%
about what your thoughts are.

00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:04.728 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It does.

00:37:04.728 --> 00:37:06.582 align:middle line:84%
And also a belief I've
had for a long time,

00:37:06.582 --> 00:37:08.165 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's based
now upon experience

00:37:08.165 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
is I believe that we all live in
this vast field of energy that

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is reflecting back to us not
what we just think up here,

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
but really what we
feel right here.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Our true self, our true
heart is feeding this field.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's reflecting back.

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of our life
and what happens in our life

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is, in many ways, being
determined by that reflection.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We're making some very important
choices right now individually

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.565 align:middle line:84%
and collectively, as
a global society, that

00:37:35.565 --> 00:37:37.220 align:middle line:90%
are influencing our future.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.531 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:39.531 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's not easy.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We started our
conversation today

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
with the challenges
people face dealing

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:90%
with all of this change.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is more
than just hope.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Hope is cool.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But hope is a leader into
understanding that there

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:90%
is change in the air.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I want people to
understand that they

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:84%
have this beautiful part of
themselves inside called heart.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when you say
that we can make daily changes

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and we can really think
really intentionally what

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:84%
we're putting into the
field, yet at the same time,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a lack of morality
happening in the field as well.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So are we able to, if
there are enough of us,

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:84%
impact the damage that
the lack of morality

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.220 align:middle line:90%
would do to the field?

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.127 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What size of numbers?

00:38:27.127 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:90%
How would that work?

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.709 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's hard
to put a number on it.

00:38:29.709 --> 00:38:33.267 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I'll just use a
good old backyard analogy.

00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is more
powerful than incoherence.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.785 align:middle line:84%
Order is more concentrated
and focused than disorder.

00:38:38.785 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen these commercials
on TV where they'll say,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.175 align:middle line:84%
you know, buy this solution
and you can clean anything.

00:38:45.175 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say and
only put one cap

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.570 align:middle line:90%
of this in the gallon of water.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's concentrated.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.774 align:middle line:84%
It can offset and influence
that whole gallon of water.

00:38:54.774 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of
love, a little bit

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of care, a little bit
of kindness put out

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of chaos and
confusion can be like that.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It can change things.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You think about in your life,
how many of the little caring

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:84%
acts that you experienced in
your life have stayed with you

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.060 align:middle line:84%
your whole life,
little things people

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.540 align:middle line:84%
did, people you may
not have even known,

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:90%
that you still remember?

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take but a little
bit of heart put into the world

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to offset a lot of
that lack of heart.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.582 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I find you
beautifully optimistic.

00:39:26.582 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Well, I am.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.496 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
the beautifully part,

00:39:29.496 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:90%
but I'm optimistic, yeah.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.416 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's not a challenge
I can throw at you that you

00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:90%
don't have a great answer for.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
here's the thing.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways we can
deal with these changing times

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is to always at least
make the effort to--

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use an unusual
term now-- turn up the edges.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Always try to take it this way.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:84%
No matter what happens,
recognize you can handle it.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It will get handled
at some point.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:90%
You will handle it.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Try to keep the things
turned up a little bit.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
If you do that
moment to moment, day

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to day for a while,
what's going to happen

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is the whole thing
begins to change.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:90%
The viewpoints begin to change.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And you do become more
naturally optimistic.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself to be like
a pragmatically optimistic.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't--

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because of the science?

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I don't-- well,
because I don't ignore

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:90%
the problems.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I do see that we got a lot
of challenges in front of us.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the optimism
is coming from the fact

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that I believe that
we are going to have

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.065 align:middle line:90%
a new and very different world.

00:40:27.065 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And it won't take
forever to get there.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.346 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would
that look like?

00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's hard to say.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I get asked this in
interviews from time to time,

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.406 align:middle line:84%
so I finally had to come up with
my true, authentic answer which

00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:37.357 align:middle line:90%
is I don't know.

00:40:37.357 --> 00:40:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, come on.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.154 align:middle line:90%
Give me an idea.

00:40:39.154 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Here's
what's happening.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We are going through
a dimensional shift

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We've never experienced anything
like this on Earth before.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And what's coming is something
we've never had before.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:10%
The best we can do
right now is to try

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:10%
to put new clothes on
old things to determine

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:10%
what it's going to be like,
but it's something different.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.555 align:middle line:84%
If we were living
in the late 1800s

00:41:01.555 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and we were sitting
outside and the guy said,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
you know-- he comes up on a
horse and buggy-- and he says,

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's going
to be new transportation.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.289 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, we
can't see at that point

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:90%
the airline industry.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
What we see at that point
is a different horse

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.254 align:middle line:90%
or a different buggy.

00:41:15.254 --> 00:41:16.420 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of where we are.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:10%
We haven't seen
around the corner yet.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:10%
What's coming is
going to be amazing.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's inevitable.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that
the shift that's

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.900 align:middle line:84%
going on in consciousness
and the reemergence of heart

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is part of the evolutionary
imperative of our time.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that whether we like it
or not, it's going to happen.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we do have influence
over are two main things.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We can influence
how long it takes.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can influence how
hard or how easy it can be.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.280 align:middle line:90%
We can make the ride smoother.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And we can make it shorter.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.424 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we're
going to get there.

00:41:52.424 --> 00:41:53.840 align:middle line:84%
The world is not
going to blow up.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We're headed in the
right direction.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.432 align:middle line:84%
You know, I see the trend
graph going this way,

00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:84%
like moving in the
right direction.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you got the ups and
downs along that graph--

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
this terrorist
attack, this tsunami,

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.920 align:middle line:84%
this problem with whatever,
politics, who knows--

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I see the trend graph like this.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.840 align:middle line:90%
But I see it going that way.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I see it's inevitable.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I see the human
spirit is emerging

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.975 align:middle line:84%
in such beautiful
and dynamic ways.

00:42:17.975 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:84%
When our backs are against
the wall, a lot of times

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is when we found
our true hearts.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And when people find
that heart, then they

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
come into this beautiful
being that they really

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.720 align:middle line:84%
are, beautiful person
that they really are.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So backs against the
wall a lot of times

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is what it's taken
to get people there.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.582 align:middle line:84%
That can improve
and has improved.

00:42:35.582 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You give
this great example

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.380 align:middle line:84%
about the solar activity and
how the solar activity is

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:84%
correlated with these
bursts of creativity.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So could we basically
take the-- and I'd love you

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to explain that a
little bit more--

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and can we take the kinetic
activity of, say, a storm

00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and transfer that into
something positive?

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.151 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of these
energetic influences

00:43:03.151 --> 00:43:04.775 align:middle line:84%
I'll call them, like
the solar activity

00:43:04.775 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:90%
or whatever are really neutral.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
not out to get us.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.900 align:middle line:90%
They're neutral.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.834 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It depends on
how we're relating to them.

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:16.886 align:middle line:84%
What vibration are we accessing
that influence through?

00:43:16.886 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have gone
back into history

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and been able to look at
plants and various things

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
solar cycles, right?

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And they can see that some
of the greatest flourishings

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.250 align:middle line:84%
in arts and science
and all of that

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in the history of humankind were
happening when the solar cycles

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:90%
were really high.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.692 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many people
look through the lens

00:43:36.692 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of the solar cycle
being something that's

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:90%
bad that's out to get them.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a solar flare, oh, my
god, it's coming to get me.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, there can be some
energetic influence there.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It can increase irritability
and frustration.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.675 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is a solar flare.

00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's an
injection, a mass ejection,

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.429 align:middle line:84%
of energy that
comes from the sun.

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, the sun sort of
exploding all the time.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So a mass ejection of
that, it sends particles

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.012 align:middle line:90%
to the outer space.

00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And they hit the Earth.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And they hit the
geomagnetic field.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what lights
it up and all that.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, there are
heightened activity in that.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:84%
There's more solar
flares, more ejections

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:90%
of energy coming from the sun.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, this comes
back to something

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:84%
we talked about earlier
about that choice.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:84%
We have a choice of emotional
response to anything.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And whatever influences
are out there,

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.440 align:middle line:84%
we have a choice over
how we manage that.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And the choices, the
direction of those choices--

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.040 align:middle line:90%
this always works best for me--

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.230 align:middle line:84%
has really been consulting
with my heart's intelligence

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.430 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Logical, linear
processing a lot of times

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:39.839 align:middle line:90%
doesn't get it done for me.

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have to make the
business decisions and things

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.947 align:middle line:90%
like that from that place.

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to other
sort of major decisions

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and guidance around
what I do, it

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:84%
requires that connection to
the deeper heart that I have.

There's a lot happening.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.280 align:middle line:84%
There will be new technologies
coming out of HeartMath.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.670 align:middle line:84%

new things for me

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:22.900 align:middle line:90%
to share with you.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing some
new things with you

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.830 align:middle line:84%

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.724 align:middle line:84%
And just to touch on
that a little bit,

00:45:29.724 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
the emWave technology,
it's an at home hand device

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that you can measure
your coherent field.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And the other one was called?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.333 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Inner Balance Trainer.

00:45:39.333 --> 00:45:40.872 align:middle line:84%
We took the same
patented technology

00:45:40.872 --> 00:45:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that we put into other
devices, we put it

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.375 align:middle line:90%
into mobile applications.

00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:45.439 align:middle line:84%
So you now have it on your
phone, or your tablet,

00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:90%
or your pad, or whatever.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You get a sensor, it
connects to your ear.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:51.250 align:middle line:84%
It measures the changes
in your heart rhythms.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Scores them for the
degree of coherence,

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.035 align:middle line:90%
the higher coherence the better.

00:45:55.035 --> 00:45:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And it trains us to become
more naturally coherent.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And this has been very,
very successful for us.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And there's more coming.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Yep, yep.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Lots of ways that
we can actually

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:84%
influence the field, our
field to be great as well.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:09.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way that
you've measured this

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.430 align:middle line:84%
through this beautiful
light tower called Ilumina.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share that with you
and with our audience today.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.880 align:middle line:90%
It really inspired me.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.760 align:middle line:84%
What happened was is that back
last year, an organization,

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful
organization in Mexico,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:84%
decided to build this
gigantic 30-foot light tower

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and display it at Burning Man.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they came to
us and they said--

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
worked with our engineers--
what we want to do

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is interface your technology
and your HeartMath technique

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.570 align:middle line:90%
into the light tower.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So that people sitting
around the light tower

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:84%
hooked up to what's
called the emWave probe.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.160 align:middle line:84%
They are being led
through a technique.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:84%
As their coherence
level increases,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:84%
it influences the
lights and the sound

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.340 align:middle line:90%
being produced by the tower.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So the people are
interfaced with it.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.405 align:middle line:84%
And they're controlling,
through their coherence,

00:46:55.405 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:84%
through their connection
to their heart, what

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.780 align:middle line:90%
happens in this tower.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.979 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
astounding and amazing.

00:47:00.979 --> 00:47:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're able
to show it to you.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.478 align:middle line:90%

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be the number
of books that I sold

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
or where I spoke in the
world or any of that stuff?

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
how much did I love

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.600 align:middle line:90%
and how much did I not love?

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.987 align:middle line:90%
And that's the measuring stick.

00:50:12.987 --> 00:50:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So I know it sounds kind
of squishy, kind of soft,

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.140 align:middle line:84%
but love is a really
important powerful thing.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It transforms.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:90%
It lives.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.405 align:middle line:84%
It's not just mushy
and sentimental

00:50:21.405 --> 00:50:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and something that shows
up on Valentine's Day.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way to live
life that I think works.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:10%
And if I can do that, then
I'm giving more to life

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.860 align:middle line:10%
than I'm taking from it.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.640 align:middle line:10%
And the whys that
I'm here to help,

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.722 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to help
usher people through--

00:50:38.722 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:10%
do what I can to usher people
through these changing times.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's the why for me.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's great.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And you've done a great job.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:90%
And there's more to come.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:90%
More to come.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For sure.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
showing us how our world

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.482 align:middle line:90%
can be a better place.

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Thank you,
Lisa, for having me.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure as always.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.737 align:middle line:84%
And how we can impact the
field with our thoughts.
