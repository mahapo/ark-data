00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.374 align:middle line:84%
My gift today is Ron Teeguarden,
named a master herbalist

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:90%
by three herbal masters.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.644 align:middle line:90%
Ron, along with his wife,

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.414 align:middle line:84%
Jan Lin own the Dragon
Herbs company,

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.115 align:middle line:84%
where they provide
knowledge and materials

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.185 align:middle line:84%
to the western culture, based
on ancient wisdom brought

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.620 align:middle line:90%
from Chinese tonic herbalism.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.023 align:middle line:84%
Ron and his wife have spent the
last thirty years cultivating

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.625 align:middle line:84%
and collecting these
herbs in China,

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.994 align:middle line:84%
and he is joining us today
to talk about the art

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:31.265 align:middle line:84%
of cultivating adaptogenic
herbs, to create radiant health.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.967 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show,
thank you for being here.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: It's
great to be here, thank you

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: SO, tell me
what an adaptogenic herb is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.705 align:middle line:90%
and what it does

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: Well,
adaptogenic herb is a type

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.643 align:middle line:84%
of herb like you know is
different types of things,

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.079 align:middle line:90%
like cathartics or laxatives.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
major categories

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.682 align:middle line:90%
of herbs is called adaptogenic.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.186 align:middle line:84%
These are the types of herbs
you can take an extended basis

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:56.323 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of helping the
body to overcome, or be capable

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:00.394 align:middle line:84%
of overcoming different kinds of
stress, so that, in other words,

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.797 align:middle line:84%
when you take adaptogenic
herb, it becomes very hot,

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:07.067 align:middle line:84%
your body adapts more properly,
as the word adapts, adaptogenic

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Cool

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Ron Teeguarden: And it
would help it to stay cool,

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.206 align:middle line:84%
and on the other hand if
something gets very cold,

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.775 align:middle line:84%
your body will adapt
to that more easily,

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.176 align:middle line:90%
and maintain itself.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:20.281 align:middle line:84%
But it also works with stress
and emotional things that happen

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.249 align:middle line:84%
to us, so if we are
out in the work place

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.717 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly it is a
very stressful day,

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.419 align:middle line:84%
you know how you
can just crack up,

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
or if you are taking adaptogenic
herbs, you handle the stresses

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.261 align:middle line:84%
of life, be it physical
labor or emotional stress,

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
you handle it much
more efficiently,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.197 align:middle line:90%
and that is really important

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because then you do
not drain your body,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.369 align:middle line:84%
because when you are stressed
you are producing cortisol

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.537 align:middle line:90%
and all those-

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, I
was going to ask you

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.175 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Stress reactions to the
body, which causes us to age,

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.511 align:middle line:84%
and causes all kinds
of disorders to occur,

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:51.911 align:middle line:90%
but if you are not stressed out,

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
then your body stays
much more chemically

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.082 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally balanced.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.318 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So it literally
will balance the cortisol

00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:58.719 align:middle line:90%
in the body?

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.287 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well it does that because
your body will not produce the

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.423 align:middle line:90%
cortisol in the first place

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: In the first place

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.894 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Your stress
reaction becomes efficient.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.796 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are still
going to have to deal with,

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.264 align:middle line:84%
if you are sitting
on a railroad track

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:13.467 align:middle line:84%
and there is a train coming,
you need a burst of adrenaline

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.769 align:middle line:84%
to get off the track, but you
are not going to be hanging

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.172 align:middle line:84%
onto it the whole day
going, oh my life is ruined

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.674 align:middle line:84%
because I am all stressed
out, I'm still nervous.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You just get over things,
and you get back to it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.812 align:middle line:84%
and your body does
not become harmed,

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.414 align:middle line:84%
and that is why the adaptogenic
herbs are also considered

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:32.118 align:middle line:84%
to be longevity herbs, and the
anti-aging herbs do not affect

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:33.387 align:middle line:90%
you the same way.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.556 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So the, some of the
harmful effects of stress

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.759 align:middle line:84%
of course is a speeding of the
aging process, inflammation,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.162 align:middle line:84%
those types of things,
so adaptogenic herbs tend

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.164 align:middle line:84%
to decrease inflammation
as well?

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well I think all
of the adaptogenic herbs

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that I know of, and I
think I know most of them,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.008 align:middle line:84%
have anti-inflammatory
effects, now, that does not mean

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:84%
that they are used to
treat inflammatory diseases

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.415 align:middle line:84%
like arthritis or
something like that.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle line:84%
These are to promote
the function of the body

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:84%
so that it stays in balance, so
that you do not develop the kind

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:11.091 align:middle line:84%
of abhorrent inflammation
that does cause us to age,

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:14.294 align:middle line:84%
which is called inflamaging,
that is the new term

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:20.901 align:middle line:84%
in longevity circles is as
we inflame, as we live longer

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:25.505 align:middle line:84%
and become inflamed and then,
you know, causes us to age.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:29.443 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So are the Chinese herbs
better taken as a preventative,

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:34.314 align:middle line:84%
or are they O.K. for
reducing specific illnesses?

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.517 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, Chinese
herbs can be used for,

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:37.851 align:middle line:90%
there are herbs for everything.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.319 align:middle line:90%
There are thousands of herbs.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:84%
It is the most developed
herbal system in the world;

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.058 align:middle line:84%
it is way beyond
what I can learn

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
in a lifetime or
any herbal estam.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.629 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
herbs, which you would go

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.165 align:middle line:84%
to a Chinese doctor, and they
can give you a concoction,

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:54.701 align:middle line:84%
or something, that you take for
one day or two day, you know,

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.471 align:middle line:84%
for some disorder, and
then take another one,

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.939 align:middle line:84%
you cannot take those
for a long time,

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.041 align:middle line:90%
because they are unidirectional.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.277 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry goes in one
direction and does something,

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.513 align:middle line:84%
that is why you need
expert care.

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.282 align:middle line:84%
The tonic herbs on the
other hand are kind of like,

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.486 align:middle line:84%
universal, anybody can take
them, you take them like food.

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:17.057 align:middle line:84%
They are like having almonds and
raisins, or something like that,

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:21.095 align:middle line:84%
but only at a very high
level of benefit to the body.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:84%
They contain specific chemistry
that makes us live longer,

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.403 align:middle line:84%
age more slowly, benefits
our cardiovascular

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:32.172 align:middle line:84%
and nervous system, and liver,
but with no side effects.

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.241 align:middle line:84%
So they are like an
extra food group,

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.943 align:middle line:90%
and just a very special one.

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.277 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.447 align:middle line:84%
So you have been to incredibly
beautiful places in China,

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.383 align:middle line:84%
and we have a video here
where you are going to talk us

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.319 align:middle line:84%
through some of these places,
so we are bringing China

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.088 align:middle line:84%
to you today, through
this video.

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:50.924 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all what are these
berries we are looking at?

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.026 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: That is schisandra,

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:84%
it actually means it is
called five flavor tea,

00:04:57.364 --> 00:05:00.167 align:middle line:84%
because it has different
kinds of flavors in it.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.069 align:middle line:84%
That was my teacher Sun Jin
Park [assumed spelling],

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.871 align:middle line:84%
he was lifting a barbell
with his teeth there,

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.873 align:middle line:84%
but he was my great
teacher who taught me

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:90%
about the three treasures.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.344 align:middle line:84%
That is him now,
forty-five years later.

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:11.778 align:middle line:84%
This is Shin Nang
[assumed spelling],

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.213 align:middle line:84%
the founder of Chinese
herbalism.

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:15.649 align:middle line:84%
He divided the herbs
into tonic general

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.484 align:middle line:90%
and inferior herbs and so forth.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.454 align:middle line:84%
This is schisandra
once it is dried,

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.223 align:middle line:84%
and that is it once
it when it is fresh.

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:27.194 align:middle line:84%
I am fortunate enough to be able
to go to these wonderful places-

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.696 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And what are the
properties of schisandra?

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.332 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well schisandra is
called the quintessence

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.567 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese herbs.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It is an herb that benefits
virtually every function

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.105 align:middle line:90%
in the body in some kind of way.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.973 align:middle line:90%
It is a major major adaptogen.

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:43.877 align:middle line:84%
It is also very good for
your mind and for your brain,

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and for your memory, yeah
we are just collecting,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.216 align:middle line:84%
Jan Lin [assumed spelling] is
my wife, we were picking some

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.652 align:middle line:84%
at the market we were at the
base of Chung Bai mountain,

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.888 align:middle line:84%
she was just picking some, we
were going to take them home

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:58.058 align:middle line:84%
and put them in some, no
take them back to the hotel,

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.226 align:middle line:90%
put them in some liquor-

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:01.795 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: schisandra wine

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:04.131 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: This is an actually
view of Chung Bai mountain.

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.365 align:middle line:90%
It's a volcano.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:10.604 align:middle line:84%
Chung Bai mountain is a
place that is very special,

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:90%
it mostly stays snow covered.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a rare moment when it is
not, it is called heaven lake,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
you can see how we mote, that
is what I was trying to do

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.583 align:middle line:84%
in this video is give you
an idea of the remoteness

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.284 align:middle line:90%
of where our herbs come from.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.988 align:middle line:84%
These are not farmed in the
flatland down where the corn is

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and soy comes from, uh yeah.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.295 align:middle line:84%
It is the water, and you know
we are, the water is remarkable

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.165 align:middle line:84%
and I can describe that
more later, but that is just

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
up in China, and it
is one of the most,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.836 align:middle line:84%
it is a protected biosphere
by the United Nations.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle line:84%
There is just no industry
near there, and it is one

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.775 align:middle line:84%
of the richest sources
of herbs in the world-

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.344 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Because of that water

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:51.812 align:middle line:84%
because it is so
rich in minerals.

00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:56.883 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Because it is volcanic
water, right, it is mentioned,

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.919 align:middle line:84%
every herb, every
place I get herbs,

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle line:84%
I go to see what
the water is first.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.724 align:middle line:84%
The water, we are made out
of water, water is the basis

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:06.927 align:middle line:84%
of life, and what the source
of water is, it is critical

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.262 align:middle line:90%
to a good herb or not.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.264 align:middle line:84%
I do not think most people
think about that, they just look

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:13.233 align:middle line:84%
at a bottle and it says
schisandra, but ours comes

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
from where the water was from
miles deep from a volcano.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:23.577 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is some time
ago, I am up in the forest,

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:28.915 align:middle line:84%
my great host took me to a herb
walk, and we went out to just

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.652 align:middle line:84%
in Chung Bai mountain, it
is not the highest altitude,

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:38.058 align:middle line:84%
this is these film here is a
moderate, that is Choriolis

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:41.495 align:middle line:84%
versus Pillar, and we are just
looking at a little frog we saw,

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:45.632 align:middle line:84%
and that is my first site
of schisandra growing.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:50.103 align:middle line:84%
It is a vine, it hangs on the
trees, and I am just going

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:52.806 align:middle line:84%
to collect some schisandra, we
are going to go home with a bag

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.207 align:middle line:84%
of it, and a bunch
of other herbs too.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:59.579 align:middle line:84%
We found ginseng, and Siberian
ginseng, we have found wild ,

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:02.782 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of herbs up in
the mountain that day.

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.419 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wild don quay

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.221 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Very happy
to find schisandra.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.523 align:middle line:90%
That was my host.

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:84%
These people know so much
about herbs, it is amazing.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:18.198 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that was wild off
the vine, and my first cut,

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.566 align:middle line:90%
and I look very proud of myself

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:22.436 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's exciting,
it's very exciting.

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Sure, there is nothing
like going out, it is beautiful.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.907 align:middle line:84%
You go out to the forest
and you find these,

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:28.308 align:middle line:90%
this is a magical herb.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Schisandra is one of
the quintessential herbs

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.912 align:middle line:90%
in the world for your health.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:35.315 align:middle line:84%
It is great for your skin and
you beauty and your sex life.

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.819 align:middle line:90%
The very famous imperial women

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:41.722 align:middle line:84%
and the kings always
took schisandra to spur

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:44.024 align:middle line:90%
on their, let's say, libido.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.158 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Fertility-

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:46.159 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, and that
is what we collected,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.327 align:middle line:84%
that was our collection
at the end

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:48.996 align:middle line:90%
of the day, that was our booty

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.263 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.132 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And you see I have
a couple of ginseng roots

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.468 align:middle line:84%
>>LG: What is the
difference between Siberian,

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:58.005 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned other,
oh wow, you put the ginseng

00:08:58.005 --> 00:08:59.306 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, we put
it in liquor,

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:02.609 align:middle line:84%
we actually literally put
it in Chinese white wine.

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.845 align:middle line:84%
We put the ginseng root
and schisandra there,

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:08.181 align:middle line:84%
and that is how we took it
back to our home in Fujo.

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.317 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we went further up the
mountain, and now we are going

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:14.221 align:middle line:84%
up the hill, we are entering
sort of a national park zone

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.124 align:middle line:84%
of the decabou hill and that
is where we are, this is,

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:18.959 align:middle line:84%
it looks like winter,
but actually you can see

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:21.061 align:middle line:84%
from the video before
that it was quite warm,

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.963 align:middle line:90%
this is September.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.465 align:middle line:84%
But it is very, it's at
the snow line up there.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:28.502 align:middle line:84%
You can see the steam is
because this is a volcano,

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:30.704 align:middle line:84%
and these are vents coming
up, you can actually,

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.639 align:middle line:84%
they boil you eggs in
the water coming up,

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.774 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:36.743 align:middle line:84%
But this water coming
down is magical water;

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:39.413 align:middle line:84%
you can see it pouring
over from the lake

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:40.714 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the volcano.

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It is a huge waterfall, and
the biggest in the world.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And the water is very,
very, very mineral.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.192 align:middle line:84%
It is coming from a mile or
so, miles deep in the Earth,

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and it is rich with
some kinds of minerals

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.829 align:middle line:90%
that are not found other places,

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:59.366 align:middle line:84%
and that floods the
entire mountain.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.734 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Valley there

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.669 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: All because there are
rivers coming out on all sides.

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:84%
So, the herbs that grow on
Shanghai mountain are based

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:10.811 align:middle line:84%
on this unique water that has
produced things like ginseng

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and racey, and like I mentioned,
schisandra, these are herbs

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.216 align:middle line:84%
that do not grow well any
place else in the world.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:19.786 align:middle line:84%
They just, they grow, but
they do not grow like this.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:20.921 align:middle line:90%
You know

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.189 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You cannot
replicate that, yes, yes.

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:24.391 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: NO, you cannot
replicate this.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So I am just showing the
water; water is Godly.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.033 align:middle line:84%
You know, it is the source
of life, and so when we go

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:37.304 align:middle line:84%
to get Goji berries or when
we go to get gynostemma,

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:41.107 align:middle line:84%
or ginseng, or schisandra, it
is where the water comes from.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be a spring or it's
got to be a mountain spring

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.346 align:middle line:84%
or a river, or sometimes
we use glacial water,

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.815 align:middle line:84%
but we do not use
irrigation from cheap places,

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.517 align:middle line:84%
and that is why everything
has come

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.652 align:middle line:84%
from the high mountain
or remote place.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.688 align:middle line:84%
The highest level up you
can get before it runs

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
down through any kind
of possible pollutants,

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.061 align:middle line:84%
so this is my ode
to water right now.

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.931 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And the music
under this is composed by

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:08.435 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It was composed by
me, I do that as my hobby,

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I was playing with
it, I am lucky enough

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.774 align:middle line:84%
to have a musician friend,
Harvy Mandell, he even played

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
with the rolling stones
and with many people

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:17.978 align:middle line:90%
as the lead guitarist,

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:21.982 align:middle line:84%
he is performing this
music for me, with me.

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:84%
And that is just showing
the remoteness, you can,

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.485 align:middle line:90%
as far as your eye can see,

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.587 align:middle line:84%
there is no industry,
no pollution.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:29.723 align:middle line:84%
People got worried about
pollution from Chinese herbs,

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:30.857 align:middle line:90%
and I do not blame them.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.792 align:middle line:84%
There are places
where down below,

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.295 align:middle line:84%
some Chinese herb companies,
they get their herbs

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:38.164 align:middle line:84%
from the flat lands, where
you know, regular farms,

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.499 align:middle line:84%
where they are also
spraying other things,

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:42.202 align:middle line:84%
and the soil is not,
but we do not do that.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.804 align:middle line:84%
I personally think that
it is available to get it

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:84%
from these remote places,
why not just go get it,

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:48.909 align:middle line:90%
you know, it is a little work

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.477 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It seems like
there are a lot of venders

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:53.146 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of people
that have done the work for you

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:55.515 align:middle line:84%
from these beautiful places
who are willing to bring it

00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:56.716 align:middle line:90%
down to you and sell it

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.919 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: There are far more
people working for me

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:01.721 align:middle line:84%
in China then here, because
there are people who are

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.858 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, they know the
herbs, it was in their families,

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:09.062 align:middle line:84%
this is generational, and then
we make, we do the production,

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.665 align:middle line:84%
so we make the goji
and schisandra,

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:14.868 align:middle line:84%
where the schisandra ET, which
I can show you in a second,

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a remarkable,
it is really one

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
of the breakthrough
products in really the world,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a health
product, it is actually-

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You have it?

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.345 align:middle line:90%
Yeah Yeah.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: This is it in a little
tub, it is very beautiful.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It is a pink powder, usually

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.725 align:middle line:84%
when you extract an
extract, it just turns brown.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.126 align:middle line:84%
You know, almost all the
extracts in the world

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.561 align:middle line:84%
because that is what
the extraction does,

00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:44.831 align:middle line:84%
but when you get the, when you
use a technique called FIT,

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.033 align:middle line:84%
fingerprint identical
transfer technology,

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:51.071 align:middle line:84%
it is extracted cold, in
cold water, and it is done

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.107 align:middle line:84%
by pressure and not by
cooking, so it extracts all

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.509 align:middle line:84%
of the chemicals out, a
hundred percent identical

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.812 align:middle line:84%
to the raw plant, but
there is no cooking.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:12:59.679 align:middle line:90%
So it is raw.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.047 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Is it compressing it?

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.282 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Actually using pressure

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.585 align:middle line:84%
that is vibrating a hundred
times a second, vacuum,

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:07.621 align:middle line:84%
high pressure vacuum,
like back and forth,

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.423 align:middle line:84%
and it cracks the cells
and basically juices,

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:13.693 align:middle line:84%
things that are too tough
to be juiced in a juicer,

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:15.895 align:middle line:84%
and so you get the juice
powder, then we dry it.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:17.097 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.465 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And it is, so there
is no chemicals in it,

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how pink, you
would not get pink like this

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.669 align:middle line:90%
from a usual, and we do it,

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.505 align:middle line:84%
we always extract things
near where we extract it.

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:28.008 align:middle line:84%
And so we have several factories
in different parts of China.

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
This is actually a, I'm going

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.579 align:middle line:84%
to make a nice strong
one for myself.

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:36.115 align:middle line:84%
This is cold water,
not hot at this point.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:84%
I will stir it and
about a minute

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.519 align:middle line:84%
from now it is going
to just turn-

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:42.088 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: A pretty pink, and it
does not clump up like things do

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.189 align:middle line:90%
when they get into water

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.959 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: No, and instant
teas have chemicals

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.361 align:middle line:84%
that make them instant, this
does not have any chemicals,

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:49.663 align:middle line:90%
it is just schisandra.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:52.799 align:middle line:84%
And schisandra as I said is
called five flavored tea,

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.635 align:middle line:84%
so it is complex, it
has got the five flavors

00:13:55.635 --> 00:14:01.274 align:middle line:84%
and the five elements, so it has
got sour, bitter, sweet, salty,

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:04.978 align:middle line:84%
and spicy, all in
one very complex,

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:06.513 align:middle line:84%
thing is it has got
a unique flavor,

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.915 align:middle line:84%
but this was the official
tea, schisandra was

00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:12.318 align:middle line:84%
of an imperial household,
for a century

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:15.488 align:middle line:84%
where all the women drank
it to maintain their beauty,

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:19.192 align:middle line:84%
and Emperors maintain it to
keep a strong, powerful body

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and mind, you see how
it is starting to-

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.262 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, does it
increase circulation,

00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:25.398 align:middle line:84%
and why does it increase
focus and memory?

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:28.068 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, it is the only
herb in Chinese herbalism,

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:30.603 align:middle line:84%
and this is saying a lot,
with all the kinds of herbs,

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:33.406 align:middle line:84%
including ginseng that
tonifies all three treasures,

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:35.542 align:middle line:90%
that was Jing, Qi, Shen.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.545 align:middle line:84%
So it builds your Jing,
which is your adrenal,

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.113 align:middle line:90%
you know, functions.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.382 align:middle line:84%
It builds your central
nervous system,

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.617 align:middle line:84%
it strengthens your reproductive
system and your brain,

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.087 align:middle line:84%
it makes your brain, like
your memory will get stronger

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:48.288 align:middle line:90%
from drinking it.

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.989 align:middle line:84%
It is very famous for its
beauty, if you drink it

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.992 align:middle line:84%
for a hundred days, then your
skin will completely change.

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:58.531 align:middle line:84%
It will become all like not
wet, but shiny and beautiful.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:84%
It was a famous famous
thing for the people.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.669 align:middle line:90%
Women drink it and still do.

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:03.503 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of course

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:04.771 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: To stay young looking.

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous thing was
the schisandra one hundred

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:07.774 align:middle line:90%
day challenge.

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.142 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people
have done it,

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.745 align:middle line:84%
where you just make sure you
drink schisandra every single

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.913 align:middle line:84%
day, and when I got my
teacher San Jung Park,

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle line:84%
the guy with the barbell
in his mouth a minute ago,

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.854 align:middle line:84%
he had me drink schisandra,
make a, I would grind it

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:22.455 align:middle line:84%
up into a powder
in a coffee grinder

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:25.425 align:middle line:84%
and take a teaspoon a
day for a hundred days

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.794 align:middle line:84%
to build my three
treasures: Jing, Qi, and Shen,

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:29.829 align:middle line:84%
but it was very gritty
and hard to eat.

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:32.398 align:middle line:84%
Now we get the exact same thing,
it is completely extracted,

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.834 align:middle line:84%
all the chemicals are
there in an instant drink,

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:37.737 align:middle line:84%
you can see at this
point there is no residue

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:38.872 align:middle line:90%
or anything, no chemical.

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:40.306 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh it's clear,
it's beautiful,

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and is this something you take,
you drink two teaspoons a day,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.978 align:middle line:90%
or is it throughout the day?

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:47.213 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, you can
do whatever you want.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:52.252 align:middle line:84%
If you took a teaspoon a day
which is my target in life,

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:56.022 align:middle line:84%
that, I think probably
in my opinion,

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:58.024 align:middle line:84%
it would add decades
to your life.

00:15:58.024 --> 00:15:59.425 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.462 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And also it just keeps
you, you know it protects you,

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.298 align:middle line:84%
it protects your liver,
it protects your brain,

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:09.402 align:middle line:84%
it protects your cardiovascular
system, you know, it does a lot

00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:12.672 align:middle line:84%
of things that are important,
so it is just a tonic herb.

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:15.508 align:middle line:84%
You take it every day, and
you can mix other things.

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I do not take one thing,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I take a dozen things every
day because I remember-

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.182 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Tell me what you
take, what do you take?

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, I am a kid in a
candy shop, I am a collector,

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:31.124 align:middle line:84%
so obviously, you know, but
I just take tonic herbs.

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.926 align:middle line:90%
I never take medicinal herbs.

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:33.693 align:middle line:90%
It is like-

00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:34.828 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You don't eat them.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.796 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: I probably needed
them in the beginning

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:39.732 align:middle line:84%
for like a few months when I
was first dealing with things

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.367 align:middle line:84%
but it has been about
thirty-five years

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.002 align:middle line:84%
since I have taken
a medicinal herb.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.406 align:middle line:84%
It is just taking these
things on a daily basis.

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:50.109 align:middle line:84%
So I take, for sure
every day I take reishi.

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.779 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Beautiful beautiful,
this is a reishi mushroom

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:53.712 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: That is a reishi.

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.081 align:middle line:90%
That is a reishi.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:58.017 align:middle line:84%
This is a Mongolian reishi, you
know, this is from Mongolia.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.452 align:middle line:84%
They look different depending
on where you get them, but they,

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:01.988 align:middle line:90%
but it's all got that-

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.023 align:middle line:84%
They build your immune
system, they are protection.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
They are called the
mushroom of immortality.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.193 align:middle line:90%
It builds your spiritual power.

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:11.164 align:middle line:84%
It was the herb of the,
you know like I showed you,

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:13.633 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the great
masters of all time;

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.336 align:middle line:90%
it is called the herb king.

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.172 align:middle line:84%
He lived to be a hundred
years old in real history

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.374 align:middle line:84%
and he has got this
mushroom in his hand

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.142 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And little medicine
boxes, that is all he needs.

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:24.944 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah little
medicine boxes, right right.

00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:26.412 align:middle line:90%
But he was giving medicine,

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:28.815 align:middle line:84%
but for himself he was
using the reishi mushroom.

00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:33.486 align:middle line:84%
And so reishi, I take
gynostemma every day,

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.022 align:middle line:84%
gynostemma is an herb,
it is a leafy plant,

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:37.924 align:middle line:90%
this is one from my garden.

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:40.393 align:middle line:84%
I actually eat this
in my salads;

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.794 align:middle line:90%
I do not drink the tea from it.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.864 align:middle line:84%
The tea I drink is spring
garden tea, and that is where,

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:47.333 align:middle line:84%
that is the original source
where it grows the best

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.737 align:middle line:84%
in the world, so we
make spring dragon tea;

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.838 align:middle line:90%
that is what I will drink.

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:53.773 align:middle line:84%
But I do pull these
off and mix them

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:55.241 align:middle line:90%
with my green salad every day.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.843 align:middle line:84%
These are in my yard
and I just grown them

00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:58.111 align:middle line:84%
and just pulled them
off this morning

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:59.045 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, interesting.

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Are they bitter or
are they sweet?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is just like a green,
just like a typical green,

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:84%
it's like a spinach
or something.

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:06.819 align:middle line:90%
It's pleasant.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Then I, let us see so, reishi,
schisandra every day, ginseng,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.831 align:middle line:84%
ginseng is one of the
major herbs in the world,

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:23.403 align:middle line:84%
it's an adaptogenic,
it protects you,

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.705 align:middle line:84%
it is very immune
system powerful,

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:29.142 align:middle line:84%
when you get really old
ginseng that is more

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
than thirteen years old, then
the death genes turn off,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.016 align:middle line:84%
it actually becomes kind of
an immortal, ginseng will live

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:40.119 align:middle line:84%
to be hundreds of years
old, so I take wild ginseng,

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:84%
because only the
youngest ginseng

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:47.694 align:middle line:84%
in that extract called heaven
drops is fifteen years old

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:49.128 align:middle line:84%
and we have some
sixty, even a hundred,

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle line:84%
even less because you
may have a ginseng

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.198 align:middle line:90%
that was a hundred years old.

00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:55.835 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So how many ginseng roots
do you put into that batch?

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:57.136 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: There are
hundreds, but you know,

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.238 align:middle line:90%
it is all I can buy in a year.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.307 align:middle line:84%
Each one is collected
individually.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.542 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, for a year

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:06.179 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: I have to go and
have them collected for me,

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:08.481 align:middle line:84%
and you know, get them
from different places,

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:12.285 align:middle line:84%
and then you know, I pick
each one myself, heaven drops,

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:14.454 align:middle line:90%
those things, I pick myself.

00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I do not have an employee
that does that yet.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.425 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So those are like
vintage wine bottles, those-

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:22.829 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Especially the cram
of ginseng in the world.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.899 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, everyone
has very ancient roots.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:30.536 align:middle line:84%
You cannot, and everyone had
different adaptogenic needs

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.072 align:middle line:84%
depending on where, what side of
the mountain, or which crevice,

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.875 align:middle line:84%
or you know, how many bugs
attacked it or whatever.

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:40.279 align:middle line:84%
It survived for decades
and decades in Manchuria,

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.181 align:middle line:84%
and it is just a soft
little carrot like thing.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.984 align:middle line:84%
It is not very well
protected in that sense,

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:48.154 align:middle line:84%
but it is the strongest
adaptogen you can imagine.

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:51.457 align:middle line:84%
Talking about that,
I also take rhodiola,

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:52.725 align:middle line:90%
which comes from Tibet.

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
This is rhodiola here; you
might want to smell that-

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.498 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What is it?

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:01.901 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is a very...this
grows above the snow line,

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:04.704 align:middle line:84%
in other words the snow never
melts, and it is a root,

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.707 align:middle line:84%
and that is just a chunk of the
root, you can give it a whiff.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.409 align:middle line:90%
You'll see how strong that is.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
It is potent is it not?

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.344 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It is wonderful.

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:12.612 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: And this plant,

00:20:12.612 --> 00:20:15.281 align:middle line:84%
the weather changes sixty
degrees approximately

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:16.816 align:middle line:90%
on a typical day to night,

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.585 align:middle line:84%
and so its adaptability
is incredible,

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:25.124 align:middle line:84%
and the flat name is rhodiola
sacra; the sacra meant sacred.

00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:27.326 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet it is one of
the three sacred herbs,

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
it is actually used by
the spiritual seekers,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.965 align:middle line:84%
they would grind this into
powder and either take it,

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.735 align:middle line:84%
or extract it, and
then the monks would go

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:36.903 align:middle line:90%
up to the mountain and meditate

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:40.206 align:middle line:84%
for their meditation
periods from time to time.

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:43.209 align:middle line:84%
Now the sherpas take it
to go up for air sickness,

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:48.214 align:middle line:84%
because when you take this
herb, it pretty much close

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:51.651 align:middle line:84%
to doubles the amount of
oxygen reaching your brain

00:20:51.651 --> 00:20:53.219 align:middle line:84%
in about ten minutes
after taking it,

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:56.055 align:middle line:84%
and so it is pretty much like
putting an oxygen mask on,

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:90%
or like taking an oxygen bar-

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.925 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness!

00:20:58.925 --> 00:20:59.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that is
a very, you would,

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.561 align:middle line:90%
even sniffing it a couple times,

00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:03.763 align:middle line:84%
you have actually increased
the oxygen in your body.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That works for me!

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.165 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is a really
remarkable,

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:08.901 align:middle line:84%
it is a famous brain tonic,
it is also really good

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:13.206 align:middle line:84%
for your heart, and then goji
is the last one I really have

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.207 align:middle line:90%
to mention.

00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:15.842 align:middle line:84%
There are a few others
I would take,

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
but goji is the most important
gin tonic in the world.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.415 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people take
goji I am sure,

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:25.818 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people watching today
have tasted goji in the market

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:30.723 align:middle line:84%
but I do not know if they have
tasted goji of this quality.

00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:33.326 align:middle line:84%
You know there are different
qualities of every herb,

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the range is gigantic, that
is, just been my fun in my life

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.165 align:middle line:84%
to actually go and
actually find,

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
you know I keep saying I want
the best, I want the best,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.338 align:middle line:84%
and I pressure people and we get
the best there is in the world,

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:51.043 align:middle line:84%
and goji is almost a
miraculous Jing restorative.

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:53.946 align:middle line:84%
The Jing is that primal
energy that we use,

00:21:53.946 --> 00:21:56.916 align:middle line:84%
that determines our life span,
and the power of our life,

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:58.618 align:middle line:84%
and we use up that
energy living,

00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and it is like our battery.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.489 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what they say
about it being an antioxidant

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.291 align:middle line:84%
and other thing, those are
not the important things

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:08.594 align:middle line:84%
with the fact of restorative
Jing, so powerfully

00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:12.465 align:middle line:84%
and so quickly, and so a
handful a day keeps your Jing,

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:13.699 align:middle line:90%
your battery, charged.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:14.867 align:middle line:90%
And this is-

00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:16.302 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That is it,
just a handful a day

00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:18.571 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is right,
and so this is called,

00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:20.139 align:middle line:84%
this is the best
grade in the world.

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:23.409 align:middle line:84%
It grows on glacial melt,
only that is all it is,

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:25.645 align:middle line:84%
it is at the base of the
second highest mountain range

00:22:25.645 --> 00:22:27.313 align:middle line:84%
in the world, it is
called Heaven Mountain.

00:22:27.313 --> 00:22:29.015 align:middle line:84%
It melts there, the
glaciers melt,

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.451 align:middle line:84%
this thirty thousand
year old glacier melts

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:35.555 align:middle line:84%
and irrigates this place and
that is what these, taste them-

00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:38.057 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This is really
the most beautiful;

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:39.992 align:middle line:90%
it is not dried up like ISBC

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:42.228 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: No, we package
them there,

00:22:42.228 --> 00:22:44.463 align:middle line:90%
so that they do not, before they

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:47.166 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: They taste like raisins,
this is the sweetest goji-

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:48.401 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah.

00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:50.503 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I have never tasted,
it is not bitter at all.

00:22:50.503 --> 00:22:51.671 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: No, that is right.

00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:52.939 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: They are not
supposed to be, are they?

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:54.407 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: No, This is
the real thing

00:22:54.407 --> 00:22:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: They are very sweet

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:57.577 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah, and it is natural.

00:22:57.577 --> 00:23:00.613 align:middle line:84%
There have now been
companies, people have thought,

00:23:00.613 --> 00:23:02.815 align:middle line:84%
oh you must sweeten them and
so they actually sent them

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:05.918 align:middle line:84%
out to labs to see if we,
you know, sweetened them

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:07.987 align:middle line:84%
but they all came back
and said Oh my God,

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:09.188 align:middle line:90%
that's actually natural.

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:11.657 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Do they have a high
sugar content in them?

00:23:11.657 --> 00:23:14.227 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Glucose, fructose
and those thing,

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:16.229 align:middle line:90%
but you know it is funny,

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:21.567 align:middle line:84%
in goji is the most commonly
used herb for diabetes in China.

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.236 align:middle line:84%
We do not, and I'm
not even close

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:25.071 align:middle line:84%
to saying it's used
to treat that.

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:26.339 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.307 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It seems to be
metabolized in a very good way.

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:31.143 align:middle line:84%
You know you do not want
to eat too much of anything

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
in the world, like
everything is about balance.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.448 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But it is in a very
low glycemic category.

00:23:35.448 --> 00:23:38.317 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, and actually the
body uses it very efficiently

00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:42.255 align:middle line:84%
to regulate the system,
and for that purpose.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:46.092 align:middle line:84%
It is about, well they
are definitely delicious.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.126 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh they are

00:23:47.126 --> 00:23:49.829 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Surprisingly,
people would, yeah

00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.397 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so, we are
learning about a lot

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:84%
of different types
of herbs today.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.835 align:middle line:84%
One of the ones you have in
this beautiful picture is of,

00:23:55.835 --> 00:23:56.936 align:middle line:90%
this is the snow lotus?

00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:58.237 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, that
is the snow lotus

00:23:58.237 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And what is that?

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.708 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: There is two main
sources of snow lotus.

00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:07.046 align:middle line:84%
One is Tibet, you know, at the
snow line, both of them grow,

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:10.983 align:middle line:84%
you know you go up
about fifteen, sixteen,

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:14.253 align:middle line:90%
seventeen thousand feet, and all

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden the snow
never melts.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:16.889 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is where
you see the hymala-

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.724 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:20.359 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: The big mountains where
the snow is always there.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:24.697 align:middle line:84%
So snow lotus grows
right at the snow line,

00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:29.769 align:middle line:84%
and so it is always either
snowy, icy, or just there,

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:33.439 align:middle line:84%
and it is always the ground's
hard, and snow lotus is one

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of those huge adaptive,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.811 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the three sacred
herbs of the Himalayas.

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:84%
It is used to purify your
blood, and for beauty.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:43.983 align:middle line:90%
It used to be the present,

00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:48.154 align:middle line:84%
people from the Himalayas would
collect and they would take it

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:50.189 align:middle line:84%
to the Chinese Empress,
and that would be there,

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:51.557 align:middle line:90%
instead of silk or you know-

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:54.026 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So they would have to
climb to seventeen thousand feet

00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:55.861 align:middle line:84%
and get this beautiful
herb which is,

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.296 align:middle line:90%
good thing they find it up there

00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:58.798 align:middle line:84%
in case they need
it for circulation

00:24:58.798 --> 00:25:03.035 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That variety is
white; the other kind is

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:90%
from Heaven Mountain,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.838 align:middle line:84%
that mountain I said is
the second highest mountain

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:07.073 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.841 align:middle line:84%
That is where our goji grow,
but if you go up higher

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:11.777 align:middle line:84%
than the goji, up to the snow
line, then you get a red,

00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:13.512 align:middle line:90%
the white snow line is

00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:15.948 align:middle line:84%
from Tibet is considered
the best in the world.

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:18.484 align:middle line:84%
That is the kind, the
premium, and that is what,

00:25:18.484 --> 00:25:22.221 align:middle line:84%
actually once it is dry, this
is one that has been dried,

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that is the same thing
you're seeing on the screen

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.625 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You are kidding, what
are the health benefits of the-?

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:29.562 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It purifies your
blood, it is very purifying,

00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:90%
so it makes your skin beautiful,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.366 align:middle line:84%
because it takes away the
poison from your body.

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: The toxins

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.868 align:middle line:90%
>> And it is very adaptogenic

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:84%
and it is also considered
an aphrodesiac.

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:39.638 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, really?

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:41.607 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: All the tonic
herbs, they are going

00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:44.176 align:middle line:84%
to boost some basic
things, right-

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:46.579 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh, that is
wonderful, well, alright,

00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:49.682 align:middle line:84%
so we mentioned the gynostemma,
and we have a picture

00:25:49.682 --> 00:25:52.952 align:middle line:84%
of the gynostemma fields
here, now this is a place

00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:54.387 align:middle line:84%
that you traveled
to, where is this?

00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:56.555 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, that is
actually our plantation.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:26:03.629 align:middle line:84%
It has got beautifully and about
twenty years ago I was on a,

00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:09.902 align:middle line:84%
I was going to China,
and I got to the airport

00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:12.004 align:middle line:84%
and realized I had
forgotten my passport,

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:14.807 align:middle line:84%
so I had to run home really
quickly and I came back

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:17.076 align:middle line:84%
to the airport and they
had given my seat away.

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:20.146 align:middle line:84%
So, then they said, well I will
tell you what, they can seat you

00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:23.482 align:middle line:84%
in first class, so they bumped
me up to first class coach,

00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:26.752 align:middle line:84%
which is really a great
deal, and I sat next to,

00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:30.956 align:middle line:84%
by coincidence, sat next to a
man who saw what I was reading

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.057 align:middle line:84%
or something, and he
introduced himself

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:33.626 align:middle line:84%
and he was the commissioner
of drug approval

00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:37.997 align:middle line:84%
for the people's republic of
China, and after getting to talk

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:39.932 align:middle line:84%
to him for a few minutes
because he spoke great English,

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I reached
into my bag and I pulled

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:45.371 align:middle line:84%
out an article he had
written, this guy next to me-

00:26:45.371 --> 00:26:46.739 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:48.741 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: On the anti-aging herbs
of China, that was the name

00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:53.479 align:middle line:84%
of the article, and it was all,
you know, yellowed, and notes

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:57.082 align:middle line:84%
and everything, so obviously
he became instantly bonded

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:59.685 align:middle line:90%
to this guy he just met.

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:00.953 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You.

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:03.322 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: He became a great
teacher of mine for a long time;

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:05.758 align:middle line:90%
he was in all of China.

00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:10.729 align:middle line:84%
But the second trip to China I
asked him, what is a new herb

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:13.098 align:middle line:84%
that is really going
to be great,

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:16.302 align:middle line:84%
that is the most awesome herb,
a tonic herb, anti-aging herb,

00:27:16.302 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:84%
so he said you have got
to check into gynostemma,

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:84%
they are just learning
how to cultivate it,

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:24.343 align:middle line:84%
and so we got this, we
met this through him,

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:28.881 align:middle line:84%
a couple other people, we
actually asked somebody

00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:31.484 align:middle line:84%
if they would grow us
gynostemma in a virgin ground,

00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in a mountain, and they actually
picked the place, [inaudible],

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.057 align:middle line:84%
authentic area where it
really grows, and they went up

00:27:38.057 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and they actually cut this
little valley out for us,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.628 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:43.729 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Planted this, so
there has never been anything

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:45.564 align:middle line:90%
but nature grown here before,

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:49.502 align:middle line:84%
and so this plantation
was be growing it

00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:53.939 align:middle line:84%
for about eighteen years,
and it is gynostemma,

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.841 align:middle line:84%
one of the great herbs
in the world, yeah.

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:58.077 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And the properties
of gynostemma?

00:27:58.077 --> 00:28:01.113 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, gynostemma
has chemistry very similar

00:28:01.113 --> 00:28:02.281 align:middle line:90%
to ginseng.

00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:04.984 align:middle line:84%
It is called miracle
grass in china

00:28:04.984 --> 00:28:07.353 align:middle line:84%
because it grows very
quickly, so it is much cheaper

00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:10.189 align:middle line:84%
than ginseng, but it has
the same kind of chemistry,

00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:13.759 align:middle line:84%
the same adaptogenic herb the
chemicals, they call sapinins,

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.427 align:middle line:90%
it actually has got more.

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:18.097 align:middle line:84%
And so the people that
live in this area,

00:28:18.097 --> 00:28:20.132 align:middle line:84%
they are the longest
living people in the world,

00:28:20.132 --> 00:28:22.635 align:middle line:84%
there is more oxygen per
capita than any place.

00:28:22.635 --> 00:28:25.671 align:middle line:84%
And these people, they still
smoke or do their stuff,

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:28.807 align:middle line:84%
but they still live longer
than those who everybody else.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:31.243 align:middle line:84%
It is because they drink
this tea every single day,

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:35.814 align:middle line:84%
this thing here, so we just made
a copy of the key they make,

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:84%
it is called spring
dragon tea, and-

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.218 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You put it in-

00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, I drink it, you
asked what do I drink every day,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.523 align:middle line:84%
I said gynostemma, but I
actually take my gynostemma

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:46.358 align:middle line:84%
as spring garden tea, because
that is how they have been doing

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:49.695 align:middle line:84%
it there for centuries, so
basically this is a tea bag.

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Can you put this
with the schisandra powder?

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:54.733 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: I say, why not?

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.236 align:middle line:84%
Key, so usually that is
exactly what you would do.

00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:58.404 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, OK

00:28:58.404 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Now this is a
tea, usually you have tea

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:02.841 align:middle line:84%
with a hotter water, with
schisandra powder you can have,

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
but I mix things, you know the
tonic herbs, I am not going

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:09.214 align:middle line:84%
to settle for one, those things,
all those things I mentioned

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:11.383 align:middle line:84%
that I take every day;
I probably take them

00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:15.554 align:middle line:84%
in one swallow from
different things that I have.

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:19.325 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Alright, so now this
is a beautiful close picture

00:29:19.325 --> 00:29:21.627 align:middle line:84%
of the gynostemma leaf
in this particular field.

00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:25.097 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: See, that is much better
than the ones I grew myself.

00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:29.201 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot growing, you would
be amazed, I have a hill side

00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:32.605 align:middle line:84%
of this growing, but this is the
place where it is being grown,

00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:36.475 align:middle line:84%
where thousands or millions
of years and it just grows

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:40.579 align:middle line:84%
so strong and so beautiful
and you know, you go there

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:43.682 align:middle line:84%
and it is like, when you go
there you have to watch out for,

00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:45.017 align:middle line:84%
the big issue is
when you are going

00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:84%
out into the fields
you have to watch

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.086 align:middle line:90%
for leopards and wild boars.

00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, there is no
road going to the field,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.694 align:middle line:84%
it is just like little mountain
walks and things like that.

00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:58.998 align:middle line:84%
There is a guy that
works on this plantation,

00:29:58.998 --> 00:30:00.399 align:middle line:84%
we are not making him
work like a sweat shop,

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:01.734 align:middle line:90%
but he is a hundred years old

00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That was picked this
morning; Oh my goodness.

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.903 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: He still wants to go out
to the field from the village,

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:07.473 align:middle line:84%
so he goes out every
day and helps tend it

00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:10.943 align:middle line:84%
and it is just beautiful,
it is just great

00:30:10.943 --> 00:30:13.178 align:middle line:84%
to be a tonic herbalist
to say the least

00:30:13.178 --> 00:30:14.446 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, no kidding.

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:16.081 align:middle line:84%
So there is so much knowledge
you have about these,

00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:19.218 align:middle line:84%
let us talk a little
bit about what is

00:30:19.218 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
on the table here, this is the-

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: This is a red
mushroom, it is rare,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean I do not think
anybody has it

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:30.062 align:middle line:84%
in the United States really,
but it only grows in one place,

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:32.231 align:middle line:84%
it is wild, it only grows in
one place, it is the same place

00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:37.002 align:middle line:84%
that the gynostemma comes from,
and if you put it into water,

00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.404 align:middle line:90%
maybe we can use this water.

00:30:38.404 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:84%
I know it is just sitting here,
but you put it in this water,

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:45.444 align:middle line:84%
if it was hot water it would
go faster, but you put it in,

00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and after about, we'll just let
it sit we can come back to it

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.183 align:middle line:84%
in a few minutes, but
it is going to turn red.

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:55.754 align:middle line:84%
And by coincidence this is an
amazing blood tonic, so women,

00:30:55.754 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the big issues
in the human life is

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.859 align:middle line:84%
that women lose blood
every month,

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:04.296 align:middle line:84%
or if they do not then you
need to build your blood,

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:07.332 align:middle line:84%
so women need to be drinking
blood tonics all the time,

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:08.834 align:middle line:84%
things that help
enrich their blood.

00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
To re-boost trillions of
blood cells a day almost.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.406 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, it
probably works better.

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:16.842 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You can see
that already, yeah

00:31:16.842 --> 00:31:19.211 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That red pigment
in reality,

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:22.414 align:middle line:84%
if it was hot water this
would turn bright red,

00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:27.319 align:middle line:84%
stunningly blood red and by
nature's coincidence it becomes,

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:30.689 align:middle line:84%
it actually rapidly
increases blood count.

00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So, especially after your period
for like three, four, five days,

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.596 align:middle line:84%
you are supposed to
take these red mushrooms

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:39.264 align:middle line:90%
and they are very precious.

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And they cannot figure
out how they grow them,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.102 align:middle line:90%
so they cannot cultivate them.

00:31:43.102 --> 00:31:43.902 align:middle line:90%
All they do is-

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:45.437 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Pick them in the wild

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:47.072 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Pick them
in the wild, yeah.

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:48.841 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
beautiful that is-

00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:49.875 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow, that is amazing

00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:51.276 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And that is
just in cold water.

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.847 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: When you say that they
are rare, they are hard to find?

00:31:54.847 --> 00:31:56.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah.

00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:59.051 align:middle line:84%
This one, there is not much
produced, and I just heard

00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:02.554 align:middle line:84%
about it when I went on my
trip to get the gynostemma.

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:06.325 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the local people
selling them at certain times

00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:10.129 align:middle line:84%
of the year and then I,
what I do, what is it?

00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:12.664 align:middle line:84%
And I got the translation
that it is a blood tonic-

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:13.599 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.333 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Really strong
blood tonic.

00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:16.068 align:middle line:90%
Then they cook them too.

00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:19.838 align:middle line:84%
One you saw, they will be soft
mushrooms and you can put them

00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:21.673 align:middle line:84%
in salads, soups
or anything else.

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:22.941 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness, wow

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:23.742 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And that is a great
way to take a blood tonic.

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:24.576 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:26.078 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Your cheeks turn rosy;

00:32:26.078 --> 00:32:30.849 align:middle line:84%
you actually get another half
a pint of blood or something

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:32.084 align:middle line:90%
from doing that once a month.

00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:33.485 align:middle line:90%
And look how beautiful that is

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:36.755 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Turns red so fast, by the
end of the show, and then the,

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.958 align:middle line:84%
you can tell that the
mushrooms are starting to.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.095 align:middle line:84%
So when a mushroom dries
or the reishi dries,

00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:45.798 align:middle line:84%
it does not lose any of its
properties to the drying

00:32:45.798 --> 00:32:47.065 align:middle line:90%
after you have picked it?

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.768 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: No, I do not think
anybody gets these things.

00:32:49.768 --> 00:32:54.206 align:middle line:84%
The whole legacy of these
herbs is dried, you know,

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:56.141 align:middle line:84%
because people are
going up to the mountain

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.843 align:middle line:90%
and they are bringing them down,

00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.611 align:middle line:84%
and then they dry
them to protect them.

00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:02.047 align:middle line:84%
Cause if you take a mushroom
and you did not let it dry,

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:84%
it would get all funky
really, you know, the next day.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.286 align:middle line:84%
So they put it out in
the sun and they dry it.

00:33:07.286 --> 00:33:09.321 align:middle line:84%
And then that is what is
become the herbal lure,

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.824 align:middle line:90%
based on the dried version.

00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:12.391 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:13.725 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, I see

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:17.262 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Now that does not mean
you cannot take it fresh,

00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:20.766 align:middle line:84%
you know, like, but I do not
think there is much change

00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:22.434 align:middle line:90%
in the potency.

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:25.337 align:middle line:84%
They've learned how
to dry them properly,

00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:90%
and they do not over dry them.

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:29.641 align:middle line:84%
Like, the gynostemma,
it's a green leafy thing,

00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:84%
but it would turn into
compost if we did not dry it.

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:38.383 align:middle line:84%
SO they put it in little baskets
and they dry it for a few days.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:42.354 align:middle line:84%
And our goji, you know, like
we used to try to get it moist

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:44.857 align:middle line:90%
like this and put it into bags.

00:33:44.857 --> 00:33:46.124 align:middle line:90%
It rotted.

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.861 align:middle line:84%
So we had to get a
special bag that was sealed

00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:50.262 align:middle line:90%
in a certain kind of way,

00:33:50.262 --> 00:33:54.933 align:middle line:84%
and it is just the porousness
became very very low, so that.

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:56.335 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting

00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:58.102 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: So it protected it from
spoiling, but once you open them

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:00.004 align:middle line:84%
because they are
wet, they're moist.

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:02.073 align:middle line:84%
Then you got to sort
of eat them in a week.

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:03.207 align:middle line:90%
Ever refrigerate it.

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:06.144 align:middle line:84%
Not real fast, but you
cannot wait like that.

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you shoot the
market, they are very dry.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.416 align:middle line:90%
Those have been so overly dry,

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:16.254 align:middle line:84%
but it created shelf
life, those are too dry.

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.689 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That is why those
tasted like raisins yeah,

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.526 align:middle line:90%
and they were soft like raisins.

00:34:20.526 --> 00:34:22.895 align:middle line:84%
Alright, now we have a
picture here of cordyceps.

00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And they are natural?

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.799 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah, that is cordyceps.

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Glutenease cordyceps.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.174 align:middle line:84%
Cordyceps of course is, it is a
weird thing, it is a mushroom.

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:39.645 align:middle line:84%
That is a hundred percent
mushroom, but it was a fungus,

00:34:39.645 --> 00:34:42.214 align:middle line:84%
the mushroom comes down and
puts a spore into the body

00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:45.784 align:middle line:84%
of a caterpillar, and it retains
the shape of the caterpillar,

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:47.853 align:middle line:84%
but it is converted
into a mushroom.

00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:51.423 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh, I was wondering why
they look like caterpillars.

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.058 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, they look like
it, they will fake you out.

00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:54.293 align:middle line:84%
They look just like
a caterpillar,

00:34:54.293 --> 00:34:56.128 align:middle line:84%
but they are a hundred
percent vegetarian

00:34:56.128 --> 00:34:59.364 align:middle line:84%
because they have been converted
into- In nature, and these are

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:03.368 align:middle line:84%
at the snow line also, these
are about a hundred feet lower

00:35:03.368 --> 00:35:04.603 align:middle line:90%
than the rhodiola though.

00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:07.406 align:middle line:84%
These are collected
just below the snowline

00:35:07.406 --> 00:35:10.509 align:middle line:84%
where rhodiola was just
above it, but they are also-

00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:13.245 align:middle line:84%
At night it snows, and
in the day it melts,

00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
so you know it is
like- And this is one

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.517 align:middle line:84%
of the most precious
tonic herbs in the world.

00:35:18.517 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Cordyceps is the most expensive
herb in the world right now;

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:90%
it is literally selling

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.724 align:middle line:84%
for about forty million
dollars a ton right now.

00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:27.326 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What, why is that?

00:35:27.326 --> 00:35:28.727 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: It has just gone up.

00:35:28.727 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it is considered to be a
super over the top adaptogenic.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It's super over the
top protective

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.341 align:middle line:84%
for your immune system, and
it's considered longevity

00:35:42.341 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:90%
and anti-aging herb.

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.243 align:middle line:84%
And then it is considered
to be one

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.546 align:middle line:84%
of the major aphrodisiac
herbs of China.

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:49.748 align:middle line:84%
They know a few things
about some aphrodisiacs.

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:50.615 align:middle line:90%
>> RG: Of course.

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.717 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: It is very precious

00:35:51.717 --> 00:35:53.151 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now here is a
picture of what it looks

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.253 align:middle line:84%
like in the spring,
it's really beautiful.

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.221 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah, that is right

00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:57.422 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: In April

00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:59.524 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is how it was
when they pulled it up.

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:00.626 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And now?

00:36:00.626 --> 00:36:03.161 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Oh, that is the
mushroom coming out.

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Under the ground is
the little wormy guy,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.033 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had a picture here.

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:08.834 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: He was right there.

00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:09.534 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: There they are.

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:10.802 align:middle line:90%
>> LG:: Here they are .

00:36:10.802 --> 00:36:13.105 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: : These are from...these
broke off a little bit,

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:14.673 align:middle line:90%
they are not perfect anymore.

00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:17.042 align:middle line:84%
Because we extract
everything over there.

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:19.111 align:middle line:84%
It is a lot better to
get it done properly.

00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:22.714 align:middle line:84%
But you can just see it; I do
not know if you can see it,

00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:25.751 align:middle line:84%
it does look just like
a...and the Bhutanese ones have

00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:27.252 align:middle line:90%
red eyes.

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.353 align:middle line:90%
That is why I was knowing that-

00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:30.122 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Looked like it-

00:36:30.122 --> 00:36:33.225 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: But the blue ones have
black eyes, they're the same-

00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: But...basically it
has a mushroom that comes off

00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:37.396 align:middle line:84%
and then the fruiting
body, and it is all good,

00:36:37.396 --> 00:36:39.097 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing is worth a lot.

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:40.432 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is amazing.

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:41.867 align:middle line:84%
Now what about when you see
the cordyceps in the market

00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:43.201 align:middle line:90%
in the capsules that are white.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.603 align:middle line:90%
What, do those?

00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:46.605 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Now that is different.

00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:49.241 align:middle line:90%
That is what they call mycelium.

00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:51.276 align:middle line:84%
That is where they
actually grew it in a tank.

00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:56.648 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like, it would be
like kind of like a mash,

00:36:56.648 --> 00:36:58.283 align:middle line:90%
a little bit like dog food.

00:36:58.283 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And they put it in there, then
they put the- And it turns

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.224 align:middle line:84%
into a fungal mass, and it
just becomes a fungal mass.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It is a biotechnology process.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very good substance,
and I do approve of it,

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.432 align:middle line:84%
but it is not the
same as the wild.

00:37:13.432 --> 00:37:16.802 align:middle line:84%
You can get wild, and you can
get nowadays, you can get wild,

00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:22.441 align:middle line:84%
and you can get semi-wild, and
then you can get the mycelium,

00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:23.675 align:middle line:90%
which is the white kind.

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:24.543 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I see

00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:26.344 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Which is much cheaper.

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:27.679 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK, that makes sense.

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:30.115 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is what it
comes down to, to go,

00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:33.752 align:middle line:84%
I cannot go to collect cordyceps
because they have to train,

00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:36.188 align:middle line:84%
you have to train to
go up to that altitude

00:37:36.188 --> 00:37:37.089 align:middle line:90%
because you cannot breathe.

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:37.923 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Sure .

00:37:37.923 --> 00:37:39.858 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: It is three miles up.

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:41.326 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK, now I understand why.

00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:42.527 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah.

00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:44.129 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, we have a
video of you here of you,

00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:84%
and the audio is a little
bit different, heard to hear

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.201 align:middle line:84%
on this one, but
take a look at this.

00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:53.472 align:middle line:84%
And this is Ron, in a
traditional Chinese factory

00:37:53.472 --> 00:37:55.173 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, well this
is very traditional

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:56.808 align:middle line:84%
if this is what I think
you are going to show.

00:37:56.808 --> 00:37:58.276 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, take a look.

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:00.078 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: That is twenty years ago,

00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:04.783 align:middle line:84%
and so this is how
things used to be.

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.887 align:middle line:84%
Things used to be cooked in a
pot, and this is of course just,

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:13.391 align:middle line:84%
this is a small workshop at
the Fojo traditional factory.

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:17.896 align:middle line:84%
And I was just- That
though happens

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:19.831 align:middle line:84%
to have sixteen major
tonic herbs in it.

00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:21.767 align:middle line:90%
I know I am going to talk some

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:23.435 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow

00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:27.105 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: But that is very very old
fashioned, I know, first I want

00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:29.941 align:middle line:84%
to give a preface to everybody,
that this is not what it is

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
like now, and we will
see that in a second.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.846 align:middle line:84%
But this is how they used to
make the tea, they would stir it

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:38.416 align:middle line:84%
and cook it in a pot, and I
think what I am explaining here,

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.651 align:middle line:90%
and you can go onto my website

00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:40.919 align:middle line:84%
and probably hear what
I am really saying.

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:42.621 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just explaining
the three treasures

00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:44.623 align:middle line:84%
and how this is the
ultimate adaptogenics.

00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:46.958 align:middle line:84%
I was actually, this
was a prototype

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:49.794 align:middle line:90%
for a formula we were making,

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:52.297 align:middle line:84%
and I just found this video
recently, so it's kind of-

00:38:52.297 --> 00:38:54.166 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That is great,
that is really great.

00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:57.169 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, it is what you
would do in your own house,

00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:59.004 align:middle line:84%
but it is not what
we would do anymore.

00:38:59.004 --> 00:39:00.238 align:middle line:90%
But it is beautiful.

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It is still being
done in China though, right?

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.344 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: This is really
very heartland of China.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:09.848 align:middle line:90%
That is very much China.

00:39:09.848 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And you would not see that here.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.752 align:middle line:90%
Long time ago

00:39:13.752 --> 00:39:15.353 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And there are sixteen
different herbs in there?

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.755 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: There are sixteen herbs.

00:39:16.755 --> 00:39:20.659 align:middle line:84%
That was a formula I made for
a multilevel marketing company.

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:23.528 align:middle line:90%
It was called Emperor's Chi.

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:24.829 align:middle line:90%
Actually was very successful.

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.766 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now is this,
do you have to keep it

00:39:27.766 --> 00:39:29.668 align:middle line:90%
in motion, the stirring process?

00:39:29.668 --> 00:39:31.703 align:middle line:84%
>>RT: Yeah, well it would stick
to the side, but you know,

00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:36.007 align:middle line:84%
you just stir it, you know,
that is the old fashioned way,

00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:39.611 align:middle line:84%
that is probably the way they
did it for thousands of years.

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:41.713 align:middle line:90%
Made the pot of tea.

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:43.682 align:middle line:84%
At home now if I was
to cook some stuff up,

00:39:43.682 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I would still sit there,
and you know, like-

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.351 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Stir it.

00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:47.919 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Like stirring soup
or something like that,

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:50.789 align:middle line:84%
and you want all the
herbs to come out,

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:53.825 align:middle line:84%
and you do not want things
to harden at the edge,

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:55.794 align:middle line:84%
but anyway that is
an old fashioned.

00:39:55.794 --> 00:39:57.762 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now you are
making a tonic out of this?

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:00.732 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, they would actually
take this...once it is done they

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:03.969 align:middle line:84%
would screen it, you
know, and drain it,

00:40:03.969 --> 00:40:06.571 align:middle line:84%
and then they would put
it into a little teeny,

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:08.139 align:middle line:84%
because we are making
a prototype,

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.775 align:middle line:84%
a little spray dry
machine that would dry it

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.210 align:middle line:90%
into a powder again, and then

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:16.381 align:middle line:84%
that would be something we
would, in this particular case,

00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:18.316 align:middle line:84%
we still make the
exact same formula,

00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:19.651 align:middle line:90%
it is called super adaptogen,

00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:22.287 align:middle line:84%
I still sell the same
thing twenty years later,

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:23.388 align:middle line:90%
but it is a capsule.

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:26.658 align:middle line:84%
Much more sophisti-
the technology has,

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:29.527 align:middle line:84%
the reason this video, I put
it up on the web was to show

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.029 align:middle line:90%
where things have come from.

00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:32.964 align:middle line:84%
You know, my blessing
was I started to go

00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:35.533 align:middle line:90%
to China before it boomed.

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:38.169 align:middle line:84%
You know? Before
it became modern.

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:42.841 align:middle line:84%
It was, when I got there, it was
so old fashioned and so archaic

00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:45.310 align:middle line:90%
and the way it has been,

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
then right before my eyes
it became technologically.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.283 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, it took time,
but started getting investment

00:40:51.283 --> 00:40:54.185 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world, and then
became a powerhouse of its own.

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:59.958 align:middle line:84%
And so this old fashioned
scene, you will never see again.

00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.159 align:middle line:90%
It is not how they do it.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:03.795 align:middle line:84%
Now the technology, every,
the extraction tanks,

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.330 align:middle line:90%
at least the ones we use I know-

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.165 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I have a picture of, yeah

00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:08.566 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Are computer
driven, you know,

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
everything is computer driven,
to actually go in and work

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.106 align:middle line:84%
in there, you are practically
wearing a hazmat outfit,

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:17.042 align:middle line:90%
they are extremely clean.

00:41:17.042 --> 00:41:20.745 align:middle line:84%
I do not think we are
going to see them today,

00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:24.282 align:middle line:84%
but the take is all these
factories are, everybody,

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:26.685 align:middle line:84%
they have workers constantly
cleaning everything,

00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:29.154 align:middle line:90%
it is very very clean.

00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:30.889 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this, these
factories, we picked them

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
because they were
near water sources

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.193 align:middle line:84%
where the water is the
purest in the world.

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:37.262 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: These factories
are in China?

00:41:37.262 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: This is China.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.464 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Is your factory?

00:41:39.464 --> 00:41:40.432 align:middle line:90%
The one here?

00:41:40.432 --> 00:41:41.399 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, well
I do not own it,

00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:43.735 align:middle line:84%
but we contract exclusively
with it.

00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:46.371 align:middle line:84%
We have four factories
that we do everything at,

00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.642 align:middle line:84%
and yeah this is, you know,
you can see shiny it is.

00:41:50.642 --> 00:41:52.177 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: How clean.

00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, we take you
know, a pride in that,

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.084 align:middle line:84%
and that is important
because not every factory

00:41:59.084 --> 00:42:00.885 align:middle line:90%
in the world is like that.

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And now what is the point

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.055 align:middle line:84%
of the cleanliness,
I mean obviously to

00:42:04.055 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: I mean, you know,
you do not want...you know,

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.794 align:middle line:84%
this is the most, you know like
I sometimes think people are

00:42:09.794 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in technologies like computers
or cell phones, you know,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.734 align:middle line:84%
and it is like high
technology, and you are dealing

00:42:15.734 --> 00:42:17.836 align:middle line:84%
with people's lives, you know
finding people and do all kinds

00:42:17.836 --> 00:42:20.271 align:middle line:84%
of things, but these herbs
you actually, you take them,

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:24.876 align:middle line:84%
I take them, I have got
thousands, tens of thousands

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:27.045 align:middle line:84%
of people that take
our dragon herbs.

00:42:27.045 --> 00:42:29.848 align:middle line:84%
And I am responsible for them
living long, and you know,

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:32.584 align:middle line:84%
and these herbs, I go to
really a lot of trouble,

00:42:32.584 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I am putting my whole life
into collecting the best herbs.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.156 align:middle line:84%
I want them to come out of
the tank, go into the tank,

00:42:38.156 --> 00:42:41.393 align:middle line:84%
and come out so good
that it is over the top.

00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:42.594 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:42:42.594 --> 00:42:43.995 align:middle line:84%
And then, so to do that
you have to have a factory

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:47.499 align:middle line:84%
that has got the, what do
you call it, oil traps,

00:42:47.499 --> 00:42:48.933 align:middle line:90%
when the vapors go up.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:52.303 align:middle line:84%
This factory, that first factory
you can practically smell

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.438 align:middle line:90%
the stuff.

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:55.407 align:middle line:84%
That stuff is going up
to atmosphere, you see?

00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But these days, now it is all
collected in these oil traps

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.545 align:middle line:84%
and it crystallizes, and
then they put the crystals

00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:03.081 align:middle line:84%
of the aromatic oils
back into the thing.

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.582 align:middle line:90%
It is like perfect.

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.384 align:middle line:84%
That is what I am
saying, it is better

00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:09.654 align:middle line:84%
to take these extracts now then
to actual cook them yourself.

00:43:09.654 --> 00:43:13.491 align:middle line:84%
It would seem surprising, but
it- The better the technology,

00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:15.727 align:middle line:84%
the more natural the
end products become,

00:43:15.727 --> 00:43:19.297 align:middle line:84%
and you can see this
is the factory

00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:21.232 align:middle line:90%
where we make our FIT tea.

00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:26.204 align:middle line:84%
The tea that turned into
automatically this schisandra.

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:30.308 align:middle line:84%
This is, these, there are
no heaters in this factory,

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:31.342 align:middle line:90%
they don't heat the water.

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:33.478 align:middle line:84%
It is all done in,
but these pressures.

00:43:33.478 --> 00:43:34.579 align:middle line:90%
So these are the tanks.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:36.314 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And where does
the water come from?

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:39.818 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It comes from a
mountain, and it is nearby.

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:43.088 align:middle line:84%
It is an actual mountain spring,
and that is, and they will,

00:43:43.088 --> 00:43:44.589 align:middle line:90%
you know, filter it again.

00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But all the really, Chinese
are very savvy and Koreans

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.697 align:middle line:84%
and the people worried
about the water that goes

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:55.733 align:middle line:84%
in to make things, and,
you know, not everything

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:56.868 align:middle line:90%
in the world is perfect.

00:43:56.868 --> 00:43:58.536 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of dirty
things out there, but-

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:00.438 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: A lot of bacteria.

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:03.074 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: I go to hundreds and
hundreds of factories looking

00:44:03.074 --> 00:44:06.144 align:middle line:84%
for the best ones, you know,
I have gone to that many.

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:08.713 align:middle line:84%
It has been, a good part of
my life has been wasted going

00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:10.448 align:middle line:90%
to factories that were not good,

00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:12.350 align:middle line:84%
they did not have the right
water or the right filters

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.751 align:middle line:90%
and the right oil traps.

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:16.521 align:middle line:84%
And luckily we have
landed on great things.

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:18.957 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see how,
once again, how clean

00:44:18.957 --> 00:44:23.828 align:middle line:84%
and how technologically advanced
this is in the world actually.

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:25.497 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You have done a
lot of research on this.

00:44:25.497 --> 00:44:28.867 align:middle line:84%
Now this particular
picture, what is in this vat?

00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:31.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: That is the actual tank.

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.471 align:middle line:90%
That is, well, let us see,

00:44:33.471 --> 00:44:35.807 align:middle line:84%
the main silver thing
there, that is the tank.

00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They would actually, there is
a hole at the top, a trap door,

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.046 align:middle line:84%
and you would just pour, you
know, the herbs go into there

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.748 align:middle line:90%
and it goes down another floor.

00:44:43.748 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So it is like two stories tall
and it cooks, and then it goes

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.757 align:middle line:84%
down at the end of the day, it
all goes down to another tank

00:44:52.757 --> 00:44:56.528 align:middle line:84%
where they condense it
and they spray dry it.

00:44:56.528 --> 00:45:00.865 align:middle line:84%
They dry it in the
flash drying technology

00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:02.367 align:middle line:90%
that makes it into powder.

00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:04.202 align:middle line:90%
And then you take a capsule.

00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh my goodness,
that is fascinating.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.574 align:middle line:84%
So when it spray dries it
goes up and then it turns

00:45:09.574 --> 00:45:11.075 align:middle line:84%
into a powdery type
of substance?

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yes, spray
drying is really a-

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.813 align:middle line:90%
It is pretty miraculous to me.

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:19.751 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately my father-in-law,
Yin Ling's dad, his,

00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:23.588 align:middle line:84%
I did not know this when I met
her, it just became by luck

00:45:23.588 --> 00:45:26.558 align:middle line:84%
that he builds Chinese
herbal factories.

00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:27.926 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness

00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:30.361 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Can you believe that
one in a trillion lucky, well,

00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:33.031 align:middle line:84%
the one in you know
at least a billion,

00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:36.034 align:middle line:84%
but that is what
his profession was,

00:45:36.034 --> 00:45:38.036 align:middle line:84%
building Chinese
herbal factories.

00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:40.204 align:middle line:84%
So, I learned...that is
why I got good at this,

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:42.407 align:middle line:84%
I have got to admit it,
it was luck of the draw.

00:45:42.407 --> 00:45:44.576 align:middle line:84%
Get on the right air
plane and meet the guy

00:45:44.576 --> 00:45:46.377 align:middle line:90%
who can tell me everything, and-

00:45:46.377 --> 00:45:48.446 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well I am sure you
have been told by your masters

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:50.248 align:middle line:84%
that this is your
destiny that you are on.

00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:53.918 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: So these kind
of things, I go there,

00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:56.754 align:middle line:84%
but father-in-law goes and
inspects it and watches

00:45:56.754 --> 00:46:00.491 align:middle line:84%
over it all year long and
he is still, you know,

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:03.094 align:middle line:84%
the master of the
technology, and that is,

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.863 align:middle line:90%
you know, how lucky do I get?

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then you bring
it to us here in the US

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.302 align:middle line:84%
through these beautiful
emporiums and places

00:46:11.302 --> 00:46:14.372 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
display of these herbs,

00:46:14.372 --> 00:46:16.207 align:middle line:84%
people have a chance to
sample, to take these.

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:19.277 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, this is a look to
bar, at our Beverly Hills bar,

00:46:19.277 --> 00:46:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and just drink all kinds
of the different drinks.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.315 align:middle line:84%
Like you can see
these tonic wells,

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:90%
these bottles are all filled

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.885 align:middle line:84%
with different extracts
of the best.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.821 align:middle line:84%
So you can get reishi,
or you can get ginseng

00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:31.322 align:middle line:90%
or you can get ant extract,

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:34.459 align:middle line:84%
or chaga extract or
different things.

00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:35.827 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ant extract?

00:46:35.827 --> 00:46:39.397 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, ants grow, certain
kinds of mountain ant grows

00:46:39.397 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:84%
with the ginseng, they
come with the territory.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.936 align:middle line:84%
And they have the immune
system of the ginseng,

00:46:44.936 --> 00:46:47.271 align:middle line:84%
part of the immune
system, so ant is,

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:50.108 align:middle line:84%
they say ginseng is
the kind of herbs,

00:46:50.108 --> 00:46:52.110 align:middle line:90%
but ant is the herb of kings.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.144 align:middle line:90%
And you could just kind

00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:55.713 align:middle line:84%
of imagine the power
these things have.

00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:57.582 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You take the
extract of the ant?

00:46:57.582 --> 00:46:58.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah.

00:46:58.316 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.618 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is one of the
most popular things we have

00:47:00.618 --> 00:47:01.853 align:middle line:90%
and I do not know why.

00:47:01.853 --> 00:47:03.454 align:middle line:90%
I do not know why

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:05.723 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, I am wrapping
my head around that one

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:07.725 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: We can make
that show someday

00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:09.861 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about the deer
antler now that we are

00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:13.131 align:middle line:84%
on that track, it is not the
antler of the deer is it?

00:47:13.131 --> 00:47:15.233 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah it is, I
actually have some of it here.

00:47:15.233 --> 00:47:18.069 align:middle line:84%
Deer antler is one of the
great things in the world.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:20.672 align:middle line:84%
They do not hurt the deer,
they are highly protected,

00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:24.142 align:middle line:84%
they are very carefully
nurtured;

00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:27.245 align:middle line:90%
they are allowed to run wild.

00:47:27.245 --> 00:47:30.048 align:middle line:84%
But in the spring when the
deer antler is about this long,

00:47:30.048 --> 00:47:34.519 align:middle line:84%
about twelve inches long,
they cut the deer antler off,

00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:36.054 align:middle line:90%
then the deer live much longer.

00:47:36.054 --> 00:47:37.188 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Does it grow back?

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:39.424 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah they grow
back that season even.

00:47:39.424 --> 00:47:40.992 align:middle line:84%
The deer become much
less violent.

00:47:40.992 --> 00:47:43.661 align:middle line:84%
They are happier deer,
they tend to mate,

00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:46.864 align:middle line:84%
you know how one deer
usually gets all the girls.

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:47.799 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:49.801 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: In the forest, but in -

00:47:49.801 --> 00:47:50.935 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I do not know
that many deer.

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:52.136 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: But that is what happens.

00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:52.937 align:middle line:90%
They fight.

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:53.838 align:middle line:90%
You see them butting heads.

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:55.073 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:47:55.073 --> 00:47:56.274 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is because
when their antlers get big,

00:47:56.274 --> 00:47:59.744 align:middle line:84%
they will go to the best
guy gets the whole herem,

00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:03.581 align:middle line:84%
and in this situation, because
they cut the antlers off,

00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.952 align:middle line:84%
then they just become a
much more sharing family.

00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:09.053 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting

00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.755 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And it is kind
of, it is very good,

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:13.991 align:middle line:84%
and I know people argue
that we're using them,

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:17.695 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is, deer antler,
it contains, it grows like that

00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:19.997 align:middle line:90%
because it has got stem cells

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:22.934 align:middle line:84%
that are all available
in the last inch.

00:48:22.934 --> 00:48:24.702 align:middle line:84%
Most people sell the
whole deer antler,

00:48:24.702 --> 00:48:27.405 align:middle line:84%
most of the deer antler product,
but we take the last inch,

00:48:27.405 --> 00:48:29.574 align:middle line:84%
because that is where all
the growth is taking place,

00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.509 align:middle line:84%
and it is just loaded
with stem cells,

00:48:31.509 --> 00:48:33.311 align:middle line:90%
and those help us regenerate,

00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:34.445 align:middle line:84%
and that is why it
is considered one

00:48:34.445 --> 00:48:37.115 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
Jing tonic in the world,

00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:39.183 align:middle line:90%
for restoring your Jing.

00:48:39.183 --> 00:48:40.852 align:middle line:84%
And since they do
not hurt the deer,

00:48:40.852 --> 00:48:43.588 align:middle line:90%
and I have gone many many times.

00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:45.323 align:middle line:90%
It is OK.

00:48:45.323 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Are you sure?

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.191 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: I am sure.

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:48.392 align:middle line:84%
I have been there many
many, I have ridden

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:51.729 align:middle line:84%
on the backs, you
know I love deer.

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:53.231 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: If you think about
it, they are the ones,

00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:55.633 align:middle line:84%
the deer eat the herbs
all day long, I mean,

00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:56.768 align:middle line:90%
they are in the fields...

00:48:56.768 --> 00:49:00.438 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: The deer actually
eat reishi mushroom.

00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.973 align:middle line:84%
That is one of their
favorite things.

00:49:01.973 --> 00:49:03.407 align:middle line:90%
And they eat the ginseng.

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:07.278 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways ginseng
can die is deer find them,

00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:11.682 align:middle line:84%
deer are considered a higher
order animal, they are very,

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:15.853 align:middle line:84%
they give you spiritual power,
they're man's friend, they were,

00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:20.024 align:middle line:84%
I have art up by my many
pieces of art by my,

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:24.061 align:middle line:84%
of the God of longevity
and the spiritual Gods,

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:26.564 align:middle line:84%
with deer as their friend,
and I agree with that.

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:28.866 align:middle line:84%
I would not kill
a deer, you know,

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:31.736 align:middle line:84%
but I would let them share
their antler with me.

00:49:31.736 --> 00:49:35.673 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I see that a lot on the
different types of Chinese art,

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:37.608 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you see
the deer is there.

00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:40.178 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Representative of
longevity and well being,

00:49:40.178 --> 00:49:41.679 align:middle line:90%
and the deer do not suffer.

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:45.049 align:middle line:84%
It is, I could go into the
detail of what is happening,

00:49:45.049 --> 00:49:46.017 align:middle line:84%
but it is, they are
very protected.

00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:47.718 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: OK, well that
is good to know.

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:48.886 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: And yeah, and.

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:51.889 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So then is
there anything else

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.492 align:middle line:84%
that we have not covered,
the chaga mushroom.

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:57.595 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: I have a little
chunk of chaga here,

00:49:57.595 --> 00:49:59.130 align:middle line:90%
chaga comes from Siberia.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:04.602 align:middle line:84%
It comes from real north in
Siberia, and it is very similar

00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:06.137 align:middle line:90%
to the reishi mushroom.

00:50:06.137 --> 00:50:11.275 align:middle line:84%
There is many kinds of
hard woody mushrooms

00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:14.779 align:middle line:84%
that are very beneficial to
humans, and chaga just happens

00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:17.081 align:middle line:84%
to be one of those
ones that has a legacy

00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:21.586 align:middle line:84%
that has been established over
a very long time of protection.

00:50:21.586 --> 00:50:22.687 align:middle line:90%
You know, it protects.

00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:25.823 align:middle line:84%
People who take it,
it is very protective.

00:50:25.823 --> 00:50:27.792 align:middle line:84%
In terms and when I say
protective, I mean, you know,

00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:31.562 align:middle line:84%
those things that cause us to
age or to go out of balance.

00:50:31.562 --> 00:50:35.766 align:middle line:84%
Chaga and reishi, and there
is other ones like that,

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.235 align:middle line:90%
the cordyceps is a mushroom.

00:50:37.235 --> 00:50:42.006 align:middle line:84%
You know, the woody mushrooms
are very very powerful.

00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:43.374 align:middle line:84%
They make a very
big part of my life.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:46.677 align:middle line:84%
And I take probably five or
six different woody mushrooms.

00:50:46.677 --> 00:50:48.579 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And this turns into
a powder as well, right?

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:49.981 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, you can
turn it into a powder;

00:50:49.981 --> 00:50:54.986 align:middle line:84%
let me see if I have a
sample of it here, excuse me.

00:50:54.986 --> 00:50:59.690 align:middle line:84%
This one is, we just get
it, we have it extracted

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.993 align:middle line:84%
in a certain kind of way
at a certain temperature,

00:51:01.993 --> 00:51:04.328 align:middle line:84%
have it just right, then
you get all the ingredients.

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:06.731 align:middle line:84%
If it is too hot, too
cold, it does not- This is

00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:09.000 align:middle line:84%
from Siberia and
it is only wild.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.702 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And there is
also Siberian ginseng

00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:14.672 align:middle line:84%
and Panax ginseng and those
types of ginseng are based

00:51:14.672 --> 00:51:16.073 align:middle line:84%
on the regions that
they are from?

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:18.776 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, ginseng
comes from either,

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:22.647 align:middle line:84%
as far as we are concerned
it comes from, mountain.

00:51:22.647 --> 00:51:26.684 align:middle line:84%
Anything else in China
is inferior for sure.

00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:28.152 align:middle line:90%
Even the Chinese all know that.

00:51:28.152 --> 00:51:29.921 align:middle line:84%
It is like that is
what they would put,

00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:31.255 align:middle line:90%
just because of that chemistry.

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:35.092 align:middle line:84%
You cannot reproduce, even
if it does grow up, you know,

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:39.130 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of regions around it,
it is considered lower quality.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:84%
It is also great great great
ginseng grown in America.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:45.236 align:middle line:90%
In the Catskill Mountains.

00:51:45.236 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It is considered the equivalent
to Shanghai Mountain ginseng,

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.978 align:middle line:84%
and when it is wild, and
so the Chinese buy most

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:54.879 align:middle line:90%
of that from us.

00:51:54.879 --> 00:51:56.814 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact, it was-

00:51:56.814 --> 00:51:57.915 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:51:57.915 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It has been a
trade thing with China

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.418 align:middle line:90%
for five hundred years now,

00:52:00.418 --> 00:52:04.522 align:middle line:84%
so it is very important
that we use it a lot.

00:52:04.522 --> 00:52:06.223 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You said this is one
of your favorites, this is?

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:07.058 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: I love that

00:52:07.058 --> 00:52:08.159 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What is it?

00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:10.227 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: This is a kind of flower.

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:12.129 align:middle line:90%
It is called Albizzia.

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:13.431 align:middle line:90%
There are two kinds of albizzia.

00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:15.666 align:middle line:84%
There is another one that
is a flower, and I was going

00:52:15.666 --> 00:52:18.002 align:middle line:84%
to bring it today because
I have an albizzia tree,

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:20.438 align:middle line:84%
but I could not get
up high enough.

00:52:20.438 --> 00:52:21.973 align:middle line:84%
It was growing; the
flowers are up too high.

00:52:21.973 --> 00:52:23.908 align:middle line:84%
I thought of it last
minute this morning,

00:52:23.908 --> 00:52:25.643 align:middle line:84%
I am going to fall
there and break my neck

00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:26.944 align:middle line:90%
and not make it to the show.

00:52:26.944 --> 00:52:29.313 align:middle line:84%
There are two kinds of albizzia,
and this is one of them.

00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:30.614 align:middle line:90%
You can see what it smells like.

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:31.849 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Berry!

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:36.153 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is a very potent,
beautiful, sweet, aero,

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.621 align:middle line:84%
you could definitely
make a perfume out of it

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:40.458 align:middle line:90%
to get the subtleties out of it.

00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:44.996 align:middle line:84%
But when you take albizzia
flower, it calms your emotions.

00:52:44.996 --> 00:52:49.367 align:middle line:84%
It is called a major shen tonic,
shen being your spiritual power.

00:52:49.367 --> 00:52:54.005 align:middle line:84%
So, that particular kind of
albizzia comes from the jungles

00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:57.375 align:middle line:84%
of southern China, like in,
like Vietnam, places like that.

00:52:57.375 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It is very floral, beautiful,
it, people who tend to get angry

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.651 align:middle line:84%
and tense, you know, frustrated,
then this kind of albizzia just,

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:11.122 align:middle line:84%
you just, it does not make you
flat, it just makes you calm.

00:53:11.122 --> 00:53:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Have you been
to the fields?

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.825 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: For this, yeah
I have seen this.

00:53:14.825 --> 00:53:16.293 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: For the flowering.

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.796 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It is actually
a pink, white, like a,

00:53:18.796 --> 00:53:21.399 align:middle line:84%
close to magnolia
flower type of thing.

00:53:21.399 --> 00:53:23.067 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Probably very
fragrant field.

00:53:23.067 --> 00:53:24.301 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: Yeah.

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:26.203 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You have had such
amazing adventures, travels.

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.806 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: You have to
go to the field.

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:29.740 align:middle line:90%
You know, one thing-

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.142 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: To experience it

00:53:31.142 --> 00:53:32.543 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: But the truth is the most
important thing is to take them.

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:33.744 align:middle line:90%
The compliance.

00:53:33.744 --> 00:53:37.114 align:middle line:84%
If you take these herbs,
even if you mix them up,

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:40.017 align:middle line:84%
but try to take, you know,
a blend of the best things

00:53:40.017 --> 00:53:44.522 align:middle line:84%
in the world, by the way if I
may mention that dragon herbs,

00:53:44.522 --> 00:53:48.325 align:middle line:84%
we have many licensed
acupuncturists that are

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.094 align:middle line:90%
on our call center, and that is

00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:53.831 align:middle line:84%
like a missionary type
of fervor we have.

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:55.966 align:middle line:84%
It is a free service;
you can call

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:57.601 align:middle line:90%
and get advice and consultation.

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:00.604 align:middle line:84%
If you want to buy the herbs
from us you can or not.

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:04.408 align:middle line:84%
We are, you know, that is
what we do, we turn people

00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:06.777 align:middle line:84%
on to tonic herbs and
tell you how to use them

00:54:06.777 --> 00:54:08.212 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You share the
knowledge with people.

00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: That is our job in life.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.816 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Not only to these
beautiful emporiums,

00:54:11.816 --> 00:54:14.819 align:middle line:84%
but you also have...the picture
that we saw of the emporium,

00:54:14.819 --> 00:54:19.390 align:middle line:84%
the tonic bars, you can also go
and you can sample these things

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.992 align:middle line:84%
and drink them right
there, right?

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.628 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, you can
drink them right there.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:27.531 align:middle line:90%
We do have many many drinks,

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.468 align:middle line:84%
and we are expanding our
menu, actually right now.

00:54:30.468 --> 00:54:32.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a showing in
a year we will be done,

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:37.708 align:middle line:84%
but right now we are making
all kinds of new elixir based

00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:38.843 align:middle line:90%
on the things we have been able

00:54:38.843 --> 00:54:40.211 align:middle line:84%
to bring together the
last couple of years.

00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:42.046 align:middle line:84%
I think it is going to
be, it already is one

00:54:42.046 --> 00:54:44.248 align:middle line:84%
of the most advanced
tonic bars in the world,

00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:46.884 align:middle line:84%
we are in another
growth phase right now.

00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:48.619 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What is a tonic bar?

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:51.522 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you started it
you said you could not keep

00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:52.957 align:middle line:90%
people out.

00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:58.362 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Well, that is the
extracts of things like reishi,

00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:01.365 align:middle line:84%
or rhodiola, you
know, like gynostemma,

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:03.467 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of things.

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:05.102 align:middle line:84%
And we extract them
in our different ways,

00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:07.705 align:middle line:84%
and you can make drinks out
of them, you can consume them

00:55:07.705 --> 00:55:09.073 align:middle line:90%
in a very pleasant way.

00:55:09.073 --> 00:55:11.709 align:middle line:84%
You can take them as capsules
because that is convenient.

00:55:11.709 --> 00:55:14.178 align:middle line:84%
I wake up in the morning,
and I have a little spinner,

00:55:14.178 --> 00:55:16.714 align:middle line:84%
and I have my herbs in
there and I just take five

00:55:16.714 --> 00:55:18.315 align:middle line:84%
or six things then
maybe come back

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.617 align:middle line:84%
and take some more
in the afternoon.

00:55:19.617 --> 00:55:21.752 align:middle line:84%
It is part of my daily
routine, I love to walk

00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:25.923 align:middle line:84%
into my home elixir bar, it
is like walking into a temple.

00:55:25.923 --> 00:55:27.258 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh how fun.

00:55:27.258 --> 00:55:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: So we have made the
elixir bar sort of like that.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.096 align:middle line:84%
You can walk in and try
different things, you don't have

00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:34.932 align:middle line:84%
to buy the whole bottle
obviously, you can try a drink,

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:37.801 align:middle line:84%
and if you feel good from
it, or you read about it,

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.905 align:middle line:84%
it is just a way to, it
is more than sampling,

00:55:40.905 --> 00:55:42.606 align:middle line:84%
you can actually make
it a routine if you live

00:55:42.606 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles, or when
you come into the store

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.078 align:middle line:84%
to get your stuff, you
can try something new,

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and the herbalist- I have
built a body of two believers

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:54.685 align:middle line:84%
around me who understand
the herbs,

00:55:54.685 --> 00:55:57.721 align:middle line:84%
they are all amazingly
knowledgeable.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, they know
everything I know,

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.991 align:middle line:84%
I mean I would trust
my life with them.

00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:04.261 align:middle line:84%
There they are to tell
you about the herbs.

00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:05.896 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And they are
online as well for you,

00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:06.997 align:middle line:90%
or available by phone.

00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:09.166 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah, available
by phone and online,

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:10.634 align:middle line:90%
and we are just available.

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:12.136 align:middle line:84%
We have made ourselves
like that.

00:56:12.136 --> 00:56:13.537 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well, it is wonderful.

00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:16.974 align:middle line:84%
And so, just to, if someone were
to start off on a basic program,

00:56:16.974 --> 00:56:19.276 align:middle line:84%
you would recommend
of course the chaga.

00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:22.379 align:middle line:84%
Is that, is this red
by the way, the chaga?

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:25.516 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: That is not chaga,
that one is saffron.

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:26.884 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Saffron?

00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:29.787 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Saffron it comes, this
particular saffron it comes

00:56:29.787 --> 00:56:36.126 align:middle line:84%
from Tibet, and it is, they
use a little bit in a tea

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.429 align:middle line:90%
and it opens your heart.

00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:39.763 align:middle line:90%
It is a very spiritual herb.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:42.566 align:middle line:84%
You know, that much saffron,
you pay for that when you go

00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:44.568 align:middle line:84%
to the little markets,
right, in the little vial.

00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:45.703 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:56:45.703 --> 00:56:47.071 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: You just take a
little bit like this.

00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:48.472 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: A little pinch.

00:56:48.472 --> 00:56:49.974 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: Yeah a little pinch, you
mix it with the gynostemma tea

00:56:49.974 --> 00:56:53.244 align:middle line:84%
and it actually opens you
heart, it is like a holy herb

00:56:53.244 --> 00:56:55.212 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And if you put it
in with the red mushroom?

00:56:55.212 --> 00:56:57.114 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It would just
turn it even redder,

00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:58.916 align:middle line:84%
and that one improves
your circulation.

00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:00.884 align:middle line:90%
You asked a couple-

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Circulation
and increasing blood.

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: It yeah, now you see
you are becoming an herbalist.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.725 align:middle line:90%
That is what you do.

00:57:07.725 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I can see how
this would be fun

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.363 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: You have built the
blood, and that will help it

00:57:12.363 --> 00:57:15.065 align:middle line:84%
to circulate well, and
that is so healthy.

00:57:15.065 --> 00:57:17.301 align:middle line:84%
How healthy a thing
can you have?

00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:20.638 align:middle line:84%
Because our circulation is
fundamental to our well being.

00:57:20.638 --> 00:57:23.474 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It is so easy, it is so
easy, and it is so beautiful,

00:57:23.474 --> 00:57:26.176 align:middle line:84%
and thank you so much for
sharing what you have shared

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.946 align:middle line:84%
with us today, this
is all fascinating

00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:30.147 align:middle line:90%
and fun and beautiful.

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:32.683 align:middle line:84%
And all towards radiant
health and longevity.

00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:34.652 align:middle line:84%
Does not get any
better than that.

00:57:34.652 --> 00:57:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> RT: It was my pleasure.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.221 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Thank you so much

00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:39.957 align:middle line:84%
>> RT: And people contact
us, we are open to talk.

00:57:39.957 --> 00:57:41.425 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great, thank you.

00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:43.494 align:middle line:84%
