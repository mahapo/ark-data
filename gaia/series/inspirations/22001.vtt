00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of the greatest
challenges of our time

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:84%
can be understood by looking at
our past social patterns that

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
got us into where we
are as a society today.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So by looking at our history we
can better change our future.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today
is Riane Eisler.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:90%
She is a pioneer, a futurist.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
She is an expert in the
study of complex systems

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and making them very simple
for us to understand.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
She's been recognized as one
of the top 20 macrohistorians

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and has
written about new systems

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
for change in her iconic books,
"The Real Wealth of Nations"

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:90%
and "The Chalice and the Blade."

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me, Riane.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RIANE EISLER: It's a great
pleasure to be with you, Lisa.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is my honor
to have you here.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I am so looking forward
to speaking with you

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:90%
on a female to female level.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I have so many questions.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But first, I want
you to share with us

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
your past and how

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
you have come to
understand your past

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much how it propelled
you to creating as much

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:90%
change as you have.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about where you grew up.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, as
you know, in my work

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I introduce two new
classifications for society--

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
what I call a domination system
and a partnership system.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was born in
Europe, in Vienna,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
at a time of massive
regression to the domination

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
side of what's
really a continuum.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It's always a matter of degree.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It was the rise to
power of the Nazis,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
first in Germany, and
then my native Austria.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So that from day to the
next, my parents and I,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
we became hunted
with license to kill.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.485 align:middle line:90%
And I was a very small child.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How old
were you when you

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
started to realize
what was happening?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I
was six years old.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Six.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it was Crystal
Night, which was so-called

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
glass that was shattered

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in Jewish homes and
businesses and synagogues,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
when a gang of Gestapo
men broke into our home

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and dragged my father away.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.785 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that night, of
course, cruelty, violence.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I also saw
something else that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:90%
had a profound influence on me.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I today
call spiritual courage.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Today you call it that.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But back when you
were watching that,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how
impactful that would

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
have been to a
six-year-old child,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and where you've come
today, what you've

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
done by teaching so many people
about what you experienced

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
at that pivotal
moment in your life,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
about the domination
versus the partnership.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.979 align:middle line:90%
Explain a little bit about that.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, let
me first tell you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
who exemplified
spiritual courage for me.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It was my mother.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And she recognized
one of the Gestapo men

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.447 align:middle line:84%
as a young man who had worked
for the family business

00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:90%
as an errand boy.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:90%
And she got furious.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, how dare you
do this to this man who

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:90%
has been so kind to you.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.887 align:middle line:90%
I want him back.

00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, she could have been killed.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Many people were
killed that night.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:90%
But by a miracle, she wasn't.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And by a miracle, we escaped.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I call
it spiritual courage

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
because we think of
courage-- we talk

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's courage to slay
the dragon, kill the enemy.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But spiritual courage
is what she displayed

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to stand up against
injustice, out of love.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways that's
what my work is about.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it's really
to answer questions

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that arose very
early for me about

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:90%
does it have to be in this way?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
When we have such a capacity
for caring, for empathy,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
for love-- what I
saw in my mother--

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
why has there been
so much cruelty,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
violence, destructiveness?

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It existed way
before that time period,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and it has existed since then.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That's right.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So I eventually-- eventually
it was these questions about,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
does it have to be this way
or is there an alternative,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that led to my search
for an alternative.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't find it by using
the conventional categories--

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
right, left,
religious, secular--

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.752 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Education.

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well,
Eastern or Western,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
for that matter--
all the categories

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're so used to.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Because none of them describe,
really-- none of them

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
answer that question.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You can have terrible
regimes on either side.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that my first book
"The Chalice and the Blade"

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
really drew from this
multidisciplinary,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:90%
cross-cultural research.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you know, I
wrote many other books--

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many, yes.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --applying the
partnership and domination

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
lenses to various areas,
including, as you just said,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, which is
a great place to start.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.555 align:middle line:84%
And there was an entire DVD
that you did, which is great.

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:04.054 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see clips of that

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
today, from
"Tomorrow's Children."

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And it really exemplifies the
explanation between partnership

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.484 align:middle line:90%
and, well, domination.

00:05:12.484 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take at
that clip really quick,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
so we could see it in the DVD.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: This distinction
between the partnership

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and dominator models
comes out of my research

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
over three decades,
multi-disciplinary research

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at a large span of
our cultural evolution that

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is reported, in part, in my book
"The Chalice and the Blade."

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
This research addresses
fundamental questions

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that many of us have asked,
questions that in my life

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
came out of my experiences
as a little girl

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Austria,
questions such as do we

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
have to hunt and
persecute each other?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
When we humans have such an
enormous capacity for caring,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
for creativity, what is it
that has tilted us back?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.585 align:middle line:84%
Don't we have any
alternatives to this way

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that is so often presented to
us as just the way things are?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Out of this research
the answer came, yes.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:90%
We do have alternatives.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot see these
alternatives unless we look

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
at human history
through a wider lens.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
What we begin to see is that
societies-- whether they're

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
ancient or modern, Eastern
or Western-- that orient more

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
to the dominator model, we
see that the primary principle

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
for organizing relations is
ranking-- man over woman,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
man over man, race over
race, nation over nation,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
man over nature.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But as you move more towards
the partnership model,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see a different
governing principle: linking.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:90%
There are still hierarchies.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
There are still very clear
lines of responsibility

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and leadership, but leadership
is not based on the power

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to dominate, to control
through fear, through force.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It is not disempowering,
but empowering.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and leadership
can be empowering.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But right now in our
education system,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
it appears that it
is very challenged.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard this
for a while now.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
that this is being

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
used, the domination
versus partnership model,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:90%
in education?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the
so-called No Child

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Left Behind has really been
a symptom of regression,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:90%
again, to the domination side.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Because what does it really do?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It ranks us again, doesn't it?

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The testing, yes.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yeah,
and it humiliates.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It humiliates teachers and
schools that don't perform.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth of the
matter is that children

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
learn when they're engaged.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Children learn when
they're cared for.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Children learn when there
is that sense that there is

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
somebody that they're
with-- a teacher, a parent--

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A partner.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --who
really respects them,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:84%
who treats them as a
partner, not as just somebody

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to tell regurgitate, repeat to
me, what I've just taught you.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm afraid that
a lot of this,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
under the guise of reform,
has actually been regression.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The opposite.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know what
needs to be done.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And my book,
"Tomorrow's Children,"

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:54.049 align:middle line:84%
includes really proven
methods that we know work.

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and they're
very good methods.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was in school,
I went through that,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
where I just had
to regurgitate it.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And we took the tests.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And we were scored on the tests.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was nothing that I
could relate to at a young age.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
School for me was
not as easy as I

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.669 align:middle line:90%
thought it was for other people.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the other
people were experiencing

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
the same thing I was.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.144 align:middle line:84%
Now I look at my
daughter, who's nine,

00:09:17.144 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
going through school
these days, and she

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:84%
has teachers who
act as partners.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But they still then have
to take the testing.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of a
double message there.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, it's made
it very hard for teachers.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Most teachers, if you
talk to them, they'll say,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:90%
this is a diversion.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we need to have some
standards, some evaluation.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.064 align:middle line:84%
But the evaluation
shouldn't be like grading

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
on the curve, where somebody
has to be on the bottom

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and somebody's on top.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:90%
That's pure domination teaching.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It should be what kind of
progress is this child making?

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
How is this child talented?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it isn't so much in this
area, but maybe it's in art.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.952 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's-- in other words,
educata means to elicit,

00:10:05.952 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
rather than to cram down.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.227 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere that
we go, though, we

00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
experience this domination
model-- in our government,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in our systems, wherever we go--
when you get in an airplane.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It's all top down philosophies,
everywhere you go.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well and yet,
we have moved, very much,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
from much more rigid
domination times to today.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a very uneasy
mix of partnership elements

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:90%
and domination elements.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
modern history, which

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I've done through my
work, you actually

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
see something very interesting.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You see that every single
progressive modern movement

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.887 align:middle line:84%
has challenged a
tradition of domination.

00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, this is true.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.136 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Whether it was
the so-called rights of man

00:10:55.136 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
movement, or the women's
movement, or the abolitionists

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and civil rights
movement-- these supposedly

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.456 align:middle line:90%
divinely ordained rankings.

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even the
Occupy movement.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well, absolutely.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Or the environmental movement,
challenging the once hallowed

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:90%
conquest of nature.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really
talking about here

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
is understanding
what needs to change.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
work has been about.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in the video
that you just showed,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at areas-- we
have to think outside the box.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, when we're
talking about society,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk about how
women fair in society, even

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.102 align:middle line:84%
though we're half
of the population.

00:11:36.102 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More than half.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: More than half.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about how that
affects our system of values.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about how
children are treated,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it is partnership
care giving or dominator

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:90%
care giving.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot about
respect, but in domination

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:90%
systems, it's fear, isn't it?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.821 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Respect
has to go both ways.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember
there was a quote

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that I read that if
women ruled the world,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
they would never send
their sons to war.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because no mama wants
to see her baby killed.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And yet, women have
been socialized, just like men,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:90%
to fit into domination systems.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:84%
In Iran, for example,
women actually

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
were asked to send their
children into the minefields

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
ahead of the army during
the war with Iraq.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they were told
that their children would

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:84%
immediately ascend
to heaven as martyrs.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really
consider that this is not

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
a question of anything
inherent in women or men.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It is really a question of what
kind of a system do we build.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot
of evidence showing

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that partnership systems
have existed, do exist,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:90%
and that they work better.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
they thrive, yes.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That they thrive.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But we have to bring
that information out.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Because it isn't.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.795 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, no
that's very true.

00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Especially-- I'm going to go
back to the education system

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.586 align:middle line:84%
here for a minute,
because there's

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
another clip I wanted to show
about what Riane was talking

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
about earlier, about
our education system

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and how it is a conveyor
belt system of running kids

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
through the mill of
an education system.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: If you
look at the picture

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that we get about schools
from the popular culture,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.165 align:middle line:84%
from television, where young
people, students, are moved

00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
on a conveyor belt from class
to class, from grade to grade,

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
really like a factory, a place
where education is something

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that is done to students,
rather than with students.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.735 align:middle line:84%
We all know that,
for real learning,

00:13:49.735 --> 00:13:54.271 align:middle line:84%
young people need to
be actively engaged.

00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, actively engaged
is very, very important.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Actively engaged.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.863 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does
this type of thing

00:13:58.863 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:90%
address violence in schools?

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, in
domination systems,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:84%
where you have this ranking,
people grow up with this notion

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that there are only
two alternatives:

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
you either dominant
or you're dominated.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So war, the war of the sexes--
they're built into the system.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And violence is, of
course, the ultimate way

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that domination systems
maintain themselves,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the
family, whether it's

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in gender relations,
whether it's

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.117 align:middle line:84%
in national or
international relations.

00:14:29.117 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So you can't
just tack on nonviolence

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to a fundamentally
imbalanced system.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
that we really

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:90%
need really fundamental change.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And the movement today
against bullying,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
for example-- that's a sign of
movement towards partnership.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Because it used to be accepted.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, there's a lot of
awareness being raised now.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yes,
which is wonderful.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just saw a
DVD on-- it was released

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was shot by a
child, a nine-year-old.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.442 align:middle line:84%
And he showed, from
his experience,

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
of what it felt
like to be bullied.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And it went viral.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.276 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting-- so that
is how it's starting to work,

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
where the partnership
model is starting

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:90%
to become a lot more supported.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.552 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot to
do with awareness.

00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, there's
always awareness,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
because from awareness
then flows action.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And the more changes we
make-- not only in ourselves,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, but in the cultural
structures, in the values,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
in the relationships,
which are all

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
interconnected-- the more then
our awareness that something

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:90%
better is possible also comes.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interactive process.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
"The Power of Partnership"

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
basically on that subject.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And it really is very useful.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I use it in-- I
teach leadership,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:90%
transformative leadership.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank God.

00:15:55.195 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:90%
You teach leadership, yes.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And that's one
of the texts that we use.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
very down to earth.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And it really deals with how we
relate to everything, including

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We do actually
have another clip here

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.205 align:middle line:84%
of the violence in schools
and violence in education.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.269 align:middle line:84%
And it explains
the system of what

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Riane is talking about in this.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.987 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:16:18.987 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: If we
really think about it,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
every curriculum is woven
around a particular conceptual

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
framework, around basic
assumptions, assumptions

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that are then communicated
through the curriculum,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
assumptions about what is valued
or not valued in a society.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, we already
have quite a few partnership

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
elements in the curriculum.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, we
also have many elements

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have inherited
from earlier times that

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
orient it more to
the dominator model.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, we tell
kids don't be violent.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But what are the dates that
we ask them to memorize?

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:90%
The dates of wars.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So aren't we really
teaching young people

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to get into a
history book, go kill somebody?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Aren't we really
perpetuating the values

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want
to perpetuate?

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
this is so imbalanced,

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:84%
because so little
attention in the curriculum

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:27.579 align:middle line:84%
is given to nonviolently
achieved gains,

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the social reforms
to which we owe just

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
about all the good
things in our lives.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If we don't want young people
to be alienated and apathetic,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
we need to show them that
nonviolent change is possible

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.075 align:middle line:84%
and that they can
make it happen.

00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
take a situation that

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is as vast as bullying in
schools and really change it?

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you make that real
social change happen?

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, it
isn't just one thing

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
ever that makes for a change.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
There's some excellent
programs, by the way,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:90%
now that schools are using.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
My-- I have a number of
wonderful grandchildren,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and my 11-year-old grandchild--
he's a wonderful boy.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the people who is
in one of those in his school.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.969 align:middle line:90%
They have that program.

00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's a public school.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, public
schools are not failing.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:84%
There are just some public
schools that are failing.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
that the charter

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
schools, on the surface, look
like they're doing better.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.649 align:middle line:84%
But that's because they
select whom to admit.

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, that's true.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And so let's
not go in that direction.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: OK, but let
me get back to this--

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.372 align:middle line:84%
so the kids are learning that
bullying isn't acceptable.

00:18:46.372 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I
agree with you-- I'm

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
sorry to interrupt--
about the public schools,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:84%
is that it has actually caused
more emphasis on the parents

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
helping and participating
in their child's education,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
because the government
support has been

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
so diminished, that
the parents really

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
have taken a larger
role in education.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They're assisting
in the classroom.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
They're creating
parent-run organizations

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that support the kids, with
the music programs and art.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
It's really, actually,
been a nice backlash.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the problem
is that this is all right.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.932 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful in the
sense for middle class

00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and upper middle class
families, but, you

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
know, lower middle
class families,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:84%
poor families-- they're
working two jobs.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They don't have
the time, the energy,

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
or the knowledge.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of
them have learned

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
parenting as you tell
your kid what to do

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and you slap the kid.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what are we
teaching a child if we do that?

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching a child
that it's OK for somebody

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
to impose their will
through violence.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the lesson.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.881 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Domination again.

00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Domination, again.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think that what we
really have to look at

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is not so much what the
individual parent does,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
but what are the circumstances,
the social conditions.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where
we come to an area

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that I'm working on
very, very much now,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
which is social policy, and
especially economic policy.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you really get
into these individual systems,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
where it's economics-- or
I mean, if it's education,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
or if it is economics,
or if it is social,

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
it's all interconnected,
as you're explaining here.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:90%
It's all interconnected.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yeah, we're
taught such a fragmented

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
way of looking at things,
like religious or secular.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:90%
What kind of religion?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:90%
What kind of secularism?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it partnership or is
it domination oriented?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Or Eastern or Western?

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
A colleague of mine calls
these old categories weapons

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:90%
of mass distraction.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Distraction, yes.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Because
they really are.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.806 align:middle line:90%
They fragment our consciousness.

00:20:53.806 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
our consciousness

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:90%
is constantly fragmented.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.206 align:middle line:84%
And this approach is really
about connecting the dots.

00:21:00.206 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see,
that's what you've

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.704 align:middle line:90%
done with all of your work.

00:21:02.704 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yes, that is
what my work is about.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I could see that.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Between "The Real Wealth
of Nations" and then

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
"The Chalice and the
Blade" started it.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And "Real Wealth of Nations"
address the economy.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes into the
school system and the education,

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
with "Tomorrow's Children,"
and the partnership model.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I completely see how it
is all interconnected.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:90%
You're smiling because I-- yes.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I'm
smiling because I realized,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:84%
down the road
someplace-- when I wrote

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
"The Chalice and the
Blade," it was about power.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the chalice
and the blade

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
symbolize two very
different kinds of power.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with power.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But is it going to be
the blade, the power

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:90%
to dominate, to destroy?

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, I'm so
glad you said that.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's a very
good distinction.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Or is it the power
of the chalice, the power

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to give life, not to take it,
to nurture, to illuminate life.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the next book
I wrote was about sex--

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.854 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That came in there?

00:21:54.854 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it came in, right.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.936 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: "Sacred Pleasure."

00:21:56.936 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, the last one
is economics, which is money,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
so it's really a trilogy
on power, sex, and money.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:90%
But it was funny.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I realized it after I wrote
"The Real Wealth of Nations."

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
those are really

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:84%
the most important
levers, aren't they?

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
absolutely true.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Because sex has
been used, as you--

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I took this from your
book, "Sacred Pleasure"--

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
has been used to form humanity
in societies for decades,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:90%
centuries.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the whole
idea that sex is bad

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and that woman is a
temptress to man--

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely-- look, if man
can't trust half of humanity--

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:90%
everybody has a mother.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't even trust
that half of humanity,

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
you can't trust anybody.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And mistrust is
part of also what

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
keeps domination systems going.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's very good reason
to mistrust in those systems.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.864 align:middle line:90%
It isn't our imagination.

00:22:56.864 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:90%
We've seen evidence.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yeah,
it's the evidence.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, and education.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Always education, whether
it's formal education

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
or informal education
through the media.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got to pay a lot
of attention to that.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote
"Tomorrow's Children."

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.818 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're
going to touch on that,

00:23:14.818 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very important.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.797 align:middle line:84%
Media, as you said, is
a form of education.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yes.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.046 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:23:20.046 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It shapes and forms the
way that we-- our behaviors

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
as a society,
societal behaviors.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But so are
fairy tales education.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:90%
So is religion education.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
What does a girl take away
from stories like Cinderella--

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Princess--

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.281 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --or Sleeping Beauty.

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --rescuer.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That's right.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.255 align:middle line:90%
She's helpless.

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She's a victim.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: She can't do anything.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.765 align:middle line:90%
But also--

00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She has to be saved.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: She has to be saved.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But not only that-- we are
still idealizing rankings.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.777 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's a king, a prince.

00:23:48.777 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Those are the good people.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: It's so subtle.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.304 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
about it that way.

00:23:53.304 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: It's so subtle.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's fascinating.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:84%
The work that I do is really
like a Sherlock Holmes

00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of--

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.964 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're a detective.

00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yes, a detective.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of things
that don't seem to make

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
sense suddenly
start making sense.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That everything is
based on this domination

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.806 align:middle line:84%
versus partnership model,
everywhere you look.

00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And we've inherited.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
have to remember.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
European Middle Ages,

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.425 align:middle line:84%
they looked like the
Taliban, didn't they--

00:24:22.425 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
the Inquisition, the Crusades,
the holy war, the jihad.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Women were nothing--
witch burnings,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.284 align:middle line:84%
whether you slowly stone a woman
to death or burn her to death.

00:24:37.284 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're not leaders.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.574 align:middle line:90%
They were not leaders, yes.

00:24:39.574 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: We have moved forward.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We have moved to the
partnership side,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
but always against
enormous resistance

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and periodic regression.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a spiral
upward movement with dips.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And we're in a dip now.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we would
be out of it already.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't been.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's up to us.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:90%
It's really up to us.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In a
microcosm way, though,

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:84%
don't we go from
the dips to the--

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
don't we constantly
spiral as a society?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Don't we go from the
hills to the valleys?

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't we always do that?

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: To some extent.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that we
need to continue to do this.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's part
of Hindu philosophy,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:90%
that there are these cycles.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't see history that way.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we started--
the original direction

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, as I document
in "The Chalice and the Blade,"

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
was more in a
partnership direction.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And then came the shift.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.349 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're trying
to shift again--

00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well the shift was maybe
a bit of a backlash, though.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: to the
partnership side.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that the
shift was a bit of a backlash?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well the
shift, I think--

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:90%
there are many theories.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But I subscribe to the
climate change and invasions

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
theory, that in the more
fertile areas of the globe,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
where if you will, the Earth
was a good mother, the more

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
partnership-- never perfect,
never perfect, never ideal--

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but less violent, more
egalitarian direction.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In the more fringe and
inhospitable areas,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
you got more of the
domination system.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And during a period of
enormous climate change, which

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
has been aridification,
desertification-- you know,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the Sahara was
once very fertile.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.664 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:26:19.664 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I did not.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Oh, we're not taught
the most interesting things

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:90%
about our history.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But during this period, these
hoards began to encroach.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was this shift, even
in the more civilized areas.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So now of course-- and
also recorded history.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
There has been, what you
said, this tension constantly

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
between these two-- in terms of
the language of chaos theory,

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
of nonlinear
dynamics-- attractors,

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
really, the partnership system
and the domination system.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But in modern
history, as I said,

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
all the progressive
modern movements

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
have challenged
traditions of domination.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So we have been
movement to the partnership

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:90%
side with regressions.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I sometimes
joke about it,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, when I get depressed,
I think of the European Middle

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Ages.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.547 align:middle line:90%
Because we have moved forward.

00:27:09.547 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we have.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: We would be killed
for this conversation just a few

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:90%
hundred years ago.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are
absolutely right.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: For even thinking
it, much less saying it.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: On a public forum--
absolutely, you are right.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:90%
That is a great perspective.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, so what we need are
more models of how to be,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:90%
more models of partnership.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
We've definitely got the
model of the dominance.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:90%
So we see that.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And we see how we want
to move away from that.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we need
to see is models

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of how to move towards
it, to visually

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
see that working in our
communities, in our schools,

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
in our societies, in our
economy-- absolutely.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.682 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to see.

00:27:46.682 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
a clip here, which

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
is a really good one,
about-- I love this.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
This is back to the
education system,

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
on how children teach
what they learn,

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:90%
right there in the classroom.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.262 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:27:59.262 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVE KETTER: I make it
a point, as a teacher,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
to never do for
students what I think

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:90%
they can do for themselves.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
It's quite important for us,
as teachers, to get students

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
talking to each other,
and not just the teacher

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.330 align:middle line:84%
talking to the group or the
group talking to the teacher

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
and answering questions.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.606 align:middle line:84%
And pair teaching is a
major aspect of that.

00:28:16.606 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH BREWER: So in
the systems class,

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
specifically, we have
had this thing where

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.590 align:middle line:84%
a student or a group of
students will take home

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a packet or a
chapter or something

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that they've
researched on their own

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back into the
class and present it and be

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:84%
the teacher of that class
for 10 minutes or a day.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
At some point we'll get to that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
helpful because you're

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
getting a different
viewpoint than you would--

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you're not having
the same person

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:90%
or two people present every day.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So hearing things from
a different voice,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
from a different person,
with their influence in it,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:90%
it is really helpful.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MURIEL MONTGOMERY: I think
you'd learn more this way

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
because, instead of being
subjected to one point of view,

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
like the teacher talking
and you listening,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.915 align:middle line:84%
it's the teacher
bouncing off ideas

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:04.865 align:middle line:84%
and the students bouncing off
ideas off of other students.

00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of hearing
one view, you get, like, 10.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Just socially, you get
interaction with other people

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and, like, learn how to
politely receive ideas.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.892 align:middle line:84%
If I see somebody who's not
talking, maybe open their mouth

00:29:17.892 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and act like they're
about to talk,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't say anything if
I've been saying things.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I see that a lot, just
courtesy in conversation.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
People encourage other kids
who haven't spoken to speak.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.202 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
neat because in more

00:29:34.202 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
traditional classrooms
that I've been in,

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:90%
that's not the case at all.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
example of a model

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that-- where does that
school exist, by the way.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:90%
I looked it up.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't--

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.713 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: The Nova School.

00:29:44.713 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:90%
It was a so-called alternative.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And see, this is the problem.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
All these models exist,
but they're marginalized.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And our job
is to really bring them

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.675 align:middle line:90%
into the mainstream.

00:29:54.675 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I saw that
that was in Florida,

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:90%
but I'd love to bring--

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.835 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: No, no, no.

00:29:57.835 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
That school, actually--
there were a number

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
of schools in that DVD
of "Tomorrow's Children."

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.700 align:middle line:90%
The high school is in Seattle.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:09.487 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yeah.

00:30:09.487 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I was wondering.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing,
amazing school.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Oh, it's
a wonderful school.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
But see, the models exist.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And they work.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The curriculum exists
and it's even in your books.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And the point of
it is-- is to, as I said,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.620 align:middle line:90%
make this information known.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.297 align:middle line:90%
Change the conversation.

00:30:30.297 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The curriculum
actually exists

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:84%
with your organization,
doesn't it?

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: We have a great
many resources at the Center

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
for Partnership Studies website,
which is partnershipway.org,

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
on all kinds of things,
and certainly on education.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to
invite our viewers

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to avail themselves
of them and--

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and how
to raise young leaders

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and young learners.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And yes, and how to really
change the education model.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:90%
It's being done.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you have--
your organization

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%
has put together a wonderful
curriculum and resources

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and so forth for it to be
able to be carried forth

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to many different
school systems.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.422 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
glad that you did that.

00:31:13.422 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
That is, in my view, putting
this conversation into action.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's making real change.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It's giving people practical
tools to make this to happen.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we as parents want
to see our children having

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:84%
those options, getting
away from-- this

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is the generation,
and the ones to come,

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that change these
types of systems,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that move from the domination
to the partnership.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you do it, is by
putting those practical tools

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:90%
into people's hands.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Yes.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
leadership organization

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that you have as well-- I mean,
the curriculum that you have

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.860 align:middle line:84%
as well-- tell me a
little bit about that.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we have a
program for leadership training

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to really change
economic structures,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:84%
economic policies,
economic practices.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an online program.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
leave your home,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
don't have to leave
your chair, to take it.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's nine weeks, one
and a half hours a week.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fabulous program.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And I invite people to check
it out at partnershipway.org.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.112 align:middle line:84%
And you can find it when
you see those circles.

00:32:22.112 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The circle of chairs.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and we're
going to be covering

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:90%
that a little bit later.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
important to-- again,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
to be able to put
these tools and to make

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.090 align:middle line:90%
them practical for people.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: We also have a
wonderful caring and connected

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
parenting guide for the first
four years-- zero to four--

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh really?

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.614 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --based on
the latest neuroscience.

00:32:41.614 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So you're quite right, Lisa.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous amount
of practical information

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:90%
that can be used and adapted.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes,
absolutely, right away.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- just
curious-- the zero to four.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It really starts
there, doesn't it?

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It not
only starts there,

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.030 align:middle line:84%
we know now from
neuroscience that those

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:02.800 align:middle line:90%
are the most important years.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so shocking
that ours is the only developed

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
nation that does not offer
paid parental leave--

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:84%
government supported--
that does not

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:84%
offer high quality early
childhood education.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
really pay very dearly

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:90%
if we don't change that course.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot compete in
the post-industrial era without

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:84%
investing in the capacity
development of our children.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.541 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, it
starts from zero to four.

00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are you
saying that there

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:84%
needs to be an education
in place from zero to four?

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I think that what
we need are policies that--

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Support parents.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Certainly, we
need parenting education.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Because what used to be
sound parenting education--

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's still being peddled--
is dominator education.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Terrorizing a child
to accept that the parent's

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
will is law is perfect
for domination systems.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.932 align:middle line:84%
It's terrible for a
democracy, isn't it?

00:34:05.932 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's very true.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.174 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:34:08.174 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, you still need
to be able to give children

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.800 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, because that's
the most important--

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
not without that.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.378 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I speak
of the difference

00:34:14.378 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:84%
between authoritative and
authoritarian-- big difference.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:84%
And we need teachers,
we need parents,

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:90%
we need loci of authority.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But the question,
again-- we're back

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:90%
to "The Chalice and the Blade."

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Is the power going to be
disempowering or empowering?

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that in
the corporate literature

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:40.600 align:middle line:84%
we now read about
empowering employees--

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:84%
is very much, again,
another partnership trend.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes and that's--

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: More rhetoric than
reality sometimes, but at least

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.185 align:middle line:90%
we're changing the perception.

00:34:50.185 --> 00:34:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the
smaller companies,

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
it's definitely reality.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But yes, in the larger companies
it tends to just be on paper.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's very
interesting, though,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:84%
about the authoritarian
versus authority.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very, very
clear distinction there,

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
children boundaries.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They must
have boundaries.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.351 align:middle line:84%
Children-- they're
learning about--

00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where they
fit in the world.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.391 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Where they fit in the
world, about what's dangerous

00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and what's good, what's bad.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:84%
That whole relativism that's so
fashionable in so many new age

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:84%
circles about
don't be judgmental

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is a straight line back into the
domination-- terrible, punitive

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
morality.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:90%
People need standards.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we say everything
goes, everything

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:84%
is relative-- there's
a big difference

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:84%
between understanding
why somebody bought

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle line:84%
into-- like the women
in Iran I spoke about.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
We can understand why they were
socialized to believe this,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
that we agree with it.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.534 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean by judgmental?

00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: By
judgemental I mean we

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
have to make a judgment
as to whether something

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:90%
is right or wrong.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And I think it's wrong
to send your children ahead

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of an army to explode the
mines, right, and to die.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you think the free
parenting thinking, where

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
parents raise their children
with more free philosophies,

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily healthy?

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Not necessarily, no.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, what
happens so often is

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
you get rebellion rather
than reconstruction.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
My work is about
deconstruction, certainly,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:84%
about understanding what
the problem really is.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's not about
rebelling against it,

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.732 align:middle line:84%
which is what the
free parenting was.

00:36:29.732 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The parents do.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's about
reconstructing.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Caring
and Connected Parenting

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Guide is about.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It is not about the child
becoming the dominator.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's very true.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I-- yes, I can see how that
would make a big difference.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We've done both sides
of that parenting model.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I see the one
with the boundaries

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:90%
works so much better.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, because we
are really relearning so much.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- but we
have to unlearn and learn

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:90%
something new.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.446 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Such a beautiful
way of saying that.

00:37:02.446 --> 00:37:04.545 align:middle line:84%
You have a beautiful way
of say things, Riane.

00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:05.920 align:middle line:84%
All right, what
we're going to do

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
take a quick break.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're going
to talk more about the social

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and the economical
perspectives of all this,

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and how it goes into
a caring economy,

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.187 align:middle line:84%
and how those two words
actually work together.

00:37:17.187 --> 00:37:18.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.530 align:middle line:84%
My guest is social
scientist Riane Eisler.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're speaking
about so many things,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
with the domination
versus partnership model

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and how that occurs
everywhere in our society,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.956 align:middle line:90%
between education and media.

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And right now
we're going to talk

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
about how it appears
in our economics.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned something in your
work called caring economics.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.644 align:middle line:90%
What is a caring economics?

00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Don't we
do a double take just

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:84%
hearing caring and economics
in the same sentence?

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's an
oxymoron, kind of.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: But should it be?

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.585 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a terrible
comment, Lisa--

00:37:58.585 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know, true.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: No, think
about it-- on how

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught that
uncaring values should

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:90%
drive our economic systems.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Economic systems are
supposed-- supposed to--

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Support us.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That's right.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: So--

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have gone
so far away from that.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, and
there's a reason for that.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with what
we've been talking about,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
which is domination
or partnership.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because economics don't
arise in a vacuum.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.130 align:middle line:90%
They arise in a context.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And we still have so
many domination elements.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
domination system,

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
if you remember from
that clip, is the ranking

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.287 align:middle line:84%
of the male half of humanity
over the female half.

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Historically, yes.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Historically.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And with this comes a very
gendered system of values,

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.780 align:middle line:84%
where anything that's
stereotypically associated

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:84%
with women or the feminine--
caring, care giving,

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:84%
nonviolence-- is
devalued, whether it's

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:90%
in a woman or a man.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.930 align:middle line:84%
If a man-- he's a sissy
in the old system, right?

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:90%
He's a wimp.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:90%
He's effeminate.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Why should effeminate
be an insult?

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.160 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's also devalued in our
economic and business policy.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Once we become aware
of this, again,

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that don't seem
to make any sense-- after all,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:84%
why shouldn't we
really support caring

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:84%
for people and for
nature-- come into play.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because we've
been socialized

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:90%
that that's women's work.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the old domination
system, being a man

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.046 align:middle line:84%
is not being like
a woman, right?

00:39:51.046 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.961 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting
way of looking at it.

00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yeah, so now that
the gender stereotypes--

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
stereotypes, by the way.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we can see fathers who
are fathering the way that

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:84%
used to be unfit for real
men-- diapering a baby,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:06.924 align:middle line:90%
feeding a baby.

00:40:06.924 --> 00:40:07.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it's only as the
status of women rose that men--

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have risen
to the occasion more.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That's right.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.524 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
feel that it's

00:40:15.524 --> 00:40:18.940 align:middle line:84%
such a devaluation of
them, of their status,

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
to embrace something more
stereotypically feminine.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So gender is a
big, ignored piece

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:90%
that we had better look at.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I always make
the point which

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is, people are uncomfortable
talking about gender.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But then, let's remember what
the great sociologist Louis

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Wirth said.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.240 align:middle line:84%
He said the most important
things about a society

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:84%
are those that people
don't want to talk about.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:90%
We saw it with race, didn't we?

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, right.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And we're
seeing it with gender.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now it's gender, yes.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.771 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Only when
we talk about it,

00:40:48.771 --> 00:40:51.040 align:middle line:84%
when we put it out
in the open, can

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.000 align:middle line:84%
we actually understand how
the dots are connected.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My aunt was in a
great movie called "Mr. Mom"

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.040 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
20 years ago where

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that type of-- Michael
Keaton and Teri Garr.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They were in it in the--
it was all about that,

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.890 align:middle line:84%
it was all about how the
male was taking over.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was an important
movie at the time.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.378 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
wasn't being done then.

00:41:12.378 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It's being done
so much more now.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about caring economics

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.416 align:middle line:84%
and how those two
relate together.

00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a
look at some slides here.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Making the economic case for
caring-- what exactly is that?

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well--

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How children and
business and citizens

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
all need to work together,
or become one, and return

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:90%
on that investment.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, it's a
huge return on investment.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we've got to show.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have, at the
Center for Partnership Studies,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:84%
launched the caring
economy campaign.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're soon going to
have-- the campaign will soon

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.771 align:middle line:84%
have its own website,
caringeconomy.com.

00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And it will have a coalition of
major national organizations--

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.380 align:middle line:84%
women's organizations certainly,
children's organizations,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
think tanks, faith
organizations.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
to work together.

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But we also have this training
program that I told you about.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, which is--
now, when people create

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.030 align:middle line:84%
these types of policies,
when they create policies

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:84%
where they're caring
for each other,

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
it changes the system
of our economics

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.430 align:middle line:84%
because there are certain
organizations who have taken

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
on some of these caring
economics models.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
You give, for example,
some organizations

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that supply child care-- back
up child care programs-- that

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.340 align:middle line:90%
actually are more successful.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:90%
They have--

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, this is--
I bring out again, again,

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:90%
in "The Real Wealth of Nations."

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's information
that is up to us.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
the conversation.

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Because people will tell you,
well, caring, that soft, fuzzy,

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
feminine stuff--
it's not effective.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that it
is enormously effective.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have study after
study now showing that.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, the companies that
regularly appear in the Fortune

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.710 align:middle line:84%
500 or the Working Mothers
as the best companies to work

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.800 align:middle line:84%
for, they have more caring
policies-- child care,

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.650 align:middle line:84%
good health care,
paid parental leave.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.810 align:middle line:84%
They have a higher, a
significantly higher,

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.090 align:middle line:90%
return to investors.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.160 align:middle line:84%
When people feel that they and
their families are cared for,

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.610 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
work very hard so

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.144 align:middle line:90%
that that company is successful.

00:43:30.144 --> 00:43:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They feel
supported, so therefore they

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:90%
support the company.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.865 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

00:43:33.865 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And it happens not only
on the business level,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:90%
but on the national level.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're going
to be talking about that.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So well, let's actually
talk about that now.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.670 align:middle line:84%
On the national level,
how would that affect us?

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.786 align:middle line:84%
We see that in corporations
like we just saw, but how would

00:43:49.786 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:84%
it affect us at
a national level?

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.315 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, we have
models for that, too.

00:43:53.315 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's all there,
if we just really look

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the lenses of the
partnership versus domination,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.834 align:middle line:84%
of a caring or uncaring
economy, that go with each.

00:44:06.834 --> 00:44:08.250 align:middle line:84%
As I said, there's
been a movement

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.940 align:middle line:84%
towards the
partnership side, or we

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.690 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have, for
example, child labor laws.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Or we wouldn't have
any of the things

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that we have--
safety regulations.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in pure domination
systems, well, you had slavery.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks, for
example, with all

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of their-- the
Athenians, with all

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.910 align:middle line:84%
of their talk about democracy,
they were a slave society.

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
There were no protections there.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But as we have
moved, some nations

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:90%
have been in the forefront.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And these have been
nations like Sweden,

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.610 align:middle line:84%
like Finland, like Norway, like
Iceland-- which, by the way,

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.290 align:middle line:90%
have recovered.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Except-- Iceland
the bankers did in,

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:84%
but they have
recovered, all of them,

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.240 align:middle line:84%
from the recession,
the great recession,

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.270 align:middle line:84%
much better than
the United States.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons is that they

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:90%
have invested in their people.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, these nations--
think about it.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of
the 20th century,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:84%
they were so poor that
there were famines.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Whole states got populated--

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --Minnesota.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Today they are invariably
in the highest ranks,

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.750 align:middle line:84%
not only of the human
development reports

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.910 align:middle line:84%
of the United Nations, but
of the World Economic Forum's

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.700 align:middle line:90%
global competitiveness reports.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the main reasons
is that, as I said,

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:90%
they moved to a caring economy.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They have a mix of socialism,
yes, of central planning,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and a very healthy
market economy.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But they often call
themselves caring societies.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They have very generous
paid parental leave.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They have-- for both mothers
and fathers, by the way.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a clip that
we have that the Center

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
for Partnership Studies
put together of a study

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that they specifically
did around this.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.632 align:middle line:84%
And it's Men and Women and
the Global Equality of Life.

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: We did that
study at the Center

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.610 align:middle line:90%
for Partnership Studies.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's Women, Men, and the
Global Quality of Life.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And it documents
something that it's really

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:84%
our job to make
people understand.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start by giving
you some empirical evidence

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start with
some statistical studies.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We, at the Center for
Partnership Studies, which

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is the organization, the not for
profit, that I'm president of,

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:32.865 align:middle line:84%
did a study comparing
two bundles of measures

00:46:32.865 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:90%
from 89 nations in our world.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
One bundle looked
at quality of life.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.260 align:middle line:84%
The other bundle looked
at the status of women.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So we were looking at
matters in quality of life

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way from
infant mortality,

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to the gap between income
on top and on bottom,

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to human rights ratings,
environmental ratings.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And we found, in
this study, which

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is called Women, Men, and
the Global Quality of Life,

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.660 align:middle line:84%
that the status of women
can, in significant respects,

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.670 align:middle line:84%
be a better predictor of
the general quality of life

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of a society than GDP.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.655 align:middle line:84%
Which is of course the
conventional measure that we

00:47:16.655 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
all keep being told would
measure economic health.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the only study.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The World Values
Surveys-- in 2000,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.130 align:middle line:84%
they finally decided
to look at gender.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And they found that those
world regions-- and this

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.800 align:middle line:84%
was, again, a study of values
worldwide-- that those world

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.680 align:middle line:84%
regions where the
status of women

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is higher, where women are not
viewed as having to be confined

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.820 align:middle line:84%
under male control in the
household, that not only

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:84%
was there a higher
quality of life,

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.910 align:middle line:84%
but more civil rights
and more democracy.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:58.560 align:middle line:84%
A third study-- and
again, these are

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.040 align:middle line:84%
all quantitative,
statistical studies--

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is the gender gap study
that is now annually being

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.347 align:middle line:84%
done by the World
Economic Forum.

00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you
look at the findings,

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.230 align:middle line:84%
you see that those nations
that have the smallest gender

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:84%
gap-- because unfortunately,
every nation in our world

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:23.630 align:middle line:84%
still has one-- that those
are the nations where there

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:84%
is a higher general
quality of life.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this?

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
are many reasons.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:90%
One is very simple.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Women are half the population.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But not only are we
half the population,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.090 align:middle line:84%
but we are the
half that is still

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
entrusted with caring
for young children.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So when a society deprives,
as so many world cultures

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.810 align:middle line:84%
still do, with traditions
of horrible discrimination

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
against girls and women--
not only equal health care,

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.150 align:middle line:84%
equal food, equal
education, we're really

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:06.062 align:middle line:84%
affecting future
generations, aren't we?

00:49:06.062 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think this whole thing
about the status of women--

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:84%
remember, when
you saw that clip,

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that that's one of
the components that

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is very important in
whether a society orients

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to the domination system
or the partnership system.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And in these Nordic nations
that we just talked about,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:84%
women are 40%--
four zero percent--

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:90%
of the national legislature.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.674 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, amazing.

00:49:34.674 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: All right, well,
we should be 50%, really.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.107 align:middle line:90%
We're half the population.

00:49:38.107 --> 00:49:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But the
point of it is this:

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.490 align:middle line:84%
it's not only women who voted
for more caring policies-- men.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It's because as the
status of women rises,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.570 align:middle line:84%
men no longer feel it's such
a threat to their status,

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to their quote,
masculinity, to embrace

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.260 align:middle line:84%
these more feminine,
more caring policies.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And this did not
happen in a vacuum.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I really want to say this.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.630 align:middle line:84%
It happened because
these nations moved more

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.330 align:middle line:90%
to the partnership side.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They have much more
democracy and equality

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in both the family
and the state.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's not as
much of a gender gap there.

00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Not as
much of a gender

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.390 align:middle line:84%
gap, but that's not
the only factor.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, they also
are in the forefront

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:84%
in the world--
remember when I said

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:84%
force fear is part of
a domination system?

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It keeps it together?

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:33.610 align:middle line:84%
They're at the
forefront of trying

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to leave those
traditions behind.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The first peace studies came
out of the Nordic nations.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The first laws saying
that it's against the law

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.366 align:middle line:84%
to use physical discipline
against children and families--

00:50:46.366 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Came out of
the Nordic nations?

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.198 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yes, and they also
have a very strong men's

00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:54.590 align:middle line:84%
movement to disentangle quote,
masculinity, from its dominator

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:84%
entanglement with
domination, with violence,

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.970 align:middle line:90%
that that's the real man.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's because they've
moved in that direction.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we really
still marginalize

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:09.390 align:middle line:84%
these so-called women's
issues, we're missing the boat.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We can't understand that it's--
as long as women are ranked

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.990 align:middle line:84%
as inferior to men, as long as
men are supposed to dominate

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.520 align:middle line:84%
women, which is what
a lot of the gender--

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:84%
the war of the sexes
is about, really.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Women manipulate,
because they're not

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:90%
supposed to control.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But as long as women are
devalued, so also will

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:38.670 align:middle line:84%
these stereotypically
feminine, caring, care giving,

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:42.760 align:middle line:84%
nonviolence-- it's not realistic
to expect more caring policies

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
as long as we don't really
globally, globally raise

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.587 align:middle line:90%
the status of women.

00:51:48.587 --> 00:51:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the good news
is that there's now

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:90%
a Global Women's Movement.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How is that
affecting the United States?

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.805 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the
United States, of course,

00:51:55.805 --> 00:51:56.990 align:middle line:90%
has been in a regression.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Whereas all the other
industrialized nations

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.700 align:middle line:84%
have been moving more
towards caring policies,

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.360 align:middle line:84%
we have been moving
back from them.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And this whole-- really, it's a
red herring about the deficit.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
question of priorities.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Do we give corporate
welfare or do

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
we invest in early
childhood education?

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make a
very important point here,

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:84%
because I always
believe that you've

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
got to show people who are
very much in this old paradigm

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:90%
that caring is successful.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And as we move-- and
this is really basic--

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:41.640 align:middle line:84%
we are moving into a whole
new technological age,

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
post-industrial era,

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.720 align:middle line:90%
from the manufacturing era.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Robotics is coming down
the road, automation.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the manufacturing
jobs never will come back.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Economists never
tire of telling us

00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.480 align:middle line:84%
that the most important capital
for this knowledge service

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.210 align:middle line:84%
post-industrial economy is
high quality, human capital.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:10.230 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed, it
starts in early childhood.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
If we don't invest in
caring for our children,

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in parenting education, in
high quality early childhood

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.560 align:middle line:84%
education, in paid parental
leave, in health care,

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in-- this country has the
highest child poverty rates,

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.580 align:middle line:84%
this wealthy United States,
of any developed nation,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.059 align:middle line:84%
as well as the highest
maternal mortality rates.

00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I knew that, yes.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Now, what
does that tell us?

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.896 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.896 --> 00:53:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Undervalued.

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: The nations that
I'm talking about now--

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Sweden, Finland, Norway--
have very low poverty rates,

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.800 align:middle line:84%
very low woman
headed poverty rates,

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.600 align:middle line:84%
woman-headed family
poverty rates.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you attribute
that to the fact

00:53:55.308 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that that is more of a
female-dominated system?

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's not
female dominated.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.465 align:middle line:90%
Women are only 40%, anyway.

00:54:02.465 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: It's hardly that.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:05.798 align:middle line:84%
I attribute that to
the fact that they've

00:54:05.798 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:84%
moved to more gender equity,
to more gender balance,

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and to the fact that they've
moved more to the partnership

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:17.650 align:middle line:84%
configuration, of which
gender is an important piece.

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think we really have
to pay attention to that.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Because those nations have
very successful economies

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and very low crime
rates, for example.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
say that they have

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.822 align:middle line:90%
a lot of woman-headed families.

00:54:32.822 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We're always being
told that that's

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.020 align:middle line:90%
the problem with poverty.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But they have very low,
very low poverty rates

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.650 align:middle line:84%
for woman-headed
families because they

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:45.337 align:middle line:84%
have the social
support for caring.

00:54:45.337 --> 00:54:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Women-headed families
meaning that the female is

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:90%
the primary--

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:50.132 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: That's
right, that's right.

00:54:50.132 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --earner.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:53.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now in the
United States, though,

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.880 align:middle line:84%
we have dual-income families,
many, many-- so this is--

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So also in Sweden
and Norway, by the way.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what we
don't have is the systems

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that support the
dual-income families?

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: That's really
what we're talking about,

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is do we support
caring and care giving?

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Do we have caring policies?

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
better understand

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have to start with
different measures of what

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.665 align:middle line:90%
is economically productive.

00:55:22.665 --> 00:55:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that we're working

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
on through our Center for
Partnership Studies Caring

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Economy Campaign.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the old measures--
GDP, Gross Domestic Product--

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.090 align:middle line:90%
are crazy.

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:39.316 align:middle line:84%
They include activities
that harm and take life.

00:55:39.316 --> 00:55:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Making cigarettes--
the medical costs,

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:84%
the funeral costs--
they're all great for GDP.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Oil spills-- wonderful for
GDP-- the cleanup costs,

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
the lawsuits.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But not only-- and this is
the point, now-- not only

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.780 align:middle line:84%
do these old measures include
as positive negatives,

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.410 align:middle line:84%
they fail to include
as productive work

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in their measures of so-called
economic health the most

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.650 align:middle line:84%
important human work,
the life-sustaining work.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So I've proposed, really, a
full spectrum economic map

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't just include
the market, the government,

00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and the legal economy, but that
also includes the household

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:36.270 align:middle line:84%
economy, the unpaid
volunteer economy,

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and the natural economy.

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, very important to
include-- very, very important

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:42.180 align:middle line:90%
to include.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.980 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that our media
shapes women in the world,

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.560 align:middle line:90%
here in the US specifically?

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And how does that compare
to other countries?

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, of course, we've
exported a lot of our media.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So by now I don't think
that any country--

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's true.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is true.

00:56:59.120 --> 00:56:59.523 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:59.523 --> 00:57:00.773 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --is immune from us.

00:57:00.773 --> 00:57:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, years
ago when I was in Denmark--

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.329 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the situation is now.

00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:08.245 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those nations,
the Nordic nations,

00:57:08.245 --> 00:57:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that are doing so much better,
have more equality, et cetera.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More progressive, yes.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They didn't show
the kind of television

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.257 align:middle line:90%
that we show.

00:57:17.257 --> 00:57:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They didn't.

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But probably
by today they do.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well I notice
when I-- as I said,

00:57:23.455 --> 00:57:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I have a young child.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I-- on my drive to school
I've had to change my route

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because there are pornography
ads on the side of the road.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.650 align:middle line:84%
There's even network
television ads

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that are showing more and
more examples of women just

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:45.120 align:middle line:84%
being symbols rather than
human beings any longer.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So I can only avoid
those routes for so long.

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
conversation that goes along

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.640 align:middle line:84%
with it, that has to
explain to my young daughter

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that a woman is more
than a sex symbol.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: You know,
the objectification

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of the human beings is part
of the domination system.

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an instrumental view
of another human being, one

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.760 align:middle line:90%
that you can control.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It unfortunately is not new.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.416 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: This is
something that--

00:58:15.416 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just the
line has gotten blurred.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been pushed
more and more lately.

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, it's
an interesting thing.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.310 align:middle line:84%
As I wrote in my book,
"Sacred Pleasure,"

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:30.240 align:middle line:84%
the so-called sexual
revolution had two sides.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It had a very healthy side,
which was yeah, sex is normal.

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Sex is pleasurable.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Sex is--

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Yeah,
as long as there--

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I actually proposed,
in that book,

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that we need an ethic for sexual
relations of at least some

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:48.540 align:middle line:84%
modicum of caring
for each other.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Because all's fair in love
and war is a dominator--

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Model, yes.

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --model.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about it
is that there was also

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:02.060 align:middle line:84%
a very unhealthy part
of that, which was still

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.900 align:middle line:84%
within the domination
system, that for example,

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.570 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing
became well, women

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have to be available
at all times to men.

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, with this
terrible sexualization

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of little girls-- and I'm
afraid our corporations

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:22.130 align:middle line:84%
are very much to blame
for a lot of that.

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:24.588 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, because
they make money off it.

00:59:24.588 --> 00:59:25.296 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:59:25.296 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And they
manipulate and market.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But see, they couldn't
be so successful--

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we
really have to understand--

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.670 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't have this
embedded thing that women

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:41.517 align:middle line:90%
are sex objects.

00:59:41.517 --> 00:59:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.891 align:middle line:84%
That's true-- actually, there
is a clip here that shows that.

00:59:44.891 --> 00:59:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It shows, in the media, how
many different ways that we

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.380 align:middle line:90%
perceive women.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: In our
time, when so much

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:56.830 align:middle line:84%
of the education that
young people are receiving

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is not at school-- it's
from the larger culture,

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and particularly from the media.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, before a child
even starts school,

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:08.550 align:middle line:84%
they've already had a huge
part of their education.

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And what are they really
being educated for?

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So much of what
they're educated for

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is to value qualities, behaviors
appropriate for dominator

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
rather than partnership,
relations-- qualities

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors that
cause so many problems.

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Think about in action
entertainment, in the news.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.110 align:middle line:90%
What do we focus on?

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Violence, killing, hurting.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
You look at sitcoms, and so much
of them-- they seem innocent,

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:41.679 align:middle line:84%
but they make cruelty, cynicism,
insensitivity seem fun.

01:00:41.679 --> 01:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY SEINFELD: Well you see,
the thing of it is, you know,

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of ugly people
out there walking around,

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know they're
ugly because nobody actually

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.460 align:middle line:90%
tells them.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE COSTANZA:
So what's your point?

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: You look at
some of the talk shows,

01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and they capitalize
on human suffering.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
This gives young people a
very, very distorted view

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.210 align:middle line:84%
of what it really
means to be human,

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
a very partial, one-sided view.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So schools have an enormous
responsibility here.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And yes, media literacy skill's
informed by this partnership

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
dominator continuum
as an analytical lens.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
They're really vital
self defense strategies

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.430 align:middle line:90%
for young people.

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Even more so than
in the curriculum,

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
the gender stereotypes and the
relations between women and men

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.560 align:middle line:90%
are so misrepresented.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We're led to believe
that everybody

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
has a wonderful time
in relations where

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.290 align:middle line:90%
girls and women are humiliated.

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Look at some of the
videos, the music videos.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
What's the message about what
is a good relationship, what's

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
a fun relationship?

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
only bad for girls.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It's very bad for
boys, because boys,

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
too-- they want that
caring connection,

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that good
relationship-- can't get

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.885 align:middle line:84%
that in that kind
of relationship.

01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:06.904 align:middle line:90%


01:02:06.904 --> 01:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
think that this

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
has changed the way that men
relate to women, in general?

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I don't think
it has really changed it.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Let me start with that.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go back--
every once in a while,

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I read an old novel, and
I was reading Trollope.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
They've done some
of his work on PBS.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And women were totally
under the control of men.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is not new.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: This is not new.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
What's new is the overt
sexualization of it.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%
But even that isn't new.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
If you look, for
example, at Greek vases,

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
you see scenes of intercourse.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
If you look at some of the
art that was commissioned

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
by inquisitors in
the Middle Ages,

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
you see the same kind of
torture of naked women

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
as you do in some of this
horrible modern pornography.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there was also
the historical statues and art

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of women being
displayed as beautiful

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and nurturing and feminine.

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a few of
these clips that you

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
shared with us,
of the goddesses.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well those, of
course, come from times

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
before the shift.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand that--
for example, in that procession

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
fresco, you have a
woman, a high priestess,

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
with priestesses and priests
coming with offerings of wine

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.520 align:middle line:90%
and of food.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.723 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But what
does that tell you?

01:03:44.723 --> 01:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It tells you a lot about
the kind of structure.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.295 align:middle line:90%
She isn't on a high pedestal.

01:03:49.295 --> 01:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They're not groveling, kneeling,
or prostrating themselves.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a partnership
society, isn't it?

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:59.554 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that a woman can
be the high priestess-- how

01:03:59.554 --> 01:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
does that compare
to what happened

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
after the shift, when
only men could be popes.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.587 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to reverse
it, but much, much too slowly.

01:04:09.587 --> 01:04:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You speak of this shift.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.044 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

01:04:12.044 --> 01:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I'm speaking about the
shift from more of an earlier

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
partnership direction
in civilization,

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in prehistory,
that I really write

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.910 align:middle line:84%
about quite a bit in "The
Chalice and the Blade"

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and in "Sacred Pleasure."

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.785 align:middle line:84%
By the way, "Chalice"
is now in 25 languages.

01:04:27.785 --> 01:04:29.577 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing, yes.

01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: The most
recent translations

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.682 align:middle line:84%
have been into
Urdu, for Pakistan.

01:04:34.682 --> 01:04:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh,
that's amazing.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it was
just acquired for Turkey.

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
So look, there are people
all over the world trying

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.545 align:middle line:84%
to shift to the
partnership side.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a textbook in
many universities, absolutely.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They're trying to
shift to the partnership side.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And this hidden history
is very helpful.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example, look at
the Venus of Laussel, which

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
was one of the slides,
the cave painting--

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
if we could have that
one for just a moment.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the next one, next one,
the next one after this.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.210 align:middle line:90%
There we are.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Now that comes-- it's from the
Paleolithic, or the Old Stone

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Age.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
That's about 20,000
to 25,000 years old.

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That was before the shift.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
The Minoan images that you saw
are about 10,000 years ago.

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But what's so interesting
is she's nude.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But there is nothing degrading
about her nakedness, is there?

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, and it
shows the uterus

01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
as being whole and
full and beautiful.

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it also
shows her holding a moon.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, she's
engraved at the opening

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.160 align:middle line:90%
of a cave sanctuary.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been some
kind of a ritual connecting

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
women's menstrual cycles
with the cycles of the moon.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:55.232 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where it used to be
the sacred feminine, yes.

01:05:55.232 --> 01:05:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: That's right.

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole different
kind of a thing, isn't it?

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now we
have pornography,

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
we have nighttime
episodic shows that

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:09.550 align:middle line:90%
are no longer family shows.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
How are we explaining
or portraying women?

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well, terribly.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.441 align:middle line:90%
Terribly is the short answer.

01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do we
teach this to young women?

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.398 align:middle line:84%
How do we teach young
girls about their bodies?

01:06:20.398 --> 01:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, I think
that it is something

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that is up to every
one of us to do.

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And there are tools for it.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
"Tomorrow's Children" has
a lot on media literacy.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a new film called
"Miss Representation," which

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
deals with how we are portrayed.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Look, women have to be
portrayed as human beings.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Sex is a wonderful part of
life, for both women and men.

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Women aren't just objects.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Women are really active sexual
partners given half a chance,

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and sex is so much
better that way.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: All the
studies show that.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So the old model really doesn't
particularly work for anybody.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
But, it's what we've inherited.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's being accentuated
now through this.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
difference between erotica

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and pornography.

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, erotica
is to simply focus

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
on the healthy, pleasure
giving, mutual pleasure giving.

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Pornography usually
has something

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
to do with at best
objectifying a woman,

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
or in gay pornography,
the man who plays

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
the part of the female
in the relationship,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and at worst dominating,
brutally beating, killing,

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
torturing.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's back
to the domination.

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: It's back to that.

01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:52.565 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't sex
that's the problem.

01:07:52.565 --> 01:07:55.180 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.564 align:middle line:90%
It's the domination element.

01:07:56.564 --> 01:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so interesting.

01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
has shaped, though,

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
the way that women and
men relate to each other,

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
even in relationships,
in parenting,

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.130 align:middle line:90%
across the board-- in dating.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And it does also, for
what I'm observing--

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have much
experience of this-- but looking

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.874 align:middle line:84%
as women are exposed,
or young girls

01:08:19.874 --> 01:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
are being exposed
more and more and more

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.395 align:middle line:84%
to sex, that they don't know how
to emotionally handle it at 13.

01:08:26.395 --> 01:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Well, they can't.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.379 align:middle line:90%
Their brains aren't developed.

01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But yet, they're
being pressured with it.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.464 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Oh my
gosh, it is really--

01:08:34.464 --> 01:08:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's very confusing.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: It's not
only confusing.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's immoral in the
true sense of the word.

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Not because sex is immoral,
but because this brainwashing

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
little girls into thinking
that their whole value is

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
in how much they deliver
sexually to boys--

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and that's where
they get validation and they

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:57.784 align:middle line:84%
determine their self worth
and their societal status,

01:08:57.784 --> 01:08:58.951 align:middle line:90%
is by that validation from--

01:08:58.951 --> 01:09:00.992 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, the only
way it's going to change

01:09:00.992 --> 01:09:02.220 align:middle line:90%
is if we take a strong stand.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.261 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to
say you're being prudish.

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And the response to that is
not in the least being prudish.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.160 align:middle line:90%
We're being realistic.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.535 align:middle line:84%
We're taking into
account what we

01:09:10.535 --> 01:09:12.229 align:middle line:90%
know about brain development.

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:13.729 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Self respect.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: The human
brain doesn't fully

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.700 align:middle line:90%
develop until the early 20s.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
That early, they don't have
the capacity to evaluate.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.874 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or the life experience.

01:09:24.874 --> 01:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Or the
life experience--

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:28.102 align:middle line:90%
so this is really--

01:09:28.102 --> 01:09:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a big challenge.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: --unacceptable.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

01:09:31.211 --> 01:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And if we
had an understanding,

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
a public understanding,
of this and if we

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't have this--
freedom of speech always

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
has to be balanced
against other interests.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you know, it
also does need addressing.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:50.484 align:middle line:90%
Because it is happening.

01:09:50.484 --> 01:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It is reality that teenagers
are, at 12 and 13, having sex.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's all over
the Disney Channel.

01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely in our reality.

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So do we give children,
which they still

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
are-- teenagers-- tools
to be able to handle that?

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Of course
we need sex education.

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
We need education that
explains the emotional issues--

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're really
not ready for it.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Not this nonsense
about abstinence.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.535 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But that is this
what you really want, or do

01:10:21.535 --> 01:10:23.540 align:middle line:90%
you want a caring connection?

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.370 align:middle line:84%
If you want a
satisfying relationship,

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:27.926 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to go in for this.

01:10:27.926 --> 01:10:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But they also need to
know the facts of life.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.866 align:middle line:90%
They're going to learn them.

01:10:30.866 --> 01:10:32.390 align:middle line:84%
My God, they're

>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

01:10:33.389 --> 01:10:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And they need to
know about contraception.

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Look, that 13-year-olds are
having sex is nothing new.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely true.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Worldwide, that
is the age of puberty,

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
hormones start raging.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%

marriage happens at 15, 16.

>>EISLER: Which is
really lousy for girls,

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%

how women's human rights--
how they're made child brides,

how genital mutilation--
all these horrible things.

01:11:10.862 --> 01:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Which we really
need to understand.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they're part of even
more rigid domination systems.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.247 align:middle line:84%
And as long as those
exist, by the way--

01:11:18.247 --> 01:11:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They will be acceptable.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: They
will be acceptable.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But they will also
reinforce the domi--

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I have to make this statement,
which is when children learn

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that one kind of person is
superior to another kind

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of person-- that beginning with
the most fundamental difference

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in humans, between
female and male,

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
difference is to be equated
with either superiority

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
or inferiority, with
dominating or being dominated,

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
with being served or serving--
that is in their heads.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a template for a different
race being treated that way,

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
for a different ethnic group
being treated that way.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Any difference then becomes
equated with either superiority

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.110 align:middle line:90%
or inferiority.

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get back to
gender to really understand

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that this is an early
model for relations.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
change that, we will

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.232 align:middle line:84%
continue to have
domination systems.

01:12:19.232 --> 01:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%

We've all felt it.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So the old model,

That's the pure dominator model.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
this is something

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that is not a question
of women against men

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.400 align:middle line:90%
or men against women.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of both women

our full humanity.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Women can be leaders, which they

ball-breaking bitches
and all of the rest.

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And men can be

But unfortunately, the
old dominator models

01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.100 align:middle line:90%
are still strong.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.670 align:middle line:90%
But look around you.

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You probably find
people who have it.

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I am very blessed.

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I have it in my own marriage

happens to be a very caring man.

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And some women aren't
caring, by the way.

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important aspects

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:27.780 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution of love.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Because by the
grace of evolution,

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
we humans receive biochemical
rewards of enormous pleasure,

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.890 align:middle line:84%
not only when we are
loved or cared for,

01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
but also when we love or care
for another, be it a child,

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
be it a friend, be it a
lover, be it even a pet.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
We all have experienced
this, but it's

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:52.330 align:middle line:84%
left out of the
conventional narratives.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And it needs to be put in.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're back, really,
to "Tomorrow's Children"

01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and to what I call teaching
meaningful evolution,

01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:07.060 align:middle line:84%
showing it contrary to what
we see so much emphasized

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to our capacity for
violence-- which

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.012 align:middle line:84%
we have, as human
beings, women, too.

01:21:12.012 --> 01:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's part
of survival, yes.

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:16.315 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well,
it's part of-- today

01:21:16.315 --> 01:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
it isn't very much
part of survival.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:19.991 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, an old
part of old survival.

01:21:19.991 --> 01:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Maybe if
you were-- but we

01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
don't have any saber tooth
tigers around the corner.

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But our DNA
doesn't know that.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Our DNA
does know that.

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%
DNA does change.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
counts is the interaction

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of our genes with
our experiences.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And our experiences
are culturally shaped,

01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
as mediated by families,
education, religion, politics,

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:45.150 align:middle line:90%
economics.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
good point, yes.

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Everything that
we've talked about-- well,

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.510 align:middle line:90%
we know this from science.

01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, that's true.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:49.599 align:middle line:90%
Epigenetics.

01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:50.380 align:middle line:90%
You are right.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: So we
really need to change

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the way we teach
evolution and emphasize

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
the enormous capacity, with
the emergence of our species,

01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:03.260 align:middle line:90%
for caring, for love.

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, you have given
us such a beautiful view

01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of how things definitely are
possible in the way-- you're

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
doing it.

01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.060 align:middle line:90%
You're shaping change.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You're such a
visionary in this way.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful
that you're here

01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to explain how
applicable this is, how it's

01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
just an action away
from happening,

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that we, by understanding our
history, can change our future,

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
which we talked about
at the very beginning.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to just touch really
quickly on the working mother

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
concept we were talking
about before we watched that.

01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
How do you think the
working mother has changed

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
the way that we're
raising children?

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Well, you hear
a lot about how terrible

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
it is that women don't
stay home and take

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:48.210 align:middle line:90%
care of their children.

01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:49.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've heard that a lot.

01:22:49.822 --> 01:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: But that's
because people

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.090 align:middle line:90%
don't know their history.

01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they also don't
use their common sense.

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
old farm family,

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that woman was not taking
care of her children.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.070 align:middle line:90%
It was usually--

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She was working.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: She was working on
the field, milking the cows,

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.300 align:middle line:90%
cooking for the--

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tending the fields, yes.

01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:11.905 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: And it was usually the
oldest child, the oldest girl--

01:23:11.905 --> 01:23:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That raised--

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --who took
care of the children.

01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And you still see that very much
in many parts of the developing

01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:19.880 align:middle line:90%
world today.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.807 align:middle line:84%
So that's a myth, the
way we never were, OK?

01:23:22.807 --> 01:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I love that perspective, yes.

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: All right,
so it isn't really

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.370 align:middle line:90%
the quantity, anyway, of time.

01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the quality of time.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's also our understanding
of what good parenting is.

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know now that this
fear and force based parenting

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.110 align:middle line:90%
is not good parenting.

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, but co-parenting
is a really good solution

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.835 align:middle line:84%
to that, where both the men
and the women co-parent.

01:23:46.835 --> 01:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EISLER: Absolutely.

01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it's wonderful
that men now, as the gender

01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
stereotypes are blurring,
as we're moving more

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to the partnership
side, really don't

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
feel so threatened to
their status by going it.

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And whereas it
comes to single mothers,

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
there's an economic
system that needs

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to support single mothers
more by giving more

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.294 align:middle line:84%
time for childcare
and more support.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Absolutely, but
it needs to also support--

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Single fathers.

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: --and
two parent couples.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: That we are the only--
the only-- developed nation

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that does not have
government supported

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
paid parental leave, that does
not invest in high quality

01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
early childhood
education, that does not

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
have universal
childcare-- well, we

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
see it in the high
infant mortality rates.

01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We're the highest-- in
the highest poverty rates.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.190 align:middle line:90%
That's not being a superpower.

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
That is being really symptom of
a regression to the domination

01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
side.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And we have to use the
current economic crisis,

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
where we can see that the
old system isn't working,

01:24:55.490 --> 01:25:00.227 align:middle line:84%
as an opportunity to
invest in-- just let's

01:25:00.227 --> 01:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
put it in purely economic
terms-- in our human capital,

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and give government support
for caring and care giving.

01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we're investing
in our competitiveness

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.560 align:middle line:84%
as a nation in the
post-industrial knowledge

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.350 align:middle line:90%
service economy.

01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
That is a very
powerful argument.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
the Occupy Movement

01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
start talking about
a caring economy,

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
not just with what's
wrong, but what

01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
can really, fundamentally
change the values.

01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:37.285 align:middle line:84%
Because economics is
about what we value.

01:25:37.285 --> 01:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is very
well put-- very well put.

01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you quote
Margaret Mead in this next clip.

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
She says it very well, as well.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.856 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a look
at that really quickly.

01:25:45.856 --> 01:25:48.420 align:middle line:90%


01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: I want to close
by reminding us of something

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that Margaret Mead pointed out,
that the only thing that ever

01:25:56.290 --> 01:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
brought about positive change
is a group of dedicated women

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and men.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's be that group of
dedicated women and men.

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's join together to
really make that difference,

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to send a steady stream of
pressure and information

01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and, yes, new thinking to our
policymakers, to our neighbors,

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to our friends, to everyone
in our sphere of influence.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's do what we
need to do to move

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
to that economic system
that is so urgently needed

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
at this critical time in human
history, an economic system

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that gives visibility
and value to the most

01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
important human work, the
work of caring for people,

01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
starting in childhood, and
caring for our Mother Earth.

01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to
join me and the Center

01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:59.775 align:middle line:84%
for Partnership Studies in
this exciting and urgently

01:26:59.775 --> 01:27:01.610 align:middle line:90%
needed enterprise.

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it for ourselves,
for our children,

01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:08.220 align:middle line:90%
and for generations to come.

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.350 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And let's
do it together.

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm so inspired by that.

01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so inspired by
you, and motivated as well.

01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have opened
my mind to so many

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%
wonderful possibilities.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
I so appreciate you.

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.170 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISLER: Oh, well
thank you my dear Lisa.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.519 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I thank you.

01:27:26.519 --> 01:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for your
work, and for all

01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:30.711 align:middle line:84%
that you've given to us, and
the perspectives that you shared

01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:32.360 align:middle line:84%
with us this afternoon,
and everything

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that you've done to move us
forward for social change.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You are really one
of the true pioneers.

01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But you're also one of
the ones making it happen.
