00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
My guest today has a story
that is beyond belief.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, it'll take
a leap of faith to listen to.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.445 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that Michael
Tamura is here to tell his story

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.399 align:middle line:90%
Michael Tamura is my guest.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
He has been a spiritual
teacher for over 38 years.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the past
decade, he has had

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
five experiences
where he physically

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:90%
died for a period of time.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And he came back with
very powerful messages

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to
share with us today.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
His story is very,
very worth telling.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And listen closely
for the lessons

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:90%
that you're about to hear.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
here, Lisa. [CHUCKLE]

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: I truly mean that.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have known
Michael for a long time.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:10%
I've known Michael
for about 20 years.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And I've been through
all of his classes,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
and the teachings,
and the learning.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:10%
So to have you here after
what you've experienced

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:10%
and the people that have
learned from you over the past,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:10%
it's really, really wonderful.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to
share your story,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:90%
and I want to get into that.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.955 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk a
little bit about your 38

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
years of teaching, and
what it is you have been

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
teaching over all these years?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's funny, because
even though outwardly,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:10%
I haven't said to
a lot of people,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:10%
I teach you how
to die correctly.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.256 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLE]

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.671 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, I've
never really gotten that.

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's really what I've
been teaching for 38 years.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, three years
before my mother died, all

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, she recalled that
when she was pregnant with me,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
she said there was this young
Japanese-- we were in Japan,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of course-- and this Japanese
college student ran over

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to her with a deck of cards
and said, Mrs. Tamura,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I have to give your
baby a reading.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.891 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know what that
meant at the time, never heard

00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
of that.
And so she said OK.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And he dealt out the
cards, and then he said,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
well, your baby is a boy,
and he's strong and healthy.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that part she
said, what mother

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to hear that?

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And so she said, oh, how nice.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And then she said it wasn't
until when I was 40 years old

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and she's telling me this story
that she connected the dots,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
she said after that, he
said when your son grows up,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be a spiritual
teacher and a healer

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and go all over the world
teaching and healing people.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't remember
that until you were 40.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: No, she didn't.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
She said it just
went over her head.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know what
that meant or anything.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we were
sitting down talking.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about a lot
of the things I was just doing.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh,
this was predicted

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.114 align:middle line:90%
before you were even born.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came in to
this lifetime, a lot of people

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
don't remember what
it's like to be a baby.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But I remember quite a bit of
what it's like to be a baby.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And the body's a baby,
but you're not. [CHUCKLE]

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: As spirit.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like I am now,
except in a little body.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLE] And nobody
listens to you. [CHUCKLE]

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.111 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So the consciousness
of being a full human is there,

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
but you just can't--
MICHAEL TAMURA: Absolutely.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.395 align:middle line:90%
---express it quite yet.

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And I was
aware I'm here to teach.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You were
aware of that as a baby?

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:90%
As a child.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
And I kept on trying to do that.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have a
very good audience.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Nobody--

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Worms, lizards, those are my--

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Worms would listen to
me, little critters,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:90%
and they were my friends.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So early on in my
life, I realized

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I have to become an old man
before people would start

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:90%
to listen to what I had to say.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.456 align:middle line:84%
And I guess now I had
to die a few times.

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLE]
LISA GARR: I really get it.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.709 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to keep--
But actually when you said

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%
that, that makes sense to me.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of your
teachings are the fact

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are
consciousness, and that

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
blend between life and
death is really very thin

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:90%
when you think about it.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And your experiences
really show that.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah, exactly
because most people's concept

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of death is the
physical death, right?

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The body is born,
and then it dies.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.755 align:middle line:84%
But for the soul's perspective,
death isn't anything like that.

00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Death is letting go, and
moving on, and learning.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So not to get hung up on what
already happened, but really

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
being able to realize that,
oh, what's important to me

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.741 align:middle line:84%
is my next step, my
what do I choose next.

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you can do that
within this lifetime, too.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.606 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: That's right.

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:51.876 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to get rid of
the body to do that. [CHUCKLE]

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Apparently not.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So in your years of
teaching, and now

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
you teach all over
the world, I have

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:84%
a couple of pictures that show
of your teaching experiences.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:90%
You've been to India to teach.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes,
that was an experience.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.815 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
photo, what are you doing?

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
If there's a blessing that
happens before the teaching?

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes, I'm
being honored at the beginning

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:90%
as the teacher.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
devotional culture,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and a very high respect
for a spiritual teacher.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they honored me with
the garland and everything.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And she brings the candle
light, the oil lamp,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm to transfer the
light from the oil lamp

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
to the main altar.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And before I start the teaching.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- oh, I see.
So that--

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.613 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: So
that's what we're doing.

00:05:40.613 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --sets the space,
so to speak, for the teaching.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the other places
that you have taught,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
of course, back in Hawaii.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Now did you live in Hawaii
for a period of time?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.014 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
No, I feel like it.

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It looks like you do.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.313 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: I
feel right at home.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.321 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It looks like it.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: The two places
where I feel right at home

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:10%
is Mount Shasta, where I do
live currently, and Hawaii.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yeah, it looks like--
I mean, the joy on your face

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:10%
there is amazing.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.855 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to see
throughout the experiences

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that you've had, which were
pretty brutal experiences,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.245 align:middle line:84%
you come back to this place
after every experience

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:90%
that you've had.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:90%
It's quite phenomenal.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in many
of your lectures.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that you do, and you have

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:10%
an amazing clairvoyant
ability where you're

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:10%
able to see into people's pasts,
futures, many different layers

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:10%
of their lifetime.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.227 align:middle line:84%
What is that experience
like when you do see that?

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: I've
always had that.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
That part started
off when I was real

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
little as more mathematical.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I would see geometry.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I walked up to you
like this, in between us,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
there would be this geometrical
shape, very intricate.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Dolphins have that.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Swimming with the dolphins,
especially in Hawaii,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
they've showed me the very thing
that I used to see as a child.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they know how to
communicate that way.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:90%
But humans--

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:90%
We have shapes inside us, yeah.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
When I would point it out to
people, they didn't understand.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And in a childlike
fashion, every time

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't understand,
I'd go, oh, that didn't work.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
establish communication.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And every time I said that
didn't work about something,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:90%
it disappeared.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
undo our abilities.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:90%
We stop ourselves.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:90%
We close down.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when the geometrical
things went away,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
then I start to see auras--
what I know now as auras.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the time I'm six,
seven, eight years old.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was no words that
I knew in my vocabulary.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else talked about it.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Were they
just colors, shadows?

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I used to say people had
colored clouds around them.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And the colored clouds
would change colors.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would know
what they're going

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:90%
through by looking at that.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But when I tried to tell
people, especially adults,

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
it was like-- [CHUCKLE]

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's interesting,
because the colors, over time,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
as you started to see
colors more and more,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
did certain colors start to
identify with certain meanings?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And before I got to
that point as a child,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I ran into the same problem.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to
establish communication

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:90%
with people on that level.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, well,
that didn't work either.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And I never quite lost the aura.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I always saw the
aura, except it faded

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
into the background a little bit
more, not up front and intense.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Except when somebody got
very intense emotionally

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and intently.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Then the aura would come
forward, very vividly.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But in normal situations, kind
of the noise of this world

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.478 align:middle line:90%
eclipsed it a little bit.

00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:41.144 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But when you
look at people these days,

00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
and you see someone
who's very, very bright--

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
Like you. [LAUGHS]

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.405 align:middle line:90%
Like I feel when I'm with you.

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we have a picture
of you giving a lecture.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And in the picture,
there's people

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
who are very, very bright,
and just the room, to me,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:90%
exudes brightness.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's because I've been
in one of those rooms,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and I know that feeling
after you have done

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:90%
a six, seven-hour workshop.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And the layers of
heaviness come off of you.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you're left with
just brightness in your soul,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:90%
you just beam.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And it goes beyond you.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So you see that in
people all the time

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.946 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: All the time.

00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:90%
You see light emanating.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And do you see the opposite?

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you see where
someone's closed down?

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I always can see the
light within a person.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
But many people cover it over.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's like wearing
a cloak around them.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so from the outside,
it looks dark, or darker.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when I say
somebody's very bright,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that means they're not
covering it over as much.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Do you think
people cover their light

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because they maybe got
invalidated for shining

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%
it too brightly once?

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes, and
they're afraid-- afraid

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
of what people are going to
think if they're too bright.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because people who can't have
that, who have a hard time

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
having people being bright.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's like misery
loves company, you know.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm miserable, I don't
want you to be happy.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like that.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And those people
will migrate towards each other.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And really, what it really is
their auras matching, right?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, their energy matches
and they get into sync.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
people come together

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and start doing things,
or living closer together.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vibration likeness.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And is it
a soul match as well?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Often, as
souls we plan before we

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
come into the incarnation.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
We plan who we're going to be
with, what we're going to do.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a script that
you follow exactly to the T,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:84%
but pretty much you know what's
going to happen in your life,

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
because that's your plan.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
going to school.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You know that you're going
to go to medical school,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:90%
or law school, or art school.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So you know what you're
going to be going into,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
even though you might
not know exactly how it's

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
going to play out every day.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So you know, so
that when you get there,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
then it seems, in
some way, familiar

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
or you have planned it?
MICHAEL TAMURA: Exactly.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: So then you
go, oh, I'm in the right place,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not in the
right place. [LAUGHS]

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So, did that happen to you when
you had your first experience,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.945 align:middle line:90%
when you actually--

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:25.469 align:middle line:84%
-Oh yes.
-It did?

00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
You felt that this was--

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
The right place.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, how I ended up
there was I was very, very

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
sick, having this
thing called traveling

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
gout all over the body.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:10%
I've gone through a
lot of pain in my life,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:10%
physical pain and stuff.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing like
the pain I was in then.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:10%
On the scale of zero
to 10, it was 50.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's all over.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it got so bad, and
I was pretty emaciated.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Raphaelle got very
perturbed because she said I

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
looked like a prisoner of war.
LISA GARR: Your wife?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that day, that late
afternoon, she was gone,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and I was by myself at home.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I just crawled into
bed in a dark room.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't do anything.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And it got to so bad that
I'm lying there going,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to God,
and I'm saying,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
longer I can handle this.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.906 align:middle line:90%
And, [SNAP] bam!

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm taken out.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of my body,
and I'm being escorted

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:90%
by this great, beautiful being.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm being escorted into
this-- like a conference room.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Except it's not like
a business energy,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:90%
it's more like a church.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a very holy place.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now when you
say "bam," you mean you,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.396 align:middle line:90%
as consciousness, lifted out--

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:46.995 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Of my body.
-Pain was gone?

00:12:46.995 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Pain was completely gone.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.155 align:middle line:84%
And then not even
gone, no thought of it.

00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like one moment you're
in excruciating pain.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:90%
The next moment, what pain?

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what body?

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.045 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It was real,
it was a real feeling

00:13:01.045 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
that you were experiencing.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, and very familiar.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And I knew where I was.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into this
room and sat down.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was surrounded by
five other great beings,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.328 align:middle line:84%
one of them being that one
who escorted me to this room.

00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized
them as great lights.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And then when this first
communication came on,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
they all appeared
as people, as men.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
They were all men.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And the one next
to me was sitting

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%
at the head of the table.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And he looked like
a Viking king,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.209 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh.
---royalty.

00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Long blonde hair, very
muscular, very big.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And all white, a
dress like a robe.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the one
across from me was

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
in purple and gold,
very majestic-looking,

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:90%
and older face, and very wise.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're all very
wise, great beings.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there are five
of them around me.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So the six of us are
sitting in one end

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:90%
of like a long conference table.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing they said
was, it was a total welcome.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
In this level,
communication is complete.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not just words, it's
not just sound or anything.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just a whole experience
with your total being-ness.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's like being welcomed
by a whole group of people.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And that
moment is complete.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: It's complete.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And then the
next thing was congratulations.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a type of
congratulation experience

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that you've done a great job,
and that you have fulfilled way

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
beyond the call of
duty, and you've

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
accomplished way more than
you've set out to accomplish

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
in this incarnation.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, they were
saying I'm done with what

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I came to do here on Earth.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they gave me a choice--
would you like to stay here

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:84%
with us and continue your
spiritual work in teaching

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and guiding people's souls
from the spiritual realm,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
or would you like to go back
to the earthly existence

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.157 align:middle line:90%
and do more?

00:15:09.157 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And when you were
presented with the choice,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
did you have feelings or
emotions that you remember?

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.555 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes,
I was totally neutral.

00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
It was neither.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go, oh yes, I want
to do this or the that.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
There was no desire.
LISA GARR: I get it.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.389 align:middle line:84%
You weren't hooked by anything.
-Mm-mm.

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:90%
It was just totally neutral.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then I decided
to give it back to them.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I said OK, well,
instead of me making

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that decision, I like you to let
me know from your great wisdom

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and a larger
perspective than I have,

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
what would bring about
the most benefit,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
not just to myself,
but to anyone involved?

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And unanimously
and instantly, they

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
said it would be
of great benefit

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.024 align:middle line:90%
if you went back to Earth.

00:15:56.024 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.967 align:middle line:84%
And then what did you
feel at that point?

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Was that again in that
space of neutrality?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.733 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: It
was total neutrality.

00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Now, I mean.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed Raymond
Moody on Gaiam TV.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.257 align:middle line:84%
And the classic near-death
experience is what

00:16:09.257 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
you're describing right now.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I know you know Raymond.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
How does this differ
from that experience?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.231 align:middle line:84%
Was this a near-death
experience?

00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well,
I would say probably

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
medical documentation

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
or anything with what happened
to the body during that time.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.167 align:middle line:90%
All I know is when I came back--

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It was an experience.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:90%
My heart just went, ka-boom!

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And it kick-started again,
and I gasped for air.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know how
long I was out of the body.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.507 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: How did you feel
physically when you came back?

00:16:37.507 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
Well, the funny thing

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is when I said OK to coming
back, again, you're not

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:90%
thinking about anything here.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
It's on the drafting
table, and that's a plan.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the person-- the
being that escorted me there

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:90%
was going to escort me back.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I kind of turned
around to put my attention

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
back into my body, the pain
was searing, excruciating.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.625 align:middle line:84%
And I realized on
my way out, I said,

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to be of
any good to anybody,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need some
help healing the body,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
or else I won't be
able to function

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:90%
in the condition it's in.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And I heard them say,
"fine," as I'm going back.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And I came back
to the body-- boom!

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Everything kick-starts.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm gasping for air, and
my heart's going da-da-da-da.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I notice the
pain is still there.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
It's excruciating pain.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But I had so much more
of myself in energy

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that I could deal
with it now, where

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.984 align:middle line:90%
I was just fading fast before.

00:17:40.984 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.165 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if it was
perspective that brought

00:17:44.165 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:90%
you that, or was just you--

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.765 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Just more
ener-- more of myself.

00:17:48.765 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're in
pain, you tend to leave.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And I came back much more full.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
the next few months,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the experience was
completely being reborn.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:90%
The slate was clear.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
My life before leaving the body
and meeting with the council

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and afterward, coming back,
is completely different.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: In what way?

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
On the inside, I
felt totally new.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
when you have life,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
you know what you did yesterday,
and it carries over to today,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're continuing
that whole process.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I remembered what
happened yesterday

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:90%
and everything before.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But it was like starting
from right here.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.131 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Most of us don't
have those significant shifts

00:18:39.131 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:90%
overnight--

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.196 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah,
and this was over--

00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:84%
---without a pinnacle
moment happening.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.425 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew what
they said was true.

00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It was literally my experience
was I had another incarnation.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:90%
I started a new life.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.963 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
how long did it take

00:18:59.963 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:90%
you to get back on your feet?

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I knew that it
took me about two years

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to complete-- see, even though
I was finished in spirit,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
when I came back to the body,
there's things going on.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I had commitments,
and appointments,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and teaching commitments, and
things like that scheduled way

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had to
finish those commitments.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It took me two years to tie up
all the loose ends from my life

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.971 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So this happened
in around 2004, right?

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: 2004.
-OK, that experience.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.816 align:middle line:10%
And then two years later,
you had another experience?

00:19:38.816 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, interestingly enough,
shortly after I came back

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:10%
from the first one is
when my guide said,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:10%
OK, you need to stop doing
your private sessions

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:10%
and go full-time into teaching,
and writing, and getting

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:10%
your teachings out there more.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: I remember that.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So you were doing individual
readings for people

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:90%
that were phenomenal.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I've had those
experiences, and you

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
would move me forward lifetimes
of karma in those healings.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.017 align:middle line:84%
They're really healings
more than readings--

00:20:11.017 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Yep, exactly.
---really.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.821 align:middle line:84%
So you stopped doing
those, it was too much.

00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well,
it took me two years

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:90%
to tie up all the loose ends.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
people who ask.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And so finally about two
years later in July of 2006,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.002 align:middle line:90%
I had my first heart attack.

00:20:29.002 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.614 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: First, OK.
-Yeah.

00:20:31.614 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you're
laughing about this.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was going
to be the first one. [LAUGHS]

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was a nurse when I
was a teenager for three years,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
you don't know unless
you've experienced

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:90%
it what a heart attack is.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't fit the model, you
know, pain down your left arm,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and crushing chest pain,
and all that stuff.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have that.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the night before,
Raphaelle and myself,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
we were at a friend's
house healing center,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
actually, in Oregon.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And they did an
impromptu birthday

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
party for me when
they discovered

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:90%
my birthday was in four days.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So Monday night, we had
this birthday party.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And when that lady brings
the cake with the candles,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and she goes OK, close
your eyes and make a wish.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes, and even
though there was 50-something,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
60 people there
and lots of noise,

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
everything stopped
inside of myself.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Out there was
probably still noise.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was complete
quiet and stillness.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
There's not a
thought in my mind.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get a
thought in my mind.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It was just pure empty.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden in the middle

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is this golden light
that just starts

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to fill this empty
space, and just

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:90%
starts to fill it and fill it.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And I get this thought.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:10%
One thought that I had was,
oh, I would like to more

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:10%
fully embody the Christ,
the Christ consciousness,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:10%
the Christ energy.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, what a
great idea. [CHUCKLE]

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll make that my wish.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I opened
my eyes, blew out

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
the candles, everybody
clapped, and sang me happy

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:90%
birthday, and the party went on.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next
morning, I wake up.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in bed,
Raphaelle's already up

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:90%
feeding the dog and everything.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I can hear the
clattering in the kitchen.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I wake up to the space
of total limitless bliss.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:90%
It was just total bliss.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's just this little bit
of background awareness of I'm

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:90%
back in my body.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:90%
But most of it is this bliss.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
long I was in that space.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But then this little
thought comes in-- I

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:90%
have an important appointment.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This man is coming
from Israel to see

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
me to talk about the future
of children in the world.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh yeah, I need
to get dressed and everything.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I get out of bed, start
to walk, and it hits.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I don't
know what hit me.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:04.193 align:middle line:84%
I double over and I can't
quite even sit straight.

00:23:04.193 --> 00:23:06.365 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So you didn't
feel sick, you didn't feel--

00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Before that,
I felt nothing but bliss.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I'm having-- it's like pain,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't like
shooting pains or anything,

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:90%
crushing pains.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It was just all over, and I
didn't know what to make of it.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And my energy was going
all over the place.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And just then Raphaelle walks
in, and she goes, are you OK?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.887 align:middle line:90%
Are you having a heart attack?

00:23:29.887 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
She's the one who caught it.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, she
knew instantly, yeah.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.971 align:middle line:84%
And I go through my mind, and
back to my way-back nursing

00:23:35.971 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.427 align:middle line:84%
And I says, no, I don't see an
elephant sitting on my chest.

00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what, you know.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what it was
explained, yeah.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a
crushing chest pain,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have radiating
pain down my left arm.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And that at that time,
that's what we learned.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no,
I don't think so.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just massive energy
from something's going on.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Could you give me a healing?

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And Raphaelle is a
tremendous healer.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So she goes right to the couch
and starts giving me a healing.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving me a
little bit of relief,

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's still going
all over the place.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
around in circles.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
later on, Raphaelle

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
told me that when I was
walking around in circles

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I start-- I thought I
was groaning in pain.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But she said, no, no,
it was very specific.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.924 align:middle line:84%
You were chanting the
Jewish prayer for the dead.

00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh my goodness!

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:90%
I never even heard of it.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, I don't
know what that is.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how do you know?

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said well, I just
watched it on TV about a week

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:90%
or two weeks ago.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:84%
They had this whole
thing where they

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
did this whole Jewish
prayer for the dead thing.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And what was coming
out of your mouth

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
was exactly that, in
this whole intonation.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.933 align:middle line:90%
And as I went around in circles.

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Were you experiencing
pain throughout this?

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And kind
of total disorientation,

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing
which way was up.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Then all I knew was I had
to go outside in the grass.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And all I wanted to be
was on the green grass

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:90%
of our lawn in the backyard.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:90%
We're bounded by the forest.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful,
beautiful cloudless sunny day.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went outside-- this is
early in the morning, 8:30--

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and I went outside, and I
said, continue healing me,

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I just need to deal
with something.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I went, and as
soon as I got on the lawn,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I was on my knees.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I flopped over, my
head was on the ground.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't dead yet.
[LAUGHS] This was preliminary.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:90%
On the edge of my seat, OK.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But I found myself out
of my body probably 80%.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm floating out of my
body in this beautiful space.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm surrounded by
six spiritual masters,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:90%
great beings.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: The same ones?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Three of them were
same, and three

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
were different from
the council meeting.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And but I recognized them.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's very specific.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they surrounded
me all the way around.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought was, thank
God you're here, I need help.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I expected them to swoop
in and save me or something.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But they all went
back away from me.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:84%
All in unison, they
were, whatever,

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:90%
ten feet away from me.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And now they're 20
feet away from me.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my God.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They didn't abandon me.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I can feel their support,
but the communication

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.117 align:middle line:84%
was, this is your time, and
you need to make a choice.

00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now, were
you aware of your body

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:90%
at all on the ground?

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Was there pain?
There was this--

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well, the body
was kind of in the background.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't so aware
of the body anymore.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I was right in that space
of I need to make a choice.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And when these guys give
instructions like that,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I listen.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going, OK, I
need to make a choice.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a choice do I make?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I already know that
I've already died once,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and I've been told I'm
done with what I was--

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Here to do.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is a new choice.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and I'm not sure
if my body is going to make

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
it through this experience.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So I was very aware that
I may physically die.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:90%
What's the choice?

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I went through all
kinds of what would people

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:90%
think about at this time.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of all
those survival things

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that people think of--
call 911, I want to live,

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
or I don't want to live,
those kind of things.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
no, I need to make

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:90%
a choice that is undivided.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.330 align:middle line:84%
That was the thing
I became aware

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.571 align:middle line:84%
of, is most choices we make
in our lives are divided,

00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:90%
either-or.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.469 align:middle line:84%
Meaning either-or,
or this or that.

00:27:46.469 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I want to do this, or
not that, or things like that.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And I needed to make a choice.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:90%
I was very clear about that.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:57.026 align:middle line:84%
I needed to find a choice that
I could make that was undivided.

00:27:57.026 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:90%
That is the real healing.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:90%
We're divided.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Healing means to restore
ourselves to wholeness.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So I need to make a
choice that will restore

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
the wholeness of myself.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I thought
of that, I realized

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I need to make a
choice to have life,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
but that choice isn't
about keeping the body

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.985 align:middle line:90%
or not keeping the body.

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:24.563 align:middle line:84%
It's not about making the
body completely healthy,

00:28:24.563 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:90%
or being crippled, or whatever.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I needed to be OK with any
condition life gave me.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Isn't it
interesting that we

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
walk around like
that, that we walk

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:90%
around divided so many times.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're in an unconscious job,
or an unconscious relationship,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and we are constantly
choosing to be in that place,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't really walk around
life choosing life all day long.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: No, it's always
either-or, for most people.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine if we did?

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll be walking
in eternal life.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
-On this earth?
-On this earth.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
While you have a body
or not, it doesn't

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:08.570 align:middle line:84%
matter, because you're having
and embracing life fully.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I can't quite
wrap my head around that.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I am still
attached to the body,

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
and the experience here.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have a child,
so I'd like to stay.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.013 align:middle line:84%
But see, then I am making
that choice, right?

00:29:18.013 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yup.
-OK.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: But
regardless of what happens,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like,
well, you experience--

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.791 align:middle line:84%
most everybody will experience
it when you love deeply.

00:29:28.791 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes.
-You love your child--

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.346 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Fully, completely.

00:29:31.346 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
---fully completely,
no questions.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And so no matter
what happens, you're

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be there for her.
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I choose that, yes.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.392 align:middle line:90%
That's-- it's not divided.

00:29:40.392 --> 00:29:41.092 align:middle line:90%
It's whole.

00:29:41.092 --> 00:29:43.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right,
right, I see the purity.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I needed to make that
decision about life in general.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
a particular person,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or just because I love this
person, but not that person.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to love life with
all its conditions.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So then
what happened?

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: When
I made that choice,

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.900 align:middle line:84%
something changed
inside of myself.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I came back into my body, and
my body was still struggling.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But now, again, I had all this
energy, so I could manage this.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I found that my
head was on the ground,

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and this green grass
was in front of my face,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
I'm staring at now.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Mother Earth.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: You're right here!

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I recognized, and I
said, Mother Earth.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, there is this heaviness
and something in my chest,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:90%
in my heart.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:90%
May I let this go into you?

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.565 align:middle line:84%
And this green became
this velvet blackness.

00:30:36.565 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It opened up like a curtain.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The green opened
up like a curtain

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:90%
into this velvet blackness.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that
happened, everything started

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:90%
pouring out of my chest.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It just kept pouring out.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It was like an oil change.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.565 align:middle line:90%
You know, this old--

00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:50.331 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's energy.

00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's old, gunky,
old, black energy came out.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And then there's faces.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I start to recognize
those faces and situations.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
These were residues.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I did quite well
healing myself after I

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
gave somebody else a
healing so I don't take

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:90%
on somebody else's illness.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's always little
bits of-- little residues

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:90%
here and there at times.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.814 align:middle line:84%
And over many years and
thousands of people.

00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Absolutely,
that's how--

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were quite desperate.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And so all this residue
that I accumulated came out,

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.517 align:middle line:84%
and out, and out,
and out, and out.

00:31:24.517 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
why many healers

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
wind up poisoning their body,
because they don't let that go.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah, that's
why I always joke that-- well,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not quite a joke,
but I joke that [CHUCKLE]

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:84%
healers are some of the sickest
people on the planet, because--

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.379 align:middle line:84%
-Because they take on.
-Exactly.

00:31:40.379 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we've known many that
have passed away because of.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.777 align:middle line:84%
So you poured this
into the earth.

00:31:45.777 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And
once that finished,

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
the green curtain of grass
came back into my view,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the blackness was gone,
and I felt lighter.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
And I felt I'm OK.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.981 align:middle line:84%
So then I jumped
up, ran upstairs--

00:31:57.981 --> 00:31:59.724 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What?
-[LAUGHS]

00:31:59.724 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Didn't
get an ambulance?

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobody called?
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh no, no.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I ran upstairs, and Raphaelle's
holding our dog and our cat,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're all just like,
oh my god, he's going to die.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
doing a lot better,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.912 align:middle line:84%
but I have this
appointment at ten o'clock.

00:32:15.912 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: What?

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:84%
This guy's coming all the
way from Israel to see me.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that interesting,
this man from Israel.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I did this whole thing.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So then I said, I feel
too weak to drive the two

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:90%
minutes into town office.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.386 align:middle line:90%
Raphaelle, could you take me?

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And she said, absolutely.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We get in the car-- she had
a separate plan, of course.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.292 align:middle line:84%
We get in the car,
we're starting to drive,

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.425 align:middle line:84%
and she said, how
are you feeling?

00:32:42.425 --> 00:32:44.645 align:middle line:90%
I says, I'm OK.

00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm much better, and thank you.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And and she said well, now
that you're feeling better,

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, I already changed
your appointment to later

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.500 align:middle line:84%
on this afternoon
indefinitely, and he

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
knows he's on call,
that you might

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:90%
not be able to see him today.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.275 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, thank you, and
so that gives us more time.

00:33:03.275 --> 00:33:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why don't we swing
by the hospital on the way?

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.867 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, it's on
the way to the office.

00:33:07.867 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
It's way on the
other side of town.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And so-- [LAUGHING]

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what Raphaelle
has to do, yeah.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And I was laughing inside.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh yeah.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.295 align:middle line:84%
And so not only to appease
her, but I thought,

00:33:20.295 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:90%
well, it would be good.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because now I got
the green light.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.237 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I wasn't
to go to the hospital.

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What do you mean
you got the green light?

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
green light to call

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
911, or go to emergency, or
see a doctor, or anything.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.016 align:middle line:84%
Because there was something
I had to do first.

00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:37.715 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, OK.

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was what the
whole choice thing was.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And now I look for guidance
and I get the green light--

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.715 align:middle line:90%
yes, you can go to the ER.

00:33:46.715 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So we go to the ER.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.680 align:middle line:10%
And so the lesson
that I'm hearing

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.000 align:middle line:10%
is that it is about
choosing life,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:10%
and is about making that
conscious choice every day.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.274 align:middle line:10%
So when you showed up,
though, at the ER with a--

00:33:59.274 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: I learned
that you shouldn't

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.430 align:middle line:10%
walk into the ER laughing.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Because
the triage nurse

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
couldn't tell who
was in trouble.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.639 align:middle line:10%
And she looked at Raphaelle.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:10%
She thought Raphaelle was the
one who needed the emergency.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:10%
And Raphaelle said no,
he's had chest pains,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:10%
and we're concerned
he's had a heart

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:10%
attack, and blah blah blah.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And the nurse looks at me,
and asked me a few questions.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:90%
She said, OK, well.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:84%
And she shouts back to the
back, another chest pain!

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh
you don't believe.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:84%
This morning, just in
the last 20 minutes,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
there's four people walking
in with chest pains,

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and they're all fine.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.880 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's like there's
like another order there.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.699 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So I go in-- the doctor
comes in, the ER doctor

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:90%
comes into the exam room.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking, and she
asks questions about the pain.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, that's much
better now than it was before.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And she says, how long before?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, what time-- and then I
realized I had no idea of time.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, what time is it?

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.045 align:middle line:90%
And she said 12:30.

00:34:58.045 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I said it started at
8:30 this morning.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And then she just had
this look of horror,

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.938 align:middle line:84%
and she started barking
out all these orders,

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.171 align:middle line:84%
and I'm strapped to
all these things.

00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:10.115 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So it was only three
hours later, and you were--

00:35:10.115 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, four hours later.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.453 align:middle line:84%
Three or four hours
later, and you were fine.

00:35:12.453 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And when she hooked me up to
the EKG, she got on the phone,

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
she's talking to somebody, some
doctor, cardiologist somewhere.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I called
for the ambulance.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take you to
a bigger city hosp-- this is

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.110 align:middle line:84%
a tiny town, so small
hospital can't handle

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:90%
the major condition I was in.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
you're about to die.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:39.335 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't inject
you with this deadly drug

00:35:39.335 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that could kill you-- has a
50% chance of killing you.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have to sign
this waiver for me

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to inject you with
this medication.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And I just blurted out laughing.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I says, I think I'm still alive.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing much better now.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And she said, look at that.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And she shows me
the EKG, and it's

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:90%
doing these amazing things.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And she said, that's
called a tombstone,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.595 align:middle line:84%
because it looks
like a tombstone.

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And It's called a tombstone
because everybody who has that

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:90%
dies.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.501 align:middle line:84%
And you're right in the middle
of this major heart attack.

00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:14.400 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you're having
a full conversation with her

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.285 align:middle line:90%
that you're more coherent.

00:36:15.285 --> 00:36:15.985 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Like you are now.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And so then I said,
well, and I said,

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.225 align:middle line:84%
well, gee, you're telling me
if I take this medication,

00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:90%
I have a 50% chance of dying?

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, you
have 100% chance of dying.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're the doctor.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Is that your best-- you know,
I'll go with your best opinion.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I only have one
opinion-- you better take this.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
So I signed.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I was aware
of that moment, everything

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.680 align:middle line:90%
was golden.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just I felt like I was
totally in the palms of God.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm being held up.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor wasn't aware,
anybody else in the room

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.440 align:middle line:90%
wasn't aware.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But I was aware that
everything was one.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:84%
What the doctor
wasn't aware of, she

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
was part of one
of the cast of all

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:90%
these people and the spirit.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing all these
spirit healers and angels,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing the doctor
and the physical people,

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:90%
and the medical people.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
working in unison.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
beautiful, divinely

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.755 align:middle line:84%
choreographed dance that's
happening right before my eyes.

00:37:28.755 --> 00:37:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm right in
the middle of this.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.991 align:middle line:84%
And everything is-- there's
nothing that can go wrong.

00:37:33.991 --> 00:37:35.424 align:middle line:84%
I knew that.
-So it didn't matter--

00:37:35.424 --> 00:37:36.523 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
It didn't matter.

00:37:36.523 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:84%
---in the energy and
the space you were in.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: It
wasn't that idea of I'd

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:90%
better make the right decision.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.341 align:middle line:84%
No-- I couldn't make
the wrong decision.

00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You were that guided and
protected in that space.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
space to be in.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, once again,
what I'm taking away

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
from this is you
don't have to die

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
in order to get that feeling.
MICHAEL TAMURA: No.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Just your explanation of it,
I can get a little glimpse

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:90%
into what you're talking about.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The gold is a very
clear description.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.085 align:middle line:84%
So after this experience you
went on to continue to teach,

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you went on to
continue to travel.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how long did it-- we
actually have a picture of you

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:90%
before a lecture.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.434 align:middle line:90%
How long after?

00:38:15.434 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
And the funny thing

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:10%
was it was on the way
to the next hospital

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:10%
that I actually died, that
technical part of, you know,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:10%
my heart stopping.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm in the back
of the ambulance,

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.915 align:middle line:10%
Raphaelle's driving her SUV.

00:38:27.915 --> 00:38:29.215 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh,
so they transported

00:38:29.215 --> 00:38:30.290 align:middle line:10%
you to another hospital?

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: To
another hospital,

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:10%
because they couldn't handle
this major of a heart trauma.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I got an hour and a half
ambulance ride to go through.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you
did get the injection?

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I did get the injection.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: I wonder if--

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And I felt better with that.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And then halfway through
the mountain pass,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this young
kid who's the paramedic.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
He was so intent.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I tried to calm him
down, and I said,

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.604 align:middle line:84%
don't worry, I'm not going
to croak on you. [CHUCKLE]

00:38:56.604 --> 00:38:57.931 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You said
this to this kid?

00:38:57.931 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's that moment
I said that, I was out,

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:90%
and I flat-lined.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going out the
body, and I'm going out

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:90%
the top of the ambulance roof.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I look back at Raphaelle
and she's like this

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:90%
on the steering wheel.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And she's clairvoyant.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, I
can imagine, yes.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
She sees me and
she goes, oh no.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And she does this.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:84%
She's fisting at me going
out of the body. [LAUGHS]

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.361 align:middle line:84%
And I'm laughing, because you're
in a very different space when

00:39:26.361 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:90%
you're out.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I told you this was an
unbelievable story, so OK.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:30.950 align:middle line:90%
So she's going like this.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this isn't
what she was thinking,

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.790 align:middle line:84%
but I, in my mind,
I just made up,

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
she's going I'm going to
kill you if you leave,

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.072 align:middle line:90%
if you die on me!

00:39:40.072 --> 00:39:41.105 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh my God. [CHUCKLE]

00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm kind of laughing.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:10%
And then the next thing, I'm in
the celestial realm surrounded

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:10%
by five golden beings.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And one comes down, turns
into this beautiful angel.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And she puts her
hand on my chest,

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:10%
and says, "not yet," and starts
pushing me back into the body.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I'm
really glad you're

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.284 align:middle line:90%
writing a book about this.

00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:00.850 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh,
there's a lot that went on.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's also
doing a movie about this.

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness,
because these-- it's

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:90%
like a comedy at this point.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But not really, because
the joy-- and the fact

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that, as I said earlier, that
he's sitting here telling

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:90%
this story is unbelievable.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.232 align:middle line:84%
So you were now
becoming familiar

00:40:16.232 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:84%
with the near-death experience.
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh yes.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.341 align:middle line:84%
You were out there again
looking at the ambulance.

00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And I have--

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: It's
different each time, yeah.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I've been through this, so I
can identify with what you're

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.250 align:middle line:84%
talking about, where
I had an accident,

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.840 align:middle line:90%
and went above, and looked down.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I do understand
what you're saying.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But you saw Raphaelle,
you had this conversation,

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
the angels said not now.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.155 align:middle line:84%
And what year was
this, by the way?

00:40:36.155 --> 00:40:39.510 align:middle line:90%
This was still 2006, July 11th.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: OK,
you remember that.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Two days before our
anniversary and three days

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:90%
before my birthday.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Birthday.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, you like
the birthday thing.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so after you went
to-- did the ambulance,

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.257 align:middle line:90%
the boy in the ambulance--

00:40:54.257 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah, well,
he had this paddles out.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think he had to
shock me to get me back.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I flat-lined and spontaneously--

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.730 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Came back.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And because the first thing
I heard him say was he was

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
telling his supervisor
in the front seat,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.425 align:middle line:84%
he's back, he's back! [LAUGHS]
He's sweating bullets.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Because he was going
to take his finals.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't even a fully
licensed paramedic yet.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.920 align:middle line:84%
He was a EMT, but he
was going for his finals

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.951 align:middle line:84%
for his paramedic
license the next week.

00:41:19.951 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, the guys probably
working in a market now,

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.355 align:middle line:84%
and let go of the
whole career, because--

00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:24.554 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
kind of the picture.

00:41:24.554 --> 00:41:25.816 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I'm
not doing this.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.613 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but he was very
happy that I came back.

00:41:28.613 --> 00:41:29.312 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:29.312 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And the rest was
uneventful, very nice.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the hospital,
the doctors, the cardiologists,

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
anesthesiologists, they
were ready to put me

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:90%
under to operate.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor looks at me
and says, how do you feel?

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, a lot better.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And he says, you look great!

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
He said your color's great,
your blood pressure is perfect,

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:90%
your pulse is perfect.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, your EKG shows you did
have a pretty bad heart attack,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's over now.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, you
mean now I don't

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
have to get surgery or
anything, or any kind

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.890 align:middle line:90%
of invasive procedures?

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:90%
And he said, not at this moment.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll put you up to cardiac
care unit, intensive care,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and watch you overnight.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.244 align:middle line:84%
And we'll make a decision
tomorrow what to do with you.

00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But he says, but you're not
getting out of the hospital.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:17.809 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:42:17.809 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, so you
stayed for a while.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And then how long after
that did you start to feel

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.620 align:middle line:90%
better, back on your feet?

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well, that night
I had another clot, basically

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:90%
almost like a pre-heart attack.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So they caught it, and
they put a stent in.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
not a major surgery,

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:90%
just a stent procedure.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Which was also amazing.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like, again, part
of that divine dance.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards-- it took like
five minutes, 10 minutes--

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and the anesthesiologist
and the cardiologist

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:84%
looked at each other,
says, that was fast.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
done this proced-- he said,

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I've done this
procedure 1,500 times.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It's never been this
perfect, and never

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.280 align:middle line:90%
been this fast, and this easy.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So your
experiences of truly going

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
through these near-deaths,
flat-lined-- I mean,

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.060 align:middle line:84%
this is, I think, the
third or fourth one

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:90%
that you've talked about now.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.616 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact that you're
not in a wheelchair right

00:43:18.616 --> 00:43:19.315 align:middle line:90%
now is amazing.

00:43:19.315 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're here talking,
fully energetic, bright,

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:90%
experiences talking about this.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And so is that why you went
back to teaching, because you--

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.950 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh yeah.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
what I'm here for.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And this gives me more
material. [LAUGHS] Nothing

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.013 align:middle line:90%
beats first-hand experience.

00:43:43.013 --> 00:43:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But I promised Raphaelle
and everybody else.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I said OK, I think I'm
done doing research.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, what
is the message?

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.670 align:middle line:84%
What are you teaching from
all of these experiences?

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well I've
learned from that experience

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.382 align:middle line:84%
to keep eternity in
front of me at all times.

00:44:00.382 --> 00:44:01.715 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And what
do you mean by that?

00:44:01.715 --> 00:44:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's easier said
than done, of course.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.550 align:middle line:84%
In regular life, in any
given day, how many times

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:middle line:84%
do you think about when, what
time something starts, when is

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.250 align:middle line:84%
it going to end, you
know, when are we going

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to get there, in
everyday life-- you know,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.050 align:middle line:90%
stuck in traffic, whatever.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:25.086 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking for
the beginning or the ending

00:44:25.086 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:84%
in time.
LISA GARR: Right, right.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Which doesn't really exist.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:84%
In spirit, there's
only eternity.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So there's only eternity.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Beginnings and
endings don't exist.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So I started to look at, to
live an unconditional life.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:84%
To embody that Christ
consciousness and energy,

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was incredibly
aware of every time

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a thought of when
is this going to end?

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, well, I realize we
do that when there's pain.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah, yes.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Whenever, any kind of pain,
we start to think about I

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.290 align:middle line:84%
don't know how long
this is going to last.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I want it to hurry up.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to get out of here.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.560 align:middle line:90%
I want to finish.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Grow to the next
moment, the next moment, yes.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want the
good stuff to start.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Instant, yes.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.750 align:middle line:84%
This Christ consciousness
that you're talking about,

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.590 align:middle line:90%
can you explain what that is?

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.720 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I've been

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.640 align:middle line:90%
experiencing more and more.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the totality and
the unity of life.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.840 align:middle line:90%
We're not separate.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.590 align:middle line:84%
When I died the fourth
time, it was a real--

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:90%
that was the biggest one.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I was exercising at the
gym, and my heart stopped.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:44.431 align:middle line:84%
This was August, August
10th of 2011, last year.

00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And that
that was a doozy.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is every
experience, both any kind

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
of past life recall of my
death, and of a lifetime,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.280 align:middle line:84%
or these experiences,
the near-death

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:84%
experiences I've had in this
life, everything is unique.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Every experience is different,
details, different experience.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that kept
on coming back around

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.810 align:middle line:84%
from this fourth one, I
realize the first one was-- I

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:90%
said it was kind of a rebirth.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:20.470 align:middle line:84%
The second one was kind
of checking in and setting

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:90%
course for my new life.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it took about two years
to get into my new life.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.675 align:middle line:84%
And then this third one--
or the fourth experience,

00:46:29.675 --> 00:46:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the third death,
was one of total.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I have no recollection
of what happened

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:90%
here in the physical world.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
I was at the gym.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.635 align:middle line:84%
In fact I don't
remember 15 days worth--

00:46:45.635 --> 00:46:46.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, OK

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.300 align:middle line:84%
---of anything And so
from whatever happened

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:84%
on the physical side was all
hearsay from medical people,

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and people who were witnesses.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I was exercising.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in a very good
shape from really

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
working myself back to health
from the other experiences.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And my heart was in good
condition and everything.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.750 align:middle line:90%
But it just stopped.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And I flopped.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And somebody ran downstairs
to tell the manager.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Just so happens that the
manager's son, 19-year-old son,

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
was a fully-trained
EMT working out.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.610 align:middle line:84%
He was back from college
just for the weekend,

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.820 align:middle line:84%
waiting for his mom to go
out to lunch or something

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.640 align:middle line:84%
after her shift ended, which
was in about half an hour.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So this all happens, and
they had some trouble getting

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.970 align:middle line:90%
everything to the right spot.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when he was the first
responder, when he found me,

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.965 align:middle line:84%
he said I was already in
kind of a rigor mortis,

00:47:43.965 --> 00:47:46.850 align:middle line:84%
he said, this premature
kind of a rigor

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
mortis where I was completely
stiff, all gnarled up.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.230 align:middle line:84%
My legs were tangled up
in the elliptical machine,

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.310 align:middle line:84%
so he couldn't get
me out of there.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.210 align:middle line:84%
He said I had no pulse, no
respiration, no nothing.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And so he had to get help.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Four people had to untangle
me from the elliptical machine

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:08.534 align:middle line:84%
to put me flat on the ground
so then he can start--

00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:09.600 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Actually helping you.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.180 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
a picture of him--

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah!

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: --and his mom.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were
working at the gym.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So from this experience
where you were--

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and you had the memory loss
and everything like that,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:84%
what did you take away
from that experience?

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.310 align:middle line:84%
At that point, did you
realize that you needed

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to get your heart checked, that
you needed another procedure,

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.460 align:middle line:90%
or did it even--

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Oh, I
had a open-heart surgery.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.151 align:middle line:84%
But not because
of what happened.

00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:38.690 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLE]
LISA GARR: OK.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.510 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: When they were
checking me to see-- because

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of my previous heart
attacks and stuff,

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.930 align:middle line:84%
they thought that
was another one.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't a heart attack.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They went in to check,
and the cardiologist found

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.614 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't the problem.

00:48:52.614 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: No
blockage [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And then but while he was in
there, something else burst.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Another artery in
my heart burst open.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So if that had happened
somewhere else,

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I would have been dead and gone.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.510 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So all this is happening
in the physical world.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
what I experienced

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:15.220 align:middle line:84%
was the most incredible--
it was like being-- before,

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.840 align:middle line:90%
all the other ones, is leaving.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.010 align:middle line:90%
This one was being sucked out.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.325 align:middle line:90%
It was like a express--

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: A vacuum, hm.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Like somebody came
and picked me up.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, I was
transported to the feeling of it

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:84%
now, as far away from here
as you can possibly get to,

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:84%
yet being in the total
center of it all.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the feeling of it.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And what did you gather there?

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: What I would
estimate about three days earth

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:51.080 align:middle line:84%
time, I was sitting
in front of what

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I can call the eternal
flame of God's love.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.960 align:middle line:84%
That was the word that I came
up with from the experience,

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.860 align:middle line:90%
which doesn't do it justice.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's this central,
most sacred place.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling there
is, there's no me.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't exist.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.842 align:middle line:90%
But I'm aware of it.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.075 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: You're
pure consciousness.

00:50:13.075 --> 00:50:14.800 align:middle line:10%
It's just all awareness.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.270 align:middle line:10%
There's no end in sight.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:24.270 align:middle line:10%
It's just this incredible
space of holiness and love,

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:10%
unconditional.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's interesting
because in that space,

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we actually
have physical words.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.480 align:middle line:90%
They haven't been created.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.180 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't exist in time.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk,
we have to put one

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:90%
word after another-- linear.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.490 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing linear there.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just--
once I'm back here,

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.870 align:middle line:84%
being able to talk
in linear time,

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I could describe it
the best I could.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But it has nothing really to
do with the actual experience.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that
that's the ultimate feeling

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.990 align:middle line:90%
of what the afterlife is?

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:02.290 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: This place
was not a typical place

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that a soul goes to when he or
she dies from an incarnation.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.110 align:middle line:84%
This is where-- I
was very humbled,

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and very-- I don't know
what-- again, there's

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:17.090 align:middle line:90%
no words to describe it.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But I got this tremendous
blessing and initiation

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of being able to be in the
sanctuary for a period of time,

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.970 align:middle line:90%
to immerse in this energy.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I was taken
to various temples of learning

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in a whole different arena
of the celestial spheres,

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.850 align:middle line:84%
if you will, where I
was put through a lot

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:42.900 align:middle line:84%
of rigorous, advanced
spiritual training,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.290 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
here meditation,

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:90%
very deep meditation.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But their example, one was being
in this-- like a cylindrical,

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.590 align:middle line:90%
a small cylindrical space.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
all the walls are gone,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and the floor's gone.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything's gone, I'm
floating in mid-space.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And the most horrific
things start to come at you.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from every direction,
every kind of vile,

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:84%
evil, what people would
call evilness, and darkness,

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and horror, and terror, and
everything comes at you.

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And I was prepared.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, go
into meditation,

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and whatever happens from this
point, once this thing starts,

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:27.570 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens you have
to be totally centered

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and letting everything
pass through.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:90%
You can't resist anything.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I practice.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Without the body, it's
a little bit easier.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's still-

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:38.456 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right,
I can understand.

00:52:38.456 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The mind reacts
to things, right?

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Mm, still, yes.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I have to be totally
still and let this happen.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would go on,
and on, and on, and on.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
ultimate ego-less space.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.704 align:middle line:84%
That was the absence
of ego at all.

00:52:51.704 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: In
practicing that.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a test, so to speak.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I'd
be taken to other spaces

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to work things out, and then
come back to that space.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So have you been
able to access that state

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in meditation?

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.800 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And in daily life.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aware this process
was more like resurrection

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.860 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to rebirth.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.560 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Rebirth, you get a clear
slate, and you start over fresh.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.540 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I just can't believe
the stories, the experiences.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.182 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that this is going
to be put into a book soon,

00:53:28.182 --> 00:53:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, shown to
people throughout a movie.

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:34.305 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you want
to, like, tell the audience--

00:53:34.305 --> 00:53:35.590 align:middle line:84%
we just have a
few minutes left--

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
of what we can
hope to experience,

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.060 align:middle line:84%
or bring into this
consciousness now?

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Not that we have to
go outside to do that.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
The single most important thing
from all the death experiences

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of death,
including divorces, and moving,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and losing a job, and
losing a person you love,

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and the whole bit, is every
death, the lesson is the same.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Every death is to be able to
let go of a little bit more

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of our selfishness,
our possessiveness,

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:12.050 align:middle line:84%
which come from
dividing ourselves,

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.390 align:middle line:90%
come from wanting to separate.

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we
stub our toe, we want

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.190 align:middle line:90%
to separate from that pain.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.995 align:middle line:84%
When something
happens in our lives,

00:54:18.995 --> 00:54:21.220 align:middle line:90%
we want to separate from it.

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of that desire to
separate and becoming whole,

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.250 align:middle line:90%
it's letting go of selfishness.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.250 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So letting go, and
letting go, and letting go.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.184 align:middle line:84%
And this is a practice
that we could do?

00:54:32.184 --> 00:54:33.050 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Every day.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:34.315 align:middle line:84%
Every day, it's
simple, it's not

00:54:34.315 --> 00:54:37.240 align:middle line:84%
a five-step process or an
entire-- it's just letting go.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And how do we detach like that?

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we still do
have the ego involved.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.250 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes, so it's
recognizing-- letting go, also

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.110 align:middle line:84%
another way of saying
it is forgiving

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And in Japanese, the word
for forgiveness is yurushi.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:84%
To forgive means yurushi, which
is the same as untying a knot,

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.009 align:middle line:84%
or loosening up a knot
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:54:58.009 --> 00:55:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and forgiving,
to me, is exactly that.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.380 align:middle line:84%
We're loosening up the knot
we're binding ourselves to,

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and letting go of the clinging.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:12.580 align:middle line:84%
In the Afghani language, I heard
the term for death is clinging,

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.380 align:middle line:90%
to cling.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So you die if you cling.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.880 align:middle line:84%
If you let go,
you'll live forever.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So if you're too
attached, too obsessive,

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.970 align:middle line:84%
it's a slow death.
It's like--

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah,
it's holding on is death,

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and letting go is life.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
forgiving is when you realize

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the truth, what the
truth really is, it's

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.690 align:middle line:90%
like waking up from a dream.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The dream, you think it's real,
right, when you're dreaming?

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this
is really intense,

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm running away from
the bad guys or whatever,

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and scared, and all that.

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:84%
You wake up, and you go,
oh, that was just a dream.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.020 align:middle line:90%
That was a bad nightmare.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's forgiving, is
when you recognize the thing

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that you thought
was so horrible, so

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.880 align:middle line:84%
terrible in your
life, or so painful,

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.140 align:middle line:90%
it's really just a dream.

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just the images
that we keep in our mind

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:08.375 align:middle line:84%
and project it into the
world as if it's real.

00:56:08.375 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I just
would love to have

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.520 align:middle line:90%
a whole other hour with you.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.181 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we
could continue on.

00:56:13.181 --> 00:56:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Because--
MICHAEL TAMURA: Easily.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:18.000 align:middle line:84%
---in this hour, you've given
me the experience of what

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.150 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife is like, what
pure consciousness is like,

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:26.020 align:middle line:84%
what the experience of
detachment really is,

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhist philosophy
of detachment.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It really is-- neutrality,
maybe detachment

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.295 align:middle line:90%
isn't even the right word.

00:56:33.295 --> 00:56:36.670 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah, because
people think of neutrality

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.224 align:middle line:90%
or detachment as flat.

00:56:38.224 --> 00:56:39.455 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah, right.
-No feeling.

00:56:39.455 --> 00:56:41.350 align:middle line:84%
-No emotion.
-And that's not true.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:45.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no emotion, but
in the absence of emotion,

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:50.530 align:middle line:84%
there's what we would call
joy and profound peace.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:52.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's embodying
the Christ, as you call it.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of
your religious belief,

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.290 align:middle line:84%
it's embodying that
feeling of oneness.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.490 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: All-inclusive.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.810 align:middle line:90%
All-inclusive.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And you live your
life like that now?

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, I practice.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:06.180 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, and then
look at how many times

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.030 align:middle line:84%
you've brought joy
into this hour as well.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've brought laughter
and joy about serious topics.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And you could be sitting here
in a wheelchair, and you're not.

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You're here vibrant, alive,
colorful, and laughter,

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.160 align:middle line:90%
is about it.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thank you
so much for bringing

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.780 align:middle line:84%
this incredible experience and
all of your experiences with us

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to bring us the teaching
moments from it I really

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.310 align:middle line:90%
do believe that you have.

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And Michael Tamura's book is
called "You Are the Answer."

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:10%
You can take a look at
that on this website,

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.750 align:middle line:10%
which is michaeltamura.com.

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.320 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot more there that
you can learn from his stories

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and his experiences.

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:46.835 align:middle line:10%
And I just thank you for
being here, I really do.

00:57:46.835 --> 00:57:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Please come back.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.594 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:51.745 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Or--
-Promise--

00:57:51.745 --> 00:57:52.813 align:middle line:90%
Stay, stay. [LAUGHS]

00:57:52.813 --> 00:57:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Stay, we have this
on video-- stay.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.220 align:middle line:84%
In obedience school,
I learned "heel" first.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to learn
"stay." [LAUGHS]

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:04.100 align:middle line:84%
