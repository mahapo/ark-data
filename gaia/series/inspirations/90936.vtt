>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So what does a CEO and a senior
executive for the past 30 years

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
know about creating success
through rituals, specifically?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, a lot.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.275 align:middle line:84%
Chris Attwood is
my guest, and he

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:84%
is the co-author of the New York
Times bestseller, "The Passion

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Test" along with Janet
Attwood, and he's also

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:84%
an expert in the field
of human consciousness

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and also deeply grounded in the
practical world of business.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
His latest book is called
"Your Hidden Riches:

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Unleashing the Power
of Ritual to Create

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
a Life of Meaning and Purpose."

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.185 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS ATTWOOD:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So ritual, what
exactly do you mean by ritual?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.175 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Hmm.

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
People have all sorts
of ideas about rituals.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
talk about rituals,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about
religious practices,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.625 align:middle line:84%
although there are
beautiful rituals

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
in all religious traditions
around the world.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
We're also not talking
about superstition.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are also not
so beautiful ones, right?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: There are.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's voodoo
and things like that.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.363 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: There are
those sort of things.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Biker gangs who use
rituals as well.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up the point,
rituals really are tools.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
They can be used for
good or bad purposes.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.154 align:middle line:84%
But I remember we talked with
one of the leading researchers

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
on ritual, Dr. Andrew Newberg,
as we were writing the book

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and what he said is
that rituals are amoral.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So rituals in and
of themselves aren't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
for one purpose or another.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.987 align:middle line:90%
Just like a hammer.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You can use a hammer
to build a house,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%
or you can use it to tear down.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we specifically
use rituals

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
to say that rituals are
conscious intentional practices

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
used to improve
your life, and you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
make them habitual because
they do improve your life.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does the
physical act of a ritual

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
help you actually manifest
something a little bit stronger

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
than just the intention process?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: It's
a great question.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The truth is what
helps us manifest

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
anything is the power of
our awareness, our ability

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the deepest
part of our own nature,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and then bring that
manifestation from that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:90%
place out into the world.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So intention can
be very powerful

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
when the individual is connected
to that part of themselves,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to that deep,
inner part, what we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
call your spiritual
core, transcendent core.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But rituals are
really a mechanism

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to be able to connect with that.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.068 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're not
talking necessarily

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
about lighting a candle and
sitting in a meditation ritual

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.083 align:middle line:90%
type of thing.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
everyday, super practical.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
You're re-framing the idea
of ritual in this book,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.313 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, we're
talking about both frankly.

00:02:40.313 --> 00:02:42.616 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk about everyday
rituals, which are easy,

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
simple things you can
incorporate in your day

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
as conscious,
intentional practices,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and we also talk about
ceremonial rituals, which

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
are more involved,
which may involve

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.271 align:middle line:84%
lighting candles and
music and incense

00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.436 align:middle line:84%
But they actually serve
two very distinct purposes.

00:02:57.436 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So could a ritual--

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's rituals
in religious situations.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
There's rituals in tribal
situations and so forth,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
culturally, but
could a ritual be--

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference between
a ritual and a habit, something

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.354 align:middle line:84%
that you do every single
day to create an outcome.

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We all have good and bad habits,
but most of the time, these

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
are things that
develop unconsciously,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're just mental
and emotional patterns

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, rituals
are conscious.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:90%
They're intentional.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
They're something that you
choose to make habitual

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to make
your life better in some way,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and I'll give you an example.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a World
Cup Soccer player

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.901 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Leighton Baines.

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%
He plays for the British team.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Every time he comes
on the playing field

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll see him kneel
down, untie his shoes,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:90%
and then tie his shoes again.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't really
say that's a good habit.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.422 align:middle line:84%
You can't really say
that's a bad habit.

00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not a habit.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a ritual.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amoral.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.576 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: It's amoral

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:90%
But it has a purpose for him.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Actually in that
context he's using it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
for a purpose that
serves him, which

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
is to get him into a mental
and emotional state where he's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.055 align:middle line:84%
ready to perform at his
best and to stay focused,

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
even when there are
thousands of fans screaming

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in the stands,
millions of people

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:90%
watching him on television.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That ritual separates his
everyday daily activities,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
his ordinary life, from his
life on the playing field,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
and by performing that ritual,
it helps him make a transition.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I was recently talking
with Jack Canfield, who

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
you know very well as well,
and he was sharing his rituals

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
before he gets on stage
to do presentations.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing, same
thing as Leighton Baines.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
He has specific rituals
that he goes through

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
before he speaks to
get him in that state

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
where he's ready to be
of greatest service.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:90%
That's his intention.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Let me be of service.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me be able to help
and support these people

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:90%
in the best way that I'm able.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And so he has a whole
visualization exercise

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.856 align:middle line:84%
that he goes through,
and he creates

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:90%
an expression of gratitude.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
He says an expression
of gratitude

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
before he goes on, asking that
he be used in the situation

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be
really of service.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's a
good example of ritual.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So back to the soccer
player for a second.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that that
soccer player won the game

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:84%
when he did that
on his shoes once--

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.139 align:middle line:84%
and I mean-- so he creates
that intention again?

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Now it may be.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, specifically, the
history of how it came to be,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
but it could be that he had
a good experience with it.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The person that
wears the same shirt,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:90%
This is my lucky shirt.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This is my lucky--
we used to have what?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.849 align:middle line:90%
The rabbit's foot.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Rabbit's foot, yeah.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.145 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
I love this one.

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:90%
You know actor Colin Farrell?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And every time he
starts a new movie,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.707 align:middle line:90%
he wears the same boxer shorts.

00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, he does?

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.206 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They have shamrocks on them, and
they say the luck of the Irish.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good other example
of why we use rituals,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
because what he's doing is he
was-- he's reminding himself,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm Irish.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm lucky.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Things are going
to come into place.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do a great movie.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
re-enforcement for what

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
he intends to experience
when he's doing that movie,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's really one of the
powers that ritual has-- is

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:84%
it allows us to be
able to get in a space

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
where we can create what we
choose to have in our life.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How can you use it
to really improve your life?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.194 align:middle line:84%
In what situation would it
work with to improve your life?

00:06:16.194 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So the ritual has many
purposes from many different

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
perspectives, and of course,
improve is a relative term.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But what you'll see is in
every industry people who

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
are really, really
successful have all

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
incorporated the
rituals into their life

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you see
that sports players

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
use rituals to improve
their performance,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get their mind
into the game as it were.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
The musicians and
artists use rituals

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to spark their
creativity so that they

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
can be the best at
what their passion is.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Business leaders use rituals
to create cohesive teams

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and to create strong
corporate cultures.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Celebrities use
rituals to create

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
balance between their personal
lives and their work lives.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And for me, all of those
are improving your life.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'd love to hear some
ideas around those rituals,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
because it is
fascinating, but first

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look
at the slide here.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind
of shows us what

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
ritual-- what your
idea of rituals are

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:90%
and why we should perform them.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.949 align:middle line:84%
So one is rituals give
more meaning to life,

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's what it says
there on the slide.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: So can
we talk about that?

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, please.

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Because
rituals make things real.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the rituals, the
traditional rituals in cultures

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
all around the world and you
can look right here at home,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.769 align:middle line:84%
because we've all
experienced a wedding, right?

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, right.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And what
does a wedding do?

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:84%
A wedding takes
something abstract, which

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is this commitment that
two people are making,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and it makes it concrete,
it makes it real.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We bring all of our friends
and our family together,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and we have all the pomp
and the circumstance

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and music and poetry, and
all these amazing things

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:90%
to create--

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the vows.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Vows-- memorable
experience, right?

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And it makes that real.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It makes this thing that was
abstract something that's

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
more concrete.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We can see it, feel
it, experience it.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great things
about a wedding ritual,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds of
ceremonial rituals,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is that they help to
connect us with that deeper

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:90%
part of ourselves.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why you probably--
maybe you've experienced this,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.657 align:middle line:84%
but we've all seen
or been the one who's

00:08:24.657 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:90%
been crying at a wedding, right?

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.698 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:08:26.698 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And why
does that happen?

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It's because through
that ceremony,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
through this coming together
and all the elements that

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
have been put
together, we connect

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
with that part of ourselves
which says this is beautiful,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
and we connect with that
idea that two people could

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
love each other enough to
be able to make a commitment

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.352 align:middle line:84%
to spend a whole life
together, and that touches us.

00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
very powerful one,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
because it does energetically
seem to change a relationship,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
when someone-- when a couple
actually cements their vows

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and witnesses are
about, and it gets

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:90%
put on paper through contract.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.824 align:middle line:84%
It does change the
energy of a relationship.

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: It makes it real.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.753 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: It makes it concrete.

00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It makes it something more than
just a passing fancy, right?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, could you
create that without the ritual,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
just live together and
act as if you're married?

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You probably couldn't create
the same thing, could you?

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
it's interesting.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
People can live together
without a marriage ceremony

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and certainly be
committed to each other.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But will they have the same
experience, the same sense

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
that we shared together

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.377 align:middle line:90%
in that same way.

00:09:40.377 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I kind of asked
the question in wonderment

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
if it would or not.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, some people think no.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
ceremony to be in love.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time, the society

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
looks at a couple who
has had that ceremony as

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.782 align:middle line:90%
officially married.

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
and you're going

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
to find all kinds of answers.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course, of course.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.186 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Everybody's going
to feel one way or the other,

00:10:01.186 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and-- and I know for me,
having been fortunate enough

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to marry a beautiful woman
who's the mother of my children,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.795 align:middle line:84%
that the ceremony ev-- and ours
was a very simple ceremony,

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:84%
you know-- I don't know if
you know the story, Lisa,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but we woke up one
morning and decided

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.035 align:middle line:90%
to get married that day.

00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:20.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh!

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And we gathered
a couple of friends

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.684 align:middle line:84%
and went off to Muir Woods in
the San Francisco Bay area.

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh nice!

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And we created
this amazing little ritual

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and ceremony, and
it was very special.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.049 align:middle line:84%
It created a different
character to our relationship--

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But that added meaning.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And I wouldn't want
to be without it, personally.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
All right, so back to the idea
of why performing rituals.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It also-- The rituals help
calm us and create more balance

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me an example
of a ritual that does that?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Sure.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So what we say in
"Your Hidden Riches"

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
is that rituals help you
manage your time, your energy,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and your thinking, and all
of us need that, right?

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the rituals are a way
of bringing ourselves back

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
to ourself.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And it could be by
establishing a routine

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in our life, a daily
set of rituals,

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we have time for
exercise, for stretching,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for breathing, for
meditation, or prayer.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so
those are rituals?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Those
are all rituals.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.114 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
come into our day,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
having had that sequence of
actively engaging our body,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and then quieting our
mind and our body as well,

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
when we come into our
activity, then we're

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
more calm-- when things
go more smoothly-- that we

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:90%
don't feel as upset.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Then there are
specific rituals that

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.841 align:middle line:84%
can be done for the
purpose of calming.

00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we teach in the book

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.572 align:middle line:84%
is called alternate
nostril breathing.

00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Just-- You're just breathing,
breathing out and in

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
from one nostril and
then reversing it.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's calming.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And that
simple ritual-- doing it

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for five minutes, 10
minutes-- if you're

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in a situation where you feel
a lot of stress, anxiousness,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
worry, tension, you can
do it for a few minutes,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and you'll feel your
whole system settle down.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You become relaxed, at
ease, and so then you

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
can go on and really
perform your best.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that
also could help you

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.635 align:middle line:84%
focus, which is another
reason of why doing rituals

00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is because it'd help
you really focus,

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:90%
which we need these days.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.316 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Absolutely.

00:12:28.316 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I use Leighton Baines
as the example-- the tying

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and untying his shoes.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing
there-- and he says

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
this-- I mean he doesn't
quite say it in the same way

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I do; he says something
about it helps

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:90%
me get my head on straight.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But what he means is
that it's helping get him

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
into a mental and emotional
state where he's ready

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and in that state to
both perform at his best

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
and also to really focus.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one I love,
Serena Williams, tennis player.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Every time before
she serves, she

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.644 align:middle line:84%
bounces the ball
exactly five times.

00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:02.435 align:middle line:90%
Now why five times?

00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:03.286 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh really?

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I never noticed that.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.546 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Five times.

00:13:05.546 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because by counting
the number of bounces,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.487 align:middle line:90%
where is her attention?

00:13:10.487 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On the ball.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Exactly.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.341 align:middle line:84%
So she's not worried about
what anyone in the stand

00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is going to think.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.631 align:middle line:84%
She's not worried
about whether she's

00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
going to perform well or not.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:90%
She's focused and present.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when she-- And then
because she's practiced

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
so much, she now can go
into the automatic motion

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.687 align:middle line:90%
of making her serve.

00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you find all
of these different rituals?

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Did you just look
and they're there?

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: That's what
happens when you write a book.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:33.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:34.805 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: You
research; you look.

00:13:34.805 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything's around you.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.376 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:13:36.376 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It's all here.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing, Lisa, was
that when we wrote this book,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
really the reason we wrote
it is because, for years,

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
more than a decade now, we've
been helping people discover

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
their passions and
connect with their purpose

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
through the Passion Test.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
People find their
top five passions,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and then they ask us
consistently, OK, now

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:90%
how do I make my passions real?

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do I get
them into my life?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah, how
do I make a living?

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
How do I meet my
responsibilities?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:84%
How do I follow my
passions and still do

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
everything I'm
committed to doing?

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And remember I said
rituals make things real.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And what Janet and
I realized is that,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
when we looked at our
own lives, the thing

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that had made such a
difference because both of us

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
have been doing rituals since
we were teenagers really--

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and that it's those
rituals are what

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
have allowed us, not only
to be ready for success

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:84%
as it came, but also when things
showed up that weren't quite

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
what we wanted them to be,
to be able to really recover

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
more quickly and come
back to ourselves so we

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.779 align:middle line:90%
could take the next step.

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's a ritual
for when things go wrong,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:90%
when chaos ensues?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
What is a ritual for that?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, so really
it's coming back to yourself.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the book we call
it the expansion process.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what we generally
call nature's guidance system.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Nature is-- or life
is always giving us

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
clues about what
direction to take.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we're upset,
when we just feel like--

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMS]

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Things are going crazy, and
nothing's working, then that's

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
what we call contraction.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We shut down, and we
naturally want to go inward.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're
supposed to do at that time.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And the problem comes when
we try and push through.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
We say, OK, I've got
to make it happen.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it anyway.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then things really
fall apart at that point.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
When we relax into
it, and that's we

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%
call the expansion process.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
We relax into it,
allow ourselves

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to feel what it
is we're feeling,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because that's really the first
step to allowing that to heal.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes
we'll notice there's

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
a physical sensation
in our body.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We let our attention,
our awareness,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:90%
go to that physical sensation.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we feel like
crying, we cry.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
If we are angry, we scream
into a pillow or-- we

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
don't take it out someone
else, but whatever

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
we need to be able to
feel what we're feeling.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we use the
tools, and that's rituals.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
We use those things that we know
will allow us to expand again.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.945 align:middle line:90%
And that could be meditation.

00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:03.695 align:middle line:90%

It could be-- there are
many different things.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that we've
been recommending to people

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
for years that I love is create
an emergency use worksheet.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:90%

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.279 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: That's right.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.336 align:middle line:90%

00:16:20.336 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's funny.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.251 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Think about
when you were last really,

00:16:23.251 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:90%
really, really upset.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine that?

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.599 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And when you're
in the midst of that upset,

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
are you likely to remember the
things that will help you feel

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
better or--

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: So the
emergency worksheet

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
is for those times when
you're really upset,

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.061 align:middle line:84%
and you felt the
feelings, but you just

00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
remember, oh, I
should look at this.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.976 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, I could
do that, and I'll

00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
feel better because you're
not likely to think of it when

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:90%
you're all upset.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.874 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Once I took a picture
of my vision board,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.892 align:middle line:84%
and I made it the
screensaver on my phone,

00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
so every time I
would look at that,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
it would reinforce
what my goals were.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.512 align:middle line:84%
And subconsciously,
every time I would

00:17:03.512 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
put that, it would
reinforce those goals.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I finally got rid
of the screensaver

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
because I had accomplished
all of those goals.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: [LAUGHING]
There you go.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.336 align:middle line:84%
Now you need to
have the next set.

00:17:12.336 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I have
to do that over again.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
and that's what we

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
tell people to do
with their passions.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Identify your top five passions,
then put them on your phone,

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.238 align:middle line:90%
put them on your computer.

00:17:21.238 --> 00:17:23.154 align:middle line:84%
Write them out, put them
on your refrigerator.

00:17:23.154 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good idea.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Put them
in your bathroom

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.375 align:middle line:84%
because the key to
living your passions

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
is whenever you're faced
with a choice, a decision,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
or an opportunity, choose
in favor of those passions.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do
that is ritualizing

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
the act of making decisions
by having those passions where

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:90%
you can see them.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now let's
talk about having rituals

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
make you healthy-- so
getting rid of addictions--

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
so let's take smoking
as an example.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
What type of ritual can
you use, because smoking

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.242 align:middle line:90%
itself is a ritual, right?

00:17:53.242 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
it's an addiction.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's an addiction.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.463 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's the difference?

00:17:56.463 --> 00:17:58.349 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: You could
say it's a ritual,

00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
but it's a ritual that
doesn't improve your life,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
so it's not a ritual that
meets our definition.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
People use the word
ritual for things

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that are both negative
in their consequences

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and positive in
their consequences.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
We've chosen in the book
to define it narrowly

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
as practices that
improve your life.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.202 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
good distinction.

00:18:17.202 --> 00:18:17.702 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: When it comes
to smoking-- addictions

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
of any kind-- are simply
patterns that we've created.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They're maybe deep
patterns, and when

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
it comes to drugs or cigarettes
or alcohol, those sorts

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.526 align:middle line:84%
of things, they're more
than just mental patterns

00:18:34.526 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:84%
or emotional patterns;
they're actually

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
physical patterns that have
been created in our body,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
so we have to change
those patterns.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And the way we
change those patterns

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
is by installing a
new set of patterns,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
a new set of activities,
which we can call rituals.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Alcoholics Anonymous,
or AA, is a complete set

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of rituals for
overcoming addiction.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you go through,
it's a 12-step program,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and the whole process
is ritualized.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is is
because these people need

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to create a new set of
patterns, and so by installing

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
these healthy patterns,
constructive patterns, then

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
it allows them to break
the old patterns which

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
were established
through the addiction.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's basically
a 12-step ritual?

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to undo
an old pattern--

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.565 align:middle line:84%
so creating a new pattern
to undo an old pattern.

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: See,
this is what's so

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
wonderful is that you
wanna change a pattern,

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to go
and analyze the problem.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go and
figure out, oh, what did I do

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and what a terrible
person I was.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And how do I have to
change every little way I

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
speak or think or
do or anything.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
analyze the problem.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.945 align:middle line:84%
It's simple as, if you want
to-- if you go into a dark room

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make it light,
just turn on the light switch.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, you want
to change a pattern that

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.262 align:middle line:84%
isn't useful, you
install a new pattern

00:19:58.262 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that you know is
constructive and useful,

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and we call that a ritual.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
also a good way

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to put reminders
back into your life.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of
the rituals that you

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
do to-- that you create
on a daily basis,

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and how did you stumble
upon all of this?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, my whole
introduction to ritual

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
came through meditation
because many, many years ago I

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:84%
was hired as planning
director for a small community

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
near Santa Barbara
called Isla Vista.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And this was after three riots.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
This was in the Vietnam War era,
and there had been blow ups,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and the Bank of
America had been burned

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
to the ground in Isla Vista.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And there
had been this big upset.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the county and the
state came in and said,

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
we better put some
funding in this community

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
because things
aren't going so well

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
the way they are right now.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And so a self-appointed
governing entity was created,

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
which was elected by all the
people in this community,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and then they used this budget
to hire a planning director.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:90%
In this case, it was me.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So I had a budget which
in today's dollars

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
would be a couple
million dollars.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I was 20 years old.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: I had no
clue what I was doing,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was a little overwhelmed
to be honest with you.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
My stomach was
upset all the time.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I had serious indigestion.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:90%
My skin was flaking off my face.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was in bad shape.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.519 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know which
direction to take first.

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's a
big job for a 20 year old.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: It was.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It was a big job.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
came up and said,

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Chris, you should try meditation
because it's a great way

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate stress, and
transcendental meditation

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
was the meditation
he recommended.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, sure,
I'll check it out,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the
lectures, and I started.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And from the very first
moment I sat down,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that something
serious had shifted.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing
something different

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
than I had before--
which was great-- that

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
was enough to keep me
meditating for the next week.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But then my
indigestion went away,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and my skin stopped flaking.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And I had clarity
like I had never had before,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I really
knew the direction to take,

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, hmm,
this is pretty cool.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that kept me meditating
regularly for the next year.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end of that year,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we had to get funding again
from the state and the county

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
government, and so I was
preparing this proposal,

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and I went through, and
I got through three pages

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of the things we
accomplished in that year.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.654 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Virtually
all of them things

00:22:26.654 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that I had initiated in my
role, and I went, oh my god, I

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:84%
could never have
done this if I hadn't

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
had this regular
practice in my life.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I was doing
it every morning,

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes in the morning,
20 minutes in the afternoon.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
We had this big, huge
office, and there

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.831 align:middle line:84%
were a number of
people working there,

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't really sit
and meditate very well,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
so I'd go in the bathroom.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING]

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.824 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And
sit for 20 minutes

00:22:48.824 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and do my ritual meditation.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was your experience
of your official ritual,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.899 align:middle line:84%
but now, that was
how many years ago?

00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: That was
more than 40 years ago,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and I still use that ritual.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
great statement

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of how do you create
rituals for yourself that

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:90%
really are valuable?

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Now this was one that I was
taught-- extremely valuable,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
extremely beneficial-- but
it had some key elements

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:90%
that any ritual needs to have.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
One, it was simple to do.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:90%
It was easy and effortless.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take a lot of
time, relatively speaking,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and as a result of seeing
what happened in my life,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:90%
it had meaning for me.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:90%
I saw, oh, this is changing.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling better.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm acting better.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting better results.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And so now that ritual
had meaning for me,

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's probably one of the
most important things in ritual

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is meaning?

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.635 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah,
because how many of us

00:23:42.635 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
have grown up in families where
our parents sort of dragged us

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.914 align:middle line:84%
through their rituals
of their own tradition?

00:23:48.914 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But they were
more unconscious rituals

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
that were just habitual.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well
sometimes, and some of us

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
got dragged to
Thanksgiving dinners,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and we set around with
all these family members

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and no one wanted
really to be there.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And half the family
wasn't talking

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to the other half,
and we-- and as kids,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
we had to get all dressed up and
sit there and behave ourselves,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't have
meaning for us.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But maybe as we got
older, taking Thanksgiving

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
as an example, we thought,
well this is a good thing.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I like this.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to make it something
valuable for my family.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So then we began creating
meaning in that ritual.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It was something, you know,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Thanksgiving is an
American holiday--

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and I guess in Canada there's
also-- but we-- but by making

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
it something that
had personal meaning,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%

a great question.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I think
most of us know

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have untapped
potential inside of us

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're just
not making use of.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And rituals are really
the age-old, time-tested,

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and today scientifically
proven way

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.845 align:middle line:84%
that people can tap
those unaccessed riches,

00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
those-- that potential
that's there.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard this metaphor
that life is like a river,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and yet most of
us spend our lives

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
sort of at the

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: It's
a grind, exactly.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Rituals are a way of taking
the boat of our life,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
if I can say that,
and bringing it back

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the river.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is aligning our life

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
with who we are at
the deepest level.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%

fundamental role

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.401 align:middle line:84%

ceremonial rituals,

00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:90%

>>ATTWOOD: That-- that
ceremonial ritual--

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But rituals, in
general, are a way

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of getting aligned
with what in the book

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
we call your unique life's
design because all of us

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:84%
are born with a
design for our life.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, our
job when we're born

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:90%
is to discover what is that.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:90%

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So rituals are a way
of creating alignment.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The way we know
that we're aligned

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.187 align:middle line:84%

we are having fun.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.682 align:middle line:90%
It becomes comfortable and easy.

00:26:27.682 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%

around the next bend.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.392 align:middle line:84%

tend to be very fast edits.

00:34:58.392 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, they have
to be because people don't

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
have the attention
span any longer.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly my point.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well,
and you know, what's

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:84%
happened-- because we labeled
ritual as superstition,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:90%
what happened is we rejected it.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
in today's society,

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes not so much for
our parents' generation,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but in our generation and
younger, that what you see

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is that people have
gotten caught up

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in a culture of
achievement, of I

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
have to do more and be
more and accomplish more

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to get ahead,
to be successful,

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to live the life
that I want to live.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we've discovered is
it becomes counterproductive.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens, as you
were referring to I think also,

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is that you see
that 25% of women

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
are on antidepressants today.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.178 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: The use of
antidepressants generally

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
has multiplied 400
times since the '80s.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:84%
That we see that a 1/3
of Americans are obese.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.410 align:middle line:84%
We see that teen suicide
is the number three

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:84%
cause of death
among young adults.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: So these
things are just

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:84%
indicators that we
need to recalibrate

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.390 align:middle line:90%
our culture and our system.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I believe
this book is so important,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
because we now know through
science that rituals, in fact,

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
create very positive outcomes,
and that they can, in fact,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:84%
allow us to deal with
this immense overload

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that every one of
us has to deal with.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And when we feel
overwhelmed, rituals

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
give us a way to come
back to ourselves

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.265 align:middle line:90%
and restore ourselves.

00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
talk a little bit

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
about the science of rituals
and what it actually-- what

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.424 align:middle line:90%
has been proven?

00:36:36.424 --> 00:36:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Sure.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's an immense body
of research on meditation,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.691 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
I'm sure you've--

00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tibetan study
and everything, yes.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.356 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Talked about
that in many contexts.

00:36:46.356 --> 00:36:49.334 align:middle line:84%
In terms of ritual
practice generally, there's

00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:51.000 align:middle line:84%
a number of things
that have been found.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Andrew Newberg, I
mentioned earlier, probably

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.871 align:middle line:84%
the leading neuroscientist who
study the effect of ritual.

00:36:57.871 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And meditation, right?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: And meditation also.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: "God in the Brain"
and all this great books.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.239 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: That's right.

00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And what he said,
what they found,

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.995 align:middle line:84%
is that ritual creates a
balance between the sympathetic,

00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So these different parts
of our nervous system,

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that one which excites us,
and one which calms us down.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, that
different kinds of rituals

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.810 align:middle line:84%
can create different
effects, but then they

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
bring the two
systems into balance.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we've
all seen rituals

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of dancing in traditional
cultures-- drumming

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and dancing-- and
oftentimes those people

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:84%
will go into a
hyper-alert state.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you study them
neural-physiologically what you

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:84%
see is that they're very active,
but then they're-- they come

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to a settled place
of mind and emotions,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that there's this simultaneous
thing going on of rest

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and awake alertness
at the same time.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's been seen
in meditation as well.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is a calming
ritual, calming activity,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and yet you see that the
mind becomes alert and awake.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.955 align:middle line:84%
So from both ends-- and I
found it really fascinating--

00:38:12.955 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
because of course I've been
immersed in meditation for so

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
long-- I was familiar
with that research.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But when he mentioned
that even when

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.720 align:middle line:84%
you study people who are engaged
in these very active rituals,

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that when they go into this
hyper-state, that sometimes

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
called-- sometimes a trance
state or one thing or another,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a physiological
change that takes place,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and as a result
there's a balance

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.457 align:middle line:84%
created between these two
aspects of our nervous system.

00:38:38.457 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a parasympathetic
response, essentially,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.095 align:middle line:84%
ritual does, because it's
got a calming effect.

00:38:45.095 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And it can.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: It can.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, meditation
creates alertness.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Meditation naturally
has that effect

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:56.380 align:middle line:84%
of calming, but then
with increased alertness.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
The dance, you have
increased activity,

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
but then afterwards
this calming effect.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, as it-- in the
case of the athlete, of course,

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.488 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't create
a calming effect.

00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:07.600 align:middle line:90%
They have the stimulus.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.725 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Hyper-alertness.

00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly, right.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you and I both
have young daughters,

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and in the past we've
talked about there

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
being the absence of the
ritual for the coming of age

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of a young girl when
their bodies change.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are, in different
religious contexts,

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the coming of age ceremonies and
the rites of passage ceremonies

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, but
when a young girl

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.455 align:middle line:84%
goes into the
change in her body,

00:39:31.455 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:84%
it's so-- it's scary sometimes,
and they don't understand.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They get their
period, and there's

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of terror around
that for young girls.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So it would be so great to
create something that really

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.170 align:middle line:84%
honors that process,
as a young girl,

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to understand the changes of
her body and what it's about.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And you have a beautiful video
here that the Native Americans

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
have created-- a
ritual that they've

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
created around the coming
of age for a young girl.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really think
it's helpful to see

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that type of ceremonial ritual.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:84%
In some way in the modern
world it's gotten lost,

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.760 align:middle line:84%
yet that still exists
on a daily basis.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.990 align:middle line:84%
There's ways that we can
take those types of rituals

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:00.304 align:middle line:84%
and reform them for
our modern lives.

00:45:00.304 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Absolutely.

>>LISA: What are some of
the other ones that you

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
have written about in the

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:84%
water down a little
bit or make our own?

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Well, I'll tell you
how I'm adapting some of those

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:90%
rituals--

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good word.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.579 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: --to my children,
because as you mentioned,

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I've got two daughters.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Now they're too
young yet to be going

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:84%
through that physical
change in their body,

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:84%
but I've been thinking about
it, because during the writing

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of the book we interviewed
this amazing Yoruban woman, who

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:84%
now lives in Los Angeles
but grew up in Nigeria.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And what she told us is her life
was always filled with ritual.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.610 align:middle line:90%
She took it for granted.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything you did,
even greeting someone,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.620 align:middle line:84%
was a ritual that,
depending upon whether they

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.900 align:middle line:84%
were in front of you
or coming up beside you

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:84%
or coming up from
behind, there would

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:84%
be a different way
of greeting them.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow,
that's fascinating.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But the story that had
the biggest impact on me

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.390 align:middle line:84%
is when she described
her coming of age.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And about a year before she
was about to start her period,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the elders, the women
elders of the village,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.695 align:middle line:84%
sat down with her
several times and put

00:46:07.695 --> 00:46:10.090 align:middle line:84%
in context what was
happening for her.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you are a woman--
you are becoming a woman,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and as a woman you are
so fortunate because you

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.600 align:middle line:84%
are becoming a
co-creator of life.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:84%
No man can be born without
coming through a woman's womb,

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and so you have this great
role and responsibility.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge opportunity.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And your body is going
to go through this change

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to enable you to be able
to give birth to children,

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of
the highest things

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that a woman-- or
a person can do.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the best
and most wonderful things

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.070 align:middle line:90%
that could happen to anyone.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when she
actually got to the day,

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:51.144 align:middle line:84%
and her body started this new
experience, she was so excited.

00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Excited.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: She ran in to tell
her mom, and her mom went, yes!

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And they went out and got
all the women in the village,

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.081 align:middle line:84%
and they made a big feast,
and they celebrated--

00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wouldn't that be nice?

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: --this change.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.645 align:middle line:84%
And they dress her up in white
and put her up on a pedestal.

00:47:06.645 --> 00:47:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A mount.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: In front
of the whole group,

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the whole village, and it
was just a celebratory right.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And the elders sat with
her again and connected her

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to her ancestors, to the
tradition that she was now

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.960 align:middle line:84%
a part of, and they made
her feel so special.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
ritual and others

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:32.220 align:middle line:84%
as she was growing up, even as
she went to England to study,

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.020 align:middle line:84%
as she came to America
to live, that they

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.160 align:middle line:90%
made her feel special.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:84%
She never had any
self esteem issues.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.370 align:middle line:84%
She said, I always
knew I was special.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I always knew I was beautiful.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that was
because of those rituals.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.684 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It linked to
other things in her life.

00:47:47.684 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Absolutely.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.780 align:middle line:84%
As young women today
in America, they

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:84%
start their periods so
much younger, so telling

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.100 align:middle line:84%
a 12-year-old they're
going to give birth

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work anymore.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And it could have to
do with the hormones

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.219 align:middle line:84%
that they're eating
in foods these days,

00:48:03.219 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and genetically modified.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean their bodies are
changing so much faster,

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.950 align:middle line:84%
at least in the west, that there
has to be another way that you

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:84%
can actually gradually
step up to that level,

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that maybe that
teenage girl was at.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So can we modify
these rituals in order

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.494 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to changing times?

00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Sure.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm doing with my girls.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.146 align:middle line:84%
My six-year-old is
just starting school,

00:48:31.146 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and so this is a big
transition, right?

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.978 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rite of passage, yes.

00:48:33.978 --> 00:48:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And so I
took the whole family

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.300 align:middle line:84%
to a special place, and we--
she spent a day with her mom,

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:84%
a day with me, and
then a day where

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.490 align:middle line:84%
we celebrated this
new experience.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
She was now becoming
a young girl

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.660 align:middle line:90%
who would be going to school.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
a way of preparing.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no physical change
that's taking place,

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
but by celebrating this
significant transition, now

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we have begun the
process of making

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that a pattern in
our family's life.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because when she
is ready, when she

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
gets to be around 10,
11, 12, in that age,

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:84%
then I am planning to take the
elders in our village, which

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is my business partner, Janet
Bray Attwood, who you know.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.100 align:middle line:84%

off to a very special place

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.979 align:middle line:84%

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Just
enjoying being a woman,

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking probably
of someplace like Hawaii,

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.390 align:middle line:84%
someplace that's very
feminine in its nature.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yes.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: That she
can realize that this

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.910 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful time in her life,
something to look forward to,

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:53.120 align:middle line:84%
as well as covering the
practical things of what

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.330 align:middle line:84%
does that mean, in terms
of relating to boys

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and doing things like that.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like it's
important that girls today,

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.060 align:middle line:84%
not only with their parents
but with other elders

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.830 align:middle line:84%
that they respect, that
they have the opportunity

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to learn about this
transition, learn

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:11.930 align:middle line:90%
about what it means for them.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think for
me, I'll tell you

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
when she gets to
be 11 or 12, but I

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.530 align:middle line:84%
think this is a way that we
can adapt these transition

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:24.324 align:middle line:84%
rituals so that our children are
prepared for the changes that

00:50:24.324 --> 00:50:25.490 align:middle line:90%
are happening in their life.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll do another
one when she becomes

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.870 align:middle line:84%
21, when each of our children
becomes 21, that now taking

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.360 align:middle line:84%
on that mantel of
responsibility.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so many
different areas in life,

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.943 align:middle line:84%
or times of life,
where you go through

00:50:35.943 --> 00:50:38.050 align:middle line:90%
these major transitions.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean the first time
that you have sex,

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and all these
different things, where

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.910 align:middle line:84%
you go through these
huge transitions in life

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that you can look
back on as an adult

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh my god,
that was horrific,

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:84%
or you could actually
get ahead of the curve.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.554 align:middle line:84%
And menopause, I mean you could
create a ritual for menopause.

00:50:52.554 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Absolutely.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.681 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rather than the--

00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.594 align:middle line:84%
--mystery around menopause
and the hot flashes

00:50:57.594 --> 00:50:58.260 align:middle line:90%
that go with it.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You can create different
types of ritual around it.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.850 align:middle line:84%
For aging parents, as they're
going into decade changes

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that they never
thought that they

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.940 align:middle line:90%
would know how to deal with.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.030 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different ways
that you can create rituals.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:17.854 align:middle line:84%
What are-- The book is just
recently coming out, right,

00:51:17.854 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:84%
so you haven't really
gotten a lot of response

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.751 align:middle line:84%
back from what's
working yet for people,

00:51:21.751 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:84%
or what rituals they're
creating in their life, right?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, a little bit.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A little bit?

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Because
we've been talking

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.680 align:middle line:84%
about it for some months now,
and the book is coming out,

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'll share that.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to just comment on
this aspect of life transition

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:38.690 align:middle line:90%
rituals.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that this
Yoruban woman shared with us

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is that when she became 60,
which is the traditional age

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to become an elder
of the village,

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that there's a whole week-long
ceremony that they have

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:84%
for this coming of
age, the entering

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.180 align:middle line:90%
into the age of wisdom.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting, yes.

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And three of
the women from her village

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.850 align:middle line:84%
flew all the way from
Nigeria to Los Angeles

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to be here for this
very special occasion.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- See, I don't think
most people in our society

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:84%
who turn 60 actually have the
opportunity to celebrate and be

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:84%
recognized as someone who is
looked to for wisdom and advice

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and guidance.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's such an
important, invaluable way

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that we can honor the elder
members of our society

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:84%
who have had a lot of
experience, who have things

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that they could share with
us that could make younger

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:36.140 align:middle line:84%
people be able to have
a smoother, easier life.

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:90%
So I love that.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But coming back to what
have people created.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We have something we call
the 30-Day Ritual Challenge,

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really
wonderful, simple way

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.795 align:middle line:84%
for people to begin to get
a taste of how powerful can

00:52:48.795 --> 00:52:50.250 align:middle line:90%
ritual be in your life.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And the basic
concept is is first

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:90%
get clear on your five passions.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the Passion Test.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we guide
people through creating

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.300 align:middle line:84%
their own three-minute
ritual that they'll

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.780 align:middle line:90%
perform daily for 30 days.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And part of that ritual
is setting an intention,

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and we invite them
to set an intention

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
to make one significant change
and say what that change will

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.220 align:middle line:84%
be that will help them get
aligned with their passions

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And so as people have
gone through this,

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.850 align:middle line:84%
they'll do lots of
different things.

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And one woman, she spends
most of her days working

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.290 align:middle line:84%
on the computer,
she works from home.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.174 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'd
gotten into such a grind

00:53:26.174 --> 00:53:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that I would just get
on in the morning,

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'd sometimes
forget to eat, and I'd

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.140 align:middle line:84%
be exhausted at
the end of the day.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the ritual that she
instituted is that she said,

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to smell the
roses, so to speak.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:38.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:53:38.795 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: She said I'm going
to take three minutes-- five

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:46.110 align:middle line:84%
minutes, actually, to
get up, go outside,

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go
for a short walk,

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
look for flowers,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.335 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to consciously
stop, notice, smell them, enjoy

00:53:54.335 --> 00:53:57.330 align:middle line:84%
them, and bring that
experience into my life

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:59.300 align:middle line:84%
because I don't get
that on the computer.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said that it was
so fun and so wonderful

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and made such an impact
even on her productivity

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that she now does
it in the morning,

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.234 align:middle line:84%
and she does it again in
the afternoon, every hour

00:54:11.234 --> 00:54:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and a 1/2 or so.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Instead of maybe
eating, or anything else

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that she was doing that was
more of an unconscious ritual,

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:84%
she does that as
an intentional one.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: That's right.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Eating while she's
on the computer.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right-- unconscious.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So we also didn't talk about the
men, and their coming of age,

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and the Bar Mitzvah
and all sorts

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.750 align:middle line:84%
of different ceremonies
for men as well.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:84%
What would you
recommend for a coming

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:90%
of age as a male teenager maybe?

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: For young
men, it's an opportunity

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:42.560 align:middle line:90%
to prove yourself.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.490 align:middle line:84%
The coming of age
ceremonies for men

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:48.080 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes involve a
challenge of some sort.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's a thing that builds
the character of the men.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It allows them to connect
with their own strength,

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and their own-- and gain
confidence in their own ability

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make
something happen.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.410 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient days it was
going out and going on a hunt

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:84%
all by themselves,
but today it could

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.230 align:middle line:84%
be different kinds
of challenges.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:14.587 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the stories with
a modern day shaman, who also

00:55:14.587 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:84%
happens to be a minister--
I thought that was very

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:22.450 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- a Protestant
minister-- that he conducts

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:25.950 align:middle line:84%
coming of age ceremonies
for young people,

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and with a young man who
is seven years of age,

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.810 align:middle line:84%
he said-- he gave
him a challenge.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, imagine that you're
with two of your friends,

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and you come in the middle
of the road to a bag,

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and each of you is blind.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:44.880 align:middle line:90%
All three of you are blind.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And you come to the bag,
and you find in the bag

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are two-- I think
two or three-- three eyes.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.625 align:middle line:90%
There's the opportunity to see.

00:55:55.625 --> 00:56:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh no, sorry, there was-- I
think there was only two eyes.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
do with this bag?

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.897 align:middle line:84%
Well, what would you do
with this ability to see?

00:56:05.897 --> 00:56:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And the young boys--

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Two additional
sets of eyes?

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Well, and what he
meant was two abilities to see.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: As opposed to
physical eyes-- but two

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.820 align:middle line:90%
things-- the ability to see.

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I would
give them to my friends

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.620 align:middle line:90%
so that they could see.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, wouldn't you
want to keep one for yourself?

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.001 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, it
wouldn't be so important,

00:56:26.001 --> 00:56:29.024 align:middle line:84%
because I would've gotten
used to not being able to see,

00:56:29.024 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and I would want them
to be able to see.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh--interesting.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: And there's no
right answer to the challenge,

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:40.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's just an example
of giving a young boy

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.390 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to see
how would I handle myself,

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.050 align:middle line:90%
what would I do?

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I know some families
that we interviewed

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.180 align:middle line:84%
that were
traditionally-- actually

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:84%
this man, for his young
boy-- when he became

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.810 align:middle line:84%
a young man, a little
older, about 13 years old,

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:84%
they took him out
to a remote area,

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.870 align:middle line:90%
and he had to camp with nothing.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.990 align:middle line:84%
He had no tent, no
food, no anything.

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:05.455 align:middle line:90%
Now his father has trained him.

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's just like
the Native American tradition.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:08.496 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Yeah.

00:57:08.496 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:84%
He had to go out, and
he had to, for-- he

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:12.940 align:middle line:84%
had to spend a night
and a day all by himself

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and find his way back
to where they were.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Now he said set it up so
that he could watch is son,

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.180 align:middle line:84%
so that he could
pay attention to--

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Be safe--yeah.

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.715 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: What was going
on so he could feel safe,

00:57:22.715 --> 00:57:25.780 align:middle line:84%
but still it was an opportunity
for the boy to prove himself.

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And for boys more
than girls I would

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.340 align:middle line:84%
say that it's really
important that young men have

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.850 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to see
that they can do things

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:38.540 align:middle line:84%
without their parents, without
help from their-- from anyone

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.190 align:middle line:84%
else, that they
have that ability

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.506 align:middle line:84%
to be self sufficient
if they need to be.

00:57:43.506 --> 00:57:45.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to feel
safe at the same time.

00:57:45.255 --> 00:57:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: That's right.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if some wanted
to create their own ritual,

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.840 align:middle line:84%
they would need to
set an intention,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.240 align:middle line:84%
they would need
to have something

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.210 align:middle line:84%
to do with meaning
in their life,

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.470 align:middle line:90%
and what's another aspect of it?

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Everyday
rituals are really simple,

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.505 align:middle line:84%
and intention can be a
ritual in and of itself,

00:58:02.505 --> 00:58:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that you decide I'm
going to take a minute--

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Or two minutes
when I wake up in the morning,

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.771 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to set the
intention for what am I going

00:58:09.771 --> 00:58:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to do--

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That could
be the ritual.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.658 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: What am I
going to accomplish today?

00:58:12.658 --> 00:58:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Or we all take a
shower-- what if you just

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:17.460 align:middle line:84%
take-- while you're
taking a shower

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.800 align:middle line:84%
you thought what am
I grateful for today.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is your time
of prayer or something--yes.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: That's right.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So everyday rituals are
things of just saying

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.730 align:middle line:90%
what will serve me?

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:29.360 align:middle line:84%
What will help me
to be more at ease,

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to have more balance in my life,
to be focused on the things

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that I really want to
experience in my life--

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.340 align:middle line:84%
all of those things--
and they don't

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.000 align:middle line:90%
have to take up a lot of time.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Now ceremonial rituals
are more involved.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, Lisa, as we
did the research on this book,

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.710 align:middle line:84%
we found looking at
traditions all over the world,

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:49.760 align:middle line:84%
ceremonial rituals have
seven distinct aspects.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you can create a
simple ceremonial ritual.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
take a lot of time,

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.220 align:middle line:84%
but it does involve
more aspects than just

00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to set an intention.

00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:00.665 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: You know--

00:59:00.665 --> 00:59:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's linked
more to tradition.

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.585 align:middle line:84%
>>ATTWOOD: Or things that
are meaningful to you.

00:59:05.585 --> 00:59:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The one most important
thing about ritual

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is what you said, is that it
has personal meaning for you,

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's what will keep
you doing it again and again

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:15.247 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:59:15.247 --> 00:59:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.095 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:18.761 align:middle line:84%
There's been-- I've
learned a lot here.

00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
about the rituals

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that I have that I didn't
know that I had in my life,

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:28.371 align:middle line:84%
and also connecting to a deeper
sense of ritual in modern day

00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:28.870 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:29.775 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:59:29.775 --> 00:59:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Thank you, Lisa.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating information.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ATTWOOD: Such a pleasure.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.020 align:middle line:84%
