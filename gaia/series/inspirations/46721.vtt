00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And we are broadcasting
live from the Conscious Life

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Expo in Los Angeles.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So, in today's rapidly
changing business climate,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
those who are most
creative, and innovative,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.664 align:middle line:84%
and open to new ideas are
usually the most successful.

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether you work for
yourself, or you're

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
a part of a small business,
or even a large corporation,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
do you feel that changes
are really needed?

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, my guest today, author
and business consultant,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.915 align:middle line:84%
John Murphy, wrote a
book called Zentrepeneur.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And he believes today's
business leaders have a lot

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to learn from the
ancient art of Zen.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Which, I agree, personally.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.634 align:middle line:84%
But not always easy to do
in a corporate environment.

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN MURPHY: No, it's not.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:10%
It's very difficult
sometimes because

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:10%
of the pressure,
of the intensity.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:10%
But that's where presence
is so powerful and valuable.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:10%
I liken it to
sports, in some ways.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:10%
Like I was a
quarterback growing up.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:10%
And when we walk up to
the line of scrimmage,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
we've called a play,
it's part of a game plan,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:10%
it's part of a strategy.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We've practiced it over,
and over, and over.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.286 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is when
that ball is snapped,

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
you really don't know
what's going to happen.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, all
those plans need

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.822 align:middle line:84%
to be in the back of your mind
and ready to come about, right?

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That's right.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to be present,
you need to be poised,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
you need to be relaxed, you
need to relax into the moment

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and let flow, as
I like to put it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't, I mean,
the whole team senses fear.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid--
so in business,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
of course, if the leader
is afraid, and many are,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
many are terrified,
the team senses it.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.647 align:middle line:84%
And with things like the law
of attraction, if we're afraid,

00:01:57.647 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
we attract more to be afraid of.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered about
the mindset of a quarterback.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to tie
into this conversation.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.714 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing about football,
but you are really the chief

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
out there, aren't you?

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.213 align:middle line:84%
You're really
controlling the entire--

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
so whatever you are feeling,
the rest of the team

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to feel and
your opponent, right?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.858 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, you're
a conduit, really.

00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean the whole team matters.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:90%
The whole team is critical.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to harmonize
like an orchestra.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean everybody's got
to play their part.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Timing is essential.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be in step,
so to speak, with time.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Same thing in
business, you know.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.259 align:middle line:84%
If we get out of step,
if we get out of sync,

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the left hand doesn't know
what the right hand's doing.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with a
dysfunctional organization.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why didn't you
continue in your career

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.456 align:middle line:90%
as a quarterback?

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: I just--

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.937 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not your thing?

00:02:52.937 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I reached
my limit, I think,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
in that particular space.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my calling.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had many challenges
growing up that tested me.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in high school, I ran
my foot through a lawnmower

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
when I was 17 and was told
I would never play again.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I was told I'd never walk
again without limping

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
by an internationally
renowned, award

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
winning, patented--
many patents, in fact--

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.787 align:middle line:90%
orthopedic surgeon.

00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is in the
heighth of your career?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.328 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: This was just after
we won the state championship

00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:90%
in 1976.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.161 align:middle line:90%
And I was coming in as a senior.

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: This is my passion.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.259 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:37.191 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And I was nominated
captain for the team.

00:03:37.191 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a big deal.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I had high hopes.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Also this is one of
my first businesses.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I had started a business.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:84%
We had about 40 or
50 customers where

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.365 align:middle line:90%
we cut lawns and landscaped.

00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And we had 13
lawns to cut that day.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:90%
And this was the second one.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
A customer had
asked me to cut down

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
some real tall grass
in the backyard, which

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a normal
part of the deal,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle line:84%
because she was going
to throw a lawn party

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted a
little more space.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I had this old
lawnmower and foolishly

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.781 align:middle line:90%
tripped over a rock backing up.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.156 align:middle line:84%
Which they say you should
never do that with a lawnmower.

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever back up.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, seven days
in the hospital

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and 10 hours of
reconstruction surgeries.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
A couple surgeries later,
I was told give it up.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Football.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Give it up, you're done.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the
hospital and I get

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
a book sent to me
from my grandfather

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's a book on courage.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the stories in
this book is on Rocky Bleier.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Rocky Bleier was a Notre
Dame grad football player.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Too small, too slow
to make it in the NFL,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
so many people thought.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But managed to get drafted
by the Pittsburgh Steelers

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:90%
kind of last round.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Before he ever played, he
was drafted off to Vietnam.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Vietnam, he had severe
injuries, hamstring, gunfire,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and shrapnel.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
He basically blew
off part of his foot.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:90%
And was told the same thing.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll never play
football again.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Go sell cars or something else.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
He rehabbed for three years, got
faster than he ever was before,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
made the Pittsburgh
Steelers again,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.949 align:middle line:84%
ended up the starting tailback,
and had four Super Bowls

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:90%
as the starting tailback.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there reading
this book in the hospital,

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
thinking, maybe
I'm not done yet.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But, you had to be
strong mentally in order

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to even take that
story on and even

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
to get up off that hospital bed.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.305 align:middle line:90%
Even to go back.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.055 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Oh yeah.

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:50.552 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And where did that
mental strength start from?

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you learn that?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It's in the heart.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the mind.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.934 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the head.

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people think the
mind is all about the head.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:90%
The heart's much more powerful.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
research that says

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:84%
it's at least a 10 to 1
ratio in terms of power.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Emotional intelligence,
so to speak.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And something stirred
me up in that moment

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and I just made a decision.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.399 align:middle line:90%
I'm not done yet.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.398 align:middle line:84%
And two years later I was
playing at Notre Dame.

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But I was playing behind
a guy named Joe Montana.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.604 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So you asked why I didn't
make it any further.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.876 align:middle line:90%

00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:29.415 align:middle line:84%

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:29.956 align:middle line:90%

>>MURPHY: Mmhmm, I am.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now what do you do
when you go into a company?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
title that you're

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
called is a corporate culture
consultant, is that right?

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I'm committed
100% of my time

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
right now to a major
US corporation.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: They're global.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the world.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There's 62,000 people and
over $10 billion in sales.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a very big company.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm still an independent
consultant with my own company.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It's turning 26 this year.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But they have named
me a Vice President

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
of Business Transformation.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the term.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Business transformation.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking for
transformational culture

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
A whole shift in energy and
in organizational habit,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
which is just another
term for culture.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, people individually
know how difficult

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.252 align:middle line:90%
it is to break habits.

00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
You set a New Year's resolution
and two weeks later, you're

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:90%
struggling to keep it, right?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Forgot
completely about it.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, imagine
that with 60,000 people.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Organizational habits,
culture change, is powerful.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They run deep.

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I use
the term culture's

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the way we do
things around here.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple way
to understand it:

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
just the way we do
things around here.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.433 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to look
at the way we do things

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
around here, you start to
realize it's full of waste,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:90%
it's full of inefficiency.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
We lose sight of the
clients and the customers.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.074 align:middle line:84%
We get stressed,
we get frustrated,

00:08:07.074 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
we ended up spending
half our day,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.895 align:middle line:84%
if not more than that,
on wasteful things.

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:12.395 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we try to change,
we try to express ideas,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we try to get good
changes made, and we

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.375 align:middle line:90%
keep running into the system.

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:20.457 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
talk about, for example,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
this company that
you work with and you

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
don't need to disclose
the name, but what

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
are some of the
inherent challenges that

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
come from large corporations?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.772 align:middle line:84%
Now this conversation
is also for anyone.

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
You could be an
employee, you could

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
be the customer of
this type of business,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
what are some of their
challenges with companies

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.881 align:middle line:90%
that are that big?

00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, number
one, this company's stock

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
is at record highs.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Their earnings are
at record highs.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the few
AAA rated companies

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
left in the United States.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.704 align:middle line:84%
So it's got every
reason to not change.

00:08:53.704 --> 00:08:54.995 align:middle line:90%
It's like why should we change?

00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's OK, yeah.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: So complacency is a
problem for a lot of companies.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You go into protectionism,
you go into defense.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And you let go of what got you
started in the first place.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.226 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Innovation, creativity.

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So this company is saying, we
need to go back to our roots.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And we need to innovate.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.464 align:middle line:84%
And we need to simplify
some of the things

00:09:20.464 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:90%
that we have going on.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:90%
We've become very complicated.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
I love a quote from Einstein.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Einstein once said,
"Any intelligent fool

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
can make things bigger
and more complex.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It takes a touch of genius
and a lot of courage

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.491 align:middle line:84%
to move in the
opposite direction."

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: That's become
this company's new mantra.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
We need to move toward
simplification and innovation,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
not just complication and
incremental improvement.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you explained to me
once something called the war

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
room, where you go in and
you create this environment.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what this is like.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.745 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of what I mean
by quarterbacking a company.

00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Sure.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, we've done
several of these events

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%
now for this client.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing these
events for many, many years.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of awakening.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we
assemble a team.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
We train the team
in about three days.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And then for the next
30 days, the team

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:84%
collects what we call
the brutal facts.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We go out and talk to
clients and customers,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
we map out a key
process that represents

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the way we do
things around here,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
we bring in people from
different parts of the business

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to all share their perspective,
and we get the data.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring the leadership
team in and we walk the wall.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.622 align:middle line:84%
And we have some rules
that are kind of funny.

00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it a
serious environment

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.235 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing this?

00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we bring in
the leadership team.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we don't
give them any chairs.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So you don't come
in and sit down

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
around a big conference room.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And we don't
use any PowerPoints.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.865 align:middle line:84%
We don't use any video
equipment or visual equipment

00:10:58.865 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
at all other than what's
up on the walls, which

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is flip charts, and post-its,
and graphs, and charts.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, you cannot
interrupt for 20 minutes.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:84%
You give us 20 minutes
without interruption

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
while we tell you our story
about how we do business.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
Undercover Boss where

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going into
in your own business

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're shocked
by what you see.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
You're like I can't
believe we take

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that long to do that, I
can't believe we actually

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:84%
have our associates
or our employees

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
struggling the
way they struggle.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of thing.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So in 20 minutes
we tell our story

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and then we open it up
for questions and answers.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times you
can hear a pin drop.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So we brought the CEO
of this $10 plus billion

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
company and his top 10,
well, 11 direct reports.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So there were 12 of
them who came in.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And now just to put it in
perspective, the old way,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
the old culture was
one person would

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
go in front of the executive
committee with PowerPoints.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As the consultant?

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, it
could be a consultant

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:90%
or a couple of consultants.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Or one of the more senior
managers in the company saying,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.374 align:middle line:90%
this is what we want to do.

00:12:14.374 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't get past,
like, the third slide,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and the questions would
come in, and the debates,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and the arguments,
and this and that.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:90%
So then they'd often--

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the defense?

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Sure.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd table
it for next month.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.749 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: And then next month.

00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So I just finished
an event this week

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
with this client where
we got more change done

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
in four and a half days than
they said in the last seven

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They've been trying to fix
this process for seven years.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
biggest breakdowns

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that companies have-- large
and small companies-- is it

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:90%
with employees?

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it with structure?

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it with the
inability to change?

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Ego.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ego?

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.597 align:middle line:90%
Explain.

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, it's
the ego thought system.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And so number one, when we get
into start talking about ego,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks that they've
got their own personal ego.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, his ego's
big, her ego's big.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The ego when you really
start to examine it,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:90%
it's a thought system.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Ego thinks the
same way no matter

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.377 align:middle line:90%
who has it, who holds it.

00:13:11.377 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of an
attachment we have.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So when we attach to
the ego thought system,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%
we live in fear.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.477 align:middle line:90%
The ego is afraid.

00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's insecure.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In survival.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, it's defensive.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's comparative.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It's always comparing.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
When we attach to it,
we're comparing ourselves

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:90%
to everybody else.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.023 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Competitive.

00:13:34.023 --> 00:13:37.969 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's competitive in a
dualistic us, them kind of way.

00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with
being competitive when

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
we're competing
against our own self.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Our own limitations,
our own standards,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:90%
trying to be a better person.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
personal best, yeah.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: But when we start
competing in such a way

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that in order for me to
win, you have to lose.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody has to lose
in that very dualistic way,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:90%
it's a very draining energy.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So cooperation's a much
more powerful energy

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
than competition.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it's what I bring
into businesses and teach,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
is once we start getting
people all on one page, aligned

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and playing like an
orchestra, it's awesome.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we're
pivoting against one another

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and playing politics and
trying to position ourselves

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.129 align:middle line:84%
for the next win-- and you see
it vividly in our government.

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a good example.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's a
lose-lose proposition.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: We all
suffer from that.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
example, actually.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Government's based on
corporation, right?

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:90%
So back in the founding days.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So we look at America
as-- what would you

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
say are the biggest
faults of America?

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
it as a corporation.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: In a word, ego.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more about how
do I get elected next term,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.541 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Not what's best for
this country right now.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:90%
We're in extraordinary debt.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.244 align:middle line:84%
We're over a trillion
dollars in debt.

00:14:56.244 --> 00:14:57.659 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
debt ceiling keeps

00:14:57.659 --> 00:14:58.812 align:middle line:90%
getting raised and raised.

00:14:58.812 --> 00:14:59.811 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: In fact, yeah.

00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't remember
exactly the date,

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
but if you Google, when's the
last time the United States was

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.869 align:middle line:84%
actually not in debt,
it was in the 1800s

00:15:08.869 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and it was only for a
short period of time.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
back into debt again.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds created.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.019 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And then
you got the government

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.727 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell people
they shouldn't be in debt.

00:15:18.727 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.625 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
that very thing.

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Really?

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmhmm.

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: You know?

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we get
into this place though?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
This place of overspending,
this place of getting into debt?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course, we model
it through our US-- companies

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:90%
have these challenges.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
corruption begins.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
We saw so much of that
with the corporate fallout.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you-- do
you see that coming?

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it a mile away?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Can you see scandals happening?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, yeah.

00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
it's the ego again,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
because the ego is
never satisfied.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And so as soon as the-- if
we're attached to that thought

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
system, and we get a degree,
the ego's basically saying,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:90%
you need another one.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You buy a nice house,
you need a bigger one.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You get a promotion, it's not
enough, you need another one.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:90%
So the ego's never satisfied.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we're attached
to that thought system,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
we're not living in peace.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly seeking more
attachments, if you will.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is when
we become attached to something,

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is the Zen piece of
it, attachment and aversions

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
tear us up because, as
soon as we become attached

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:90%
to something, we fear losing it.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.889 align:middle line:84%
Consciously or
subconsciously, we

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
fear losing things
we've attached to.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're people,
they're assets, they're jobs,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
they're titles,
they're whatever.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we actually go
through life afraid.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we live in fear, our
immune system breaks down.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.361 align:middle line:84%
This is where a lot of illness
and disease comes from.

00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And you can actually see this.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to speak
about it tonight.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You put human cells in a Petri
dish, and you add toxins,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:90%
and they run for the corners.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
You add nutrients and they
come right after the nutrients.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
You can't go in both
directions at the same time.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
stressed and you're

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
in a defense mode, reminds
me of football too,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the most points are
scored in the last two

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%

But you become vulnerable.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And we become vulnerable.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So yet, we've got to find
ways to get past that ego

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:90%
way of thinking and be free.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's
talk about some

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.887 align:middle line:84%
of the qualities of
the ancient art of Zen

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and how you can infuse those
into a corporation that

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.296 align:middle line:84%
has no previous context of
consciousness or spirituality.

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, the
first thing we have to do

OK.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of Zen, is being

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK so--

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And what's interesting
is the conscious mind

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
spends very little
time in the now.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind is always
looking forward or past.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is where
stress and fear is

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.405 align:middle line:84%
when the conscious
mind's looking forward.

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:07.822 align:middle line:84%
Uh, oh, something

And when the conscious mind

that's where we find
guilt, regret, shame.

OK, these are very
disempowering energies.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So in the business world,
we have to get present.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And how do we do that?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:90%
We start with taking score.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Taking measure.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:90%

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And I see

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:19:02.748 --> 00:19:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you take
weeks to do something that

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
should be done in
hours and you're

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to get a 10% improvement,
you're not even close.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I say is the
difference between improvement

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
and innovation.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people confuse the two.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Improvement, yeah, we've
got a 10% improvement,

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but if we were
really innovative,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we would have eliminated
it altogether.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.565 align:middle line:84%
Look what Jeff Bezos
is doing at Amazon.

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, Amazon's a big vendor,
a big distributor of mine.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And the process, the way it
works is they email an order,

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
you've got 48 hours to confirm
it and seven days to fill it.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything's timed and
sequenced like an orchestra.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And they respond very
quickly and very carefully

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:90%
to their customers.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's only two pieces
of paper in the whole system.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
When you confirm,
you download a label

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that goes on the
package and a pick

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
sheet that goes
inside the package.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.539 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: So here's what's
in the box or in the carton

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:90%
and here's a label.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.496 align:middle line:90%
And there's a barcode on it.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So when they receive it, they
scan the barcode and that wires

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:90%
money to you 60 days later.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no invoicing,
there's no back-- that's it.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.277 align:middle line:90%
It's very lean, it's very--

00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Clean.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Mmhmm.

>>MURPHY: Very clean.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.744 align:middle line:84%
Now Amazon's going, two

[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But how do we, you
know, so think about it

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
another way at Amazon.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
What put them in business
in the first place?

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.817 align:middle line:90%
Selling books, right?

00:20:31.817 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Selling books.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So now they're eliminating
the book as we know it.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.445 align:middle line:84%
Why do we even ship printed
books back and forth

00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:90%
all over the country?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.364 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just digitize it.

00:20:44.364 --> 00:20:46.155 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Why don't we
just beam it to you?

00:20:46.155 --> 00:20:46.655 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:46.655 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we do that?

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So the innovations they've made
with the Kindle, for example,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
go far beyond trying
to improve a printing

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:90%
process, or a shipping process.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.934 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not careful, look
at Blockbuster these days.

00:21:02.934 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:90%

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be there's always
such opposites in these type

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of corporations and
major corporations.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it exists
in all corporations

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
where the company's
doing really well,

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
but the employees are
overworked and underpaid.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There are top executives making
a lot of money and layoffs

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
on the other end.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you bridge the gap so
that you don't create animosity

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
within the people
that are working

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:90%
to make the company work?

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, well,
when I work with people,

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.311 align:middle line:84%
and I work with
people at all levels,

00:21:43.311 --> 00:21:46.949 align:middle line:84%
I mean from CEOs right
down to the front line,

00:21:46.949 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and I teach them how to
get out of their own way.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter
what level they're at.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:10%
We're all in our own way,
more than when we know.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:10%
The subconscious mind, which
is a million times more

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:10%
powerful than the
conscious mind, dominates.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It runs over 95% of our day.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And if it's
subconscious, that means

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:90%
it's beneath our consciousness.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
what it's thinking.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's our auto pilot.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's our habitual mind
as Wayne Dyer likes to call it.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And, you know the research that
Dr. Bruce Lipton's done on this

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:90%
is awesome.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And so if the conscious
mind can process

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
40 bits of data per second
and the subconscious 40

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:84%
million bits of data

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
no wonder will power, which
is the conscious mind,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
struggles to actually
sustain change.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we try to will
our way to do certain things

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious
mind takes over and says,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to do that.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, there's

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.279 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
There's emotional freedom
technique, meridian tapping,

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
there's the quick
coherence technique,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
which is a meditative technique.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we clear these
constraints, these blockages

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in our being, and we get
into flow, true flow,

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:11.979 align:middle line:90%
we astonish ourselves.

00:23:11.979 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So going back to your
question about people

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
in any organization,
CEOs are afraid.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.179 align:middle line:90%
Senior executives are afraid.

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Now some of us might say,
what are you afraid of?

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of what, yeah.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%

00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:26.068 align:middle line:90%
the rest of your life.

00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:90%
What are you afraid of?

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Trust me, they're afraid.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And they'll tell you that.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And what keeps them up at night?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
They've got lists of things.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're at
a very senior level

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or we're at the ground
level, the real mastery

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
is in getting out

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%

00:25:11.992 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for
the air I breathe.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.467 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful for my children.

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for the
fact that they've

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
got something warm to wear and
they've got a school to go to

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%

And things like that.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
When we get into that
consciousness of gratitude,

of appreciation, of
joy, and you don't

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%

you know, you're

And I don't.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I start my morning with
20 minutes of meditation.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.345 align:middle line:84%
I use usually a Taoist
meditation that I really like.

00:26:26.345 --> 00:26:27.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to teach it tonight.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:90%
I'd turn on the news.

stress, despair,

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that anymore.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I wake up now and I get into
a very deep and very grateful

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:90%
breathing and meditation.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I use certain healing
sounds to start my day off

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:90%
on a really positive note.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I do what I love
to do, which is to teach.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Some days I write.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now is that meditation,
the Taoist meditation,

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
something that you
could take us through?

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.062 align:middle line:90%
Is it a longer meditation or?

00:27:16.062 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, I'll give
you a couple of them.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
meditation does is it

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
focuses on your
five vital organs

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
as the Taoists
traditionally teach.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Tao, by the
way, is for those

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:84%
who aren't familiar
with it, it's T-A-O.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And Tao is of the Tao
Te Ching, and it's

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:90%
all about the great current.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:90%
The great flow of life.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So to think about the Tao,
it's like a blade of grass

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.064 align:middle line:90%

>>MURPHY: It just grows.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.389 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Because it's its essence.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
An oak tree doesn't have
to try to be an oak tree

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and grow strong and tall.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It just does because
it's supposed to.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.785 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand
the Tao and we apply it

00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
in our own lives,
we're not supposed

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%

>>MURPHY: And I
thought that for years.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Is if you want to be successful,
you have to work hard,

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and you have to do
all these things.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.795 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And as long as
we believe that, then that

00:28:21.795 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:90%
will have to be true for us.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But what if we believe
something different?

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:84%
What if we believed we
can grow, and prosper,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and do amazing things
without working hard?

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
But by working smart.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.590 align:middle line:90%
By getting out of our own way.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.780 align:middle line:90%
By letting go.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Because it's paradoxical.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think that to be
successful, you don't let go.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.757 align:middle line:90%
That's like surrendering.

So, for the heart, for example,
the heart mantra is simply ahh.

gratitude, appreciation,
forgiveness.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%

A lot of people

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, that poise,
that presence, that quarterback

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
walking up the line of
scrimmage is freaking out.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:90%
We're freaking out.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And now with the
law of attraction,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.136 align:middle line:84%
we're drawing more tension,
more stress into our lives

00:31:47.136 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
without even being aware
that we're doing it.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
sets up the culture

00:31:50.595 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of the entire organization
you're going into.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.345 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And we find
what we're looking for.

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:56.511 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking for
things to be stressed about,

00:31:56.511 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:90%
they're everywhere.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.932 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean you traveling
and your flight delays

00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:03.015 align:middle line:84%
and everything, do you
just roll with all of that?

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
You just handle all that?

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.615 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, just
a couple weeks ago

00:32:05.615 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I had a flight from Grand
Rapids, Michigan to Newark.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.674 align:middle line:90%
It's a 90 minutes flight direct.

00:32:10.674 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:90%
I had a direct flight.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.436 align:middle line:90%
It took me 30 hours.

00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So I got lots of practice.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Definitely could've
driven there faster.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I could have flown
to Australia and back, I think.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
some of the techniques

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.616 align:middle line:84%
that you use when you
go into the environment.

00:32:23.616 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Something a technique
that you call kaizen.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:90%
What is kaizen?

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Kaizen
is a Japanese word.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It's actually two core words
made into one in Japan.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Kai, K-A-I, Which means to
take apart and make new.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.779 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And Zen, which--
Zen means think good.

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, think positive.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.486 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it?

00:32:43.486 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Be positive.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Be optimistic.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Be present and joyful.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And balanced, well being.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So kaizen is to take
apart and make better.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Make good.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Make good change.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So in loose terms, it
means make good change.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:90%
So we run kaizen events.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just ran one this
week in Los Angeles area.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Where in an event, we
pull a team together.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've identified a
process that needs change.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to take this from
12 weeks down to 12 hours,

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and we need to strip out all
the waste and inefficiency

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.100 align:middle line:90%
and unnecessary variation.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So in a kaizen event,
we get done more

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in three or four or
five days than companies

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
take a year, two years, in
some cases seven years to do.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just
really focus in on that?

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you teach them to do in your
absence, and when you move on,

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:84%
do the companies ever revert
back to those old habits?

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Or do you stay on with them?

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Or do they really learn how
to do the change themselves?

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, well, we
use a model that requires us

00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:84%
at the last step of the
model is to design it

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
into the organization structure
and policy and procedure,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:90%
and that's governance.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
But I always say governance
is not that necessary

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
when people really, truly
believe and experience

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:90%
that it's better.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So think about this,
if you make a change

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.535 align:middle line:90%
where it's truly better--

00:34:22.535 --> 00:34:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't go back?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I don't want to
go back to floppy disks.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.461 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: You know?

00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:30.539 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go back to--

00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:84%
--some of the things that
were just a nuisance years ago

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:90%
because we've made them better.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We've created new
habits now around them.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go back.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's a
great question, Lisa,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
because the sustainability
is a key piece.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:90%
If we don't--

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: --if we don't
lock it in so to speak.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.071 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then it
doesn't really, yeah.

00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Then you haven't done your
job unless it does last.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.815 align:middle line:84%
And you also taught me
to ask why five times.

00:34:56.815 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And explain why that is.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.832 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:59.832 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Why ask why five times?

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, it's
another technique

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.817 align:middle line:84%
that came out of
Toyota, actually.

00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It's called the five whys.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think I give a couple
of examples in the book,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:84%
but the five whys get
us to a true root cause.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.567 align:middle line:84%
And the problem we
see in business,

00:35:16.567 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:84%
we see it in health
care, we see it all over

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
is that we really don't
get to root cause.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.835 align:middle line:84%
We don't really get
to true knowledge.

00:35:22.835 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: We suffer by solving
problems at the symptom level.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you know,
someone's got a headache.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, take an aspirin.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't really
solve the problem, especially

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.623 align:middle line:84%
if the headache comes back
the next day and the next day

00:35:39.623 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:90%
and the next day.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: We had no knowledge.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:90%
We just think we do.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:90%
So why do you have a headache?

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That's one level of why.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.716 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:54.532 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Your
circulation is off.

00:35:54.532 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so the bloodflow
to your brain is off.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is that, second level,
why is that happening?

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
There's inflammation
in your neck.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, why do you have
inflammation in your neck?

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
favoring one side.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Why are you favoring one side?

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Your hips are misaligned
and you don't even know it.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:90%
So, oh.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and we call this
systems thinking in business.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's cause and
effect isn't as obvious

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:90%
as it may appear.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the doctor and
you say, "I have a headache,"

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor's--
it's your hips.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're like huh?

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, you
have to get there.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.021 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: No, it begins with an
H, but I said head, not hips.

00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, yeah,
but let me explain.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a root cause.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: So systems
thinking is where we really

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:84%
get to true knowledge and
we really solve problems

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:90%
at a more sustainable level.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't use
systems knowledge,

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.590 align:middle line:84%
we end up with what we
often call side effects.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.156 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:55.156 --> 00:36:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The world's full
of side effects.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We fix one problem and we
end up with three more.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Creating
others, yes, yes.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Because we're not
thinking more holistically.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The root
cause of something.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.368 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That's right.

00:37:04.368 --> 00:37:07.029 align:middle line:84%
So the five why's is a brilliant
tool to really drill down to--

00:37:07.029 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The functional reasons.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: --what's
really going on.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you apply the
five whys to your own personal

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.069 align:middle line:84%
struggles in life, you almost
always get to ignorance.

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:90%
You almost always--

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.538 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to the ego, huh?

00:37:18.538 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, but the
fourth level, you get to fear.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you wonder
why you're afraid,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
it's because you
don't know any better.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.777 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to fear.

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's-- I
was going to ask you.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Fear is an illusion.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would the
solution for that be?

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, you
have to figure out

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
how to get past the
ignorance that you have.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.977 align:middle line:84%
This is where faith comes
in many times, you know?

00:37:38.977 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean by ignorance?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.101 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:43.629 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's just
that we don't know.

00:37:43.629 --> 00:37:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what we don't know.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: No, no, but ignorance
drives a lot of illusions.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:90%
It drives assumptions.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: So when we're in
the absence of knowledge

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and true intelligence and
true knowing, what do we do?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.185 align:middle line:90%
We assume.

00:38:03.185 --> 00:38:04.735 align:middle line:90%
Do you think we get it right?

00:38:04.735 --> 00:38:06.460 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times we don't.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:12.236 align:middle line:84%
So I make assumptions about
my relationships or somebody

00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a relationship with.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I make assumptions
about my boss.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I make assumptions about
myself, by the way.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:90%
So I assume I can't do that.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not smart enough.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.142 align:middle line:90%
Or I assume I can't--

00:38:24.142 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like the accident
you have with the lawnmower.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.839 align:middle line:84%
If you were to assume that
the doctors were correct,

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have gotten
to the next level.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.921 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That's exactly right.

00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So one of things I always do
in business and otherwise is

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask people, is that
an assumption or a fact?

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you really know?

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.254 align:middle line:84%
Because that's an
awakening kind of question.

00:38:41.254 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
what do you mean?

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I go, do you know with absolute
certainty that that's true?

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact?

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Because data can
be very misleading.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.930 align:middle line:84%
If we walk out to the beach
and you look at the horizon,

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.050 align:middle line:84%
you could swear
the earth's flat.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.524 align:middle line:84%
People thought
that for centuries.

00:38:59.524 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
know it's true?

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.155 align:middle line:90%
Back to the Byron Katie work.

00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:03.849 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: You could swear
that the Earth is not moving.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel anything moving.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You'd never imagine that,
yeah, well, actually we're

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:84%
going through space at
about 68,000 miles an hour

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and spinning at 1,100.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And we're not flat.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Try that on.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can feel that
every now and then.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: But see, it takes
a different perspective

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:90%
to be aware of that.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:23.951 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Because the
facts suggest no, it's flat

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.957 align:middle line:90%
and it's not moving.

00:39:27.957 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you could
look at something

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:84%
as you see as factual
in the company,

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.369 align:middle line:84%
but it could actually
be an illusion.

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That's exactly right.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And you mentioned Byron Katie.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Byron has said over and over.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.970 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's very
little we know of anything

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:42.595 align:middle line:90%
with certainty.

00:39:42.595 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.147 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: We're
assuming all the time.

00:39:45.147 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's ignorance.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.479 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists
said the ignorance

00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is the worst of the three
kleshas, of the deadly sins,

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:90%
is ignorance.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, forgive them,
they know not what they do.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They were all speaking
about ignorance.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So once we realize, you know
what, I don't know everything.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I might think I do.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Some people act like they do.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't know much of
anything, actually.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are definitely
a business sage.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And more than that.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean your rules about
life and your philosophies

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
apply to everything,
not just business.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can take this
conversation home

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.826 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring it
into your families,

00:40:25.826 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring it
into your personal life,

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring it into
your work environment.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.505 align:middle line:84%
Even as an employee,
nonprofit, everything,

00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:33.919 align:middle line:90%
it would definitely work.

00:40:33.919 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Oh, yeah.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.757 align:middle line:84%
It's made a world of
difference in my life.

00:40:36.757 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
one quick story too.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.673 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a tough,
very tough time in my life,

00:40:40.673 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
just four years ago.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had the opportunity
to go visit the Dalai

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Lama on my 50th birthday.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: The topic
that he was speaking on

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
was the wisdom of emptiness
in the heart sutra.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of
timely and interesting

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:08.180 align:middle line:84%
because, at that time,
I had essentially

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.810 align:middle line:84%
had so many of my
own attachments

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.920 align:middle line:90%
just disappear in front of me.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Such as?

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: My wife of 26 years.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:90%
My family as I knew it.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.270 align:middle line:90%
My home.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I had to let it all go.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom of
emptiness really

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:40.660 align:middle line:84%
means that if we go through
life with a very full bowl,

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:90%
we can take on no more.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: We're overwhelmed.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have to let
go to let flow.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:90%
We got to make space.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Make room.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always use a simple,
silly, little metaphor

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.171 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But I see this in business,
I see it in personal lives

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:84%
all the time, is what I call
the closet space syndrome,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.580 align:middle line:84%
where we just never seem to
have enough closet space, right?

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, have
you considered the fact

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.544 align:middle line:84%
that you've got
22 pairs of shoes

00:42:09.544 --> 00:42:11.210 align:middle line:84%
or you've got all
these things in there?

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you really need all that?

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.606 align:middle line:84%
And we do the same
thing with time.

00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We never seem to
have enough time

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to spend with certain people,
or exercise, or whatever.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's an illusion, too.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.460 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of time.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.840 align:middle line:84%
We all have the same
amount of time in a day.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And there's plenty of space.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, when
we see past the ego

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:84%
which thinks in terms of
scarcity, never enough.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to fight
for what you get.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Beyond scarcity is the
consciousness of abundance.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:44.421 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty for everybody.

00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I ask you a little
bit about that time question?

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.586 align:middle line:90%

and things that you say yes to.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you back that off and
allow that time to happen?

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
That enough time for
everything to happen?

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.484 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: You have to be willing
to say no and set priorities.

00:43:05.484 --> 00:43:06.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's where it starts.

00:43:06.775 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: So it's not
so much time management.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what people call it.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's priority management.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a big difference.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So when our priorities
are straight

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and we're very clear on
what's in and out of scope,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.180 align:middle line:90%
there's plenty of time.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:27.890 align:middle line:84%

>>MURPHY: Yeah,
and that's, again,

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the Zen
practice of balance.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Of rhythm, of harmony,
of what in Japan

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:53.810 align:middle line:84%
we call heijunka, which is
peaceful order, it's grace.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And life should appear graceful.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:58.235 align:middle line:84%
When you watch a great
athlete, you know,

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:90%
you watch the Olympics now--

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: --they're graceful.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: They
make it look easy.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're in the zone.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.017 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It's not easy.

00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Those that are usually--

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: But they
sure make it look easy.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They go beyond and their
bodies, I don't even

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:84%
know how they could
physically do what they do,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%
these athletes.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:15.915 align:middle line:90%
And they're amazing.

00:44:15.915 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, they let
go and they let flow.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And they get
aligned with source energy.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.620 align:middle line:90%
They get aligned with spirit.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.680 align:middle line:90%
They get out of their own way.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.585 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
orchestra in action.

00:44:29.585 --> 00:44:30.211 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:31.043 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that.

00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:33.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the title of your next
book, Let Go and Let Flow.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: That's
actually from a tool

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I developed called
the ring of peace.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:10%
And it's in my
book Beyond Doubt:

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:10%
Four Steps to Inner Peace.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:10%
And those four steps are let
be, let go, let see, let flow.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, I love it.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.321 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:47.321 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that people can
get as much from your book,

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.210 align:middle line:84%
because it seems you going into
an organization would solve

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot, but the book is
going to need to have to do.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.724 align:middle line:10%
Because you could only be
in so many places at once.

00:44:58.724 --> 00:44:59.890 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Well, that's true.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:10%
And I've tried to be in
more places than at once

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.117 align:middle line:10%
by sharing what I can.

00:45:04.117 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Through the book and lectures.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And this.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.279 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:08.279 --> 00:45:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: All right,
well, thank you so much.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Thank you, Lisa.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And I hope that
you enjoyed my interview

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.454 align:middle line:10%
with John Murphy.

00:45:13.454 --> 00:45:15.120 align:middle line:10%
And if you would like
to watch a replay,

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.820 align:middle line:10%
you could to go to Gaiamtv.com.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.
