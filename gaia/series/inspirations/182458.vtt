get into sound healing?

>>LISA: OK.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: All right.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:10%
This story is a story
that happened around 1979

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:10%
in Marshfield,
Massachusetts, which

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:10%
is at the tip of Cape Cod.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing in
a rock and roll band.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I had just come back from
a break with my band.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I strapped on my
guitar, started playing.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
looked out at the audience,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that there
was an ambience of negativity

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:90%
and violence in the audience.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, no question, the alcohol
and the other intoxicants

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that people were imbibing was
helping induce this negativity.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But also, I realized
that the music

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that I was creating at
this particular time

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:90%
was also doing that.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:90%
And I had the thought--

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and mind you, I had been
performing professionally

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
for about 15 years.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
thought at this time,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
what if music could be used
to make people feel better?

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And then about a week
later, that thought just

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
shifted a couple of degrees.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, what if
sound could be used to heal?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%
And my life changed.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Doors opened up.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.923 align:middle line:84%
And here I am now,
talking to you.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it really can.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you been
to a great concert?

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You remember it forever.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
feeling at the end,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:90%
and you just love the music.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.945 align:middle line:90%
It can, for sure.

00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And there
are other ways, as well.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only through music,
which is a concept

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
that what we perceive--

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I like to oftentimes make a
differentiation between music

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and sound.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.075 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to say
we're all sound healers.

00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, when
I say sound healing,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
people think, oh, well,
I'm not a trained vocalist.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not a trained singer
or a trained musician.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I can't use sound for healing.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But everybody can, because
we can all make a sound.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Something as simple as a hum,
for example, or making a tone

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:90%
will do it.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, listening to music

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.035 align:middle line:90%
is also a way of healing.

00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I like that
you differentiate it.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We have our voices, and our
voices are our sound healing

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.467 align:middle line:90%
tools if we choose--

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: They are.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --to use them for that.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, there
are two major ways

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
that sound really can heal us.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The first is through music
or our voice or whatnot,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:84%
but somebody else's voice, and
the sound goes into our ear,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
into our brain, and affects our
heart rate, our respiration,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%
and our nervous system.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.659 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
psychoacoustics.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And the other is
the sound goes into our body,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
goes into us on
a cellular level,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
shifts everything from
the molecules to the DNA.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.602 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
vibroacoustics.

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And that, for
example, is something

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that happens when
we hum or when we

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
work with some of
these instruments,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
like tuning forks or
other types of things.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're both
really effective.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you aware
of any types of studies

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that you use sound
to actually change

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
the structure of molecules
or physical matter?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, here's a quote.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Because people
nowadays perceive that,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
oh, sound healing
is a few years old.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But here's a quote
from "New York

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Times," Science section, 1988.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:90%
February 8, 1988.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
"Sound shaped into
dazzling new tool

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
can make, break, or
rearrange molecular structure

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and levitate objects."

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
This did not come
from "Neofo Daily."

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It literally came from
"The New York Times,"

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and you can google this.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And often, I see just
objects like ping pong balls

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot being levitated
by different sounds.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But people perceive that
perhaps the ancients

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
might have had some real
knowledge with this,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is how the
pyramids or Machu Picchu

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
incredible stone objects

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that were tremendously
heavy, and they didn't

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:90%
seem to have the technology--

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:90%
maybe they did.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.217 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was sound.

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can literally
change the patterns

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.195 align:middle line:84%
because of the frequencies
and the waves of sound.

00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a physical thing.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.332 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:03.453 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: It is
a physical thing.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's real.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it is so potent and
powerful, because on a level--

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
can I take a moment and explain
to you the basic principle

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:90%
about how sound can heal?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So this begins with
the concept of, what is sound?

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Sound is a vibration
that travels as a waveform,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's measured in
cycles per second,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:84%
as are many different
things, including electricity

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And we hear from around 16
of these cycles a second

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:90%
to around 16,000, OK?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But just because we
can't hear something

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
there isn't a sound.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%

>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:10%
In the 1950s, this
German scientist

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Otto
Schumann speculated

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:10%
that there was a frequency,
an electromagnetic frequency,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:10%
between the ionosphere and the
earth itself in that cavity.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And later, in 1960,
a team of scientists

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
proved that there was actually
this Schumann resonance.

told you that we

but it's gone up

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:84%
or it's gone down depending
upon whether there are sunspots,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
whether there's a
lot of lightning

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
on the earth, what
weather conditions are.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:90%
It shifts and changes.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's not static.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, it's really

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
staying at this
particular thing.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
In order for the Schumann
resonance to change,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
we'd either have to
change the speed of light

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:90%
or the diameter of the Earth.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:20.462 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Significant.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Thus far,
that hasn't happened.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.368 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How is that measured?

00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:24.168 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:24.968 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: No.

00:15:24.968 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: I mean, I've read
it, but I've totally forgotten.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, don't
worry about it.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.798 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: So it's all right.

00:15:28.798 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just curious.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I imagine there
is certain technology

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:90%
that it was measured.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.901 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:33.701 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does that relate
to our frequency in the body?

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
very, very much--

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
it's been speculated that a lot
of insects and a lot of animals

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
really resonate very heavily
to this Schumann resonance

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and that, indeed,
of course, people--

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:84%
whether they call it earthing
or grounding, just walking

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the ground and absorbing that
is so healing and so positive.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people
get, shall we say,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
very unattached to the normal,
natural healing frequencies

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth because there's
so many other frequencies being

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:90%
bounced at us.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.673 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, now,
there is, especially.

00:16:17.673 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
When you think
about animals, they

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
can really relate to the
frequency of the Earth.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
on it and in it.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they know when storms are
coming and fires and so forth.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is
this bombardment

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of additional
frequencies that we

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
have had to deal with
in the last 20 years.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
impact our frequency?

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, I mean, I
think that, among other things,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
it's really important to work
with sound and other things,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
including walking in
nature, to be able to--

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Restore it.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Totally.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have actually
created a couple

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
of different sets
of tuning forks

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that work with sound
to bring this Schumann

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
resonance into our field,
which I think is very healing.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And it's not only
me, but a lot of people.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't do
things just by myself.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I try them on other people, and
they give feedback and reports

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I go,
OK, this is right.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
I'll release this.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
So first, I want to ask
you before we do this,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
use the tuning forks

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:90%
and really experience this.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But can we set an
intention beforehand,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.743 align:middle line:90%
like you've mentioned?

00:17:29.743 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Can I tell
another story now?

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:90%
So in 1985-- wow.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.696 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was a while ago.

00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a child of
the Woodstock Nation,

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.715 align:middle line:90%
it was not that long ago.

00:17:43.715 --> 00:17:45.257 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It feels
like just yesterday.

00:17:45.257 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: In 1985, I
went to Leslie University

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:90%
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I created a
master's degree program

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:84%
researching the uses of
sound and music for healing.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I had
probably a collection of papers

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
about yo big which were
different systems that people

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
had used to heal different
organs, different frequencies

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that they'd used to heal
the different organs,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:84%
different mantras
and tones they'd

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
used to resonate the chakras,
the energy centers of the body.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I come from a
family of doctors.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Grandfather, father, and
brother are all medical doctors.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me, too.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.597 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm pretty
scientifically oriented.

00:18:31.597 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, this
is going to be easy.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I began
to arrange this stuff

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and correlate this stuff.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden-- now,
mind you, this was a time ago.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So the computer was using
a DOS operating system.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, OK.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Which basically
was a dark screen

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.225 align:middle line:90%
with amber letters on it.

00:18:53.225 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this
cursor was blinking

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
back and forth as I
came to the realization

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that these different frequencies
didn't align with each other.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.412 align:middle line:84%
You'd have one doctor
using a set of frequencies

00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:84%
for a particular organ
and another doctor

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
using a completely
different set of frequencies

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
for the same organ, yet
they're both claiming success.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
You'd have one
spiritual master who

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
would be using a
mantra for one chakra

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and another spiritual
master using

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
mantra for the same chakra

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps the same mantra
for a different chakra.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
there, Lisa, in a state

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
of intellectual angst
thinking, how can this be?

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.885 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: When I heard
this inner voice--

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I love this inner voice--

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%
when I heard this inner voice.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And the inner voice
said, it is not

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
only the frequency of the
sound that creates the effect.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It is also the intention of
the person making and receiving

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:90%
the sound.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.815 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote down the words,
"frequency plus intent

00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:55.615 align:middle line:90%
equals healing."

00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%
It was blinking on this thing.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, don't we all have different
frequencies as human beings?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.922 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a different
vibration than I do.

00:20:05.922 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll go Woodstock.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
vibe than I do.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Hey, you know,
I spoke to Bruce Lipton

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
We were talking.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.698 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Bruce, what's
the secret to it all?

00:20:17.698 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And he began to sing The
Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations."

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But one of my books,
"The Seven Secrets of Sound

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Healing," has a chapter called,
"We Are All Unique Vibratory

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Beings."

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Makes sense.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.238 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:20:31.238 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And usually, when
I'm teaching a workshop, one

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of the first things I'll
ask is, OK, how many of

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:90%
you are allergic to penicillin?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And between 5% and 20% of the
people will raise their hand.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, OK, if we perceive
that everything in the universe

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is in a state of
vibration and everything,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
therefore, is in a waveform,
then penicillin is ultimately

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:90%
a waveform.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And for 80% to 95% of
you, that waveform is healing.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But for 5% to 20% of you,
that waveform is toxic.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And I say that simply
because whether it's

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
food or aromatherapy or
whatever you're using,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.658 align:middle line:84%
we can't treat
everyone the same way.

00:21:20.658 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't it be wonderful?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:90%
I've never found a magic bullet.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.705 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, but
it is measurable,

00:21:25.705 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:90%
which is fascinating.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.997 align:middle line:84%
So you know when
you find somebody

00:21:27.997 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that you just get along
with and you love their vibe

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.702 align:middle line:84%
and you like their
being, their frequency?

00:21:33.702 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
measurable now, isn't it?

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Well,
what do you say?

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
We're in resonance
with each other.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: I resonate
to that person.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
resonance, I just

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:84%
want to get back
for a moment to one

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of the concepts of how sound
heals on a molecular level, OK?

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
state of vibration,

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:84%
including our body, every
organ, every bone, every tissue.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Every part of our body is
in a state of vibration.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
When we're in health, we
say we're in sound health.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sound mind, sound health
Correct, correct, correct.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So we're like this
incredible orchestra that's

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
playing this wonderful
symphony of the self.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it's wonderful.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's great until
the second violin

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:90%
player loses their sheet music.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:90%
And you go, ah!

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The second violin player
loses their sheet music.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, the entire
string section sounds off.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, the entire
orchestra sounds off.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And this would be akin to, if
you like, a part of our body

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
vibrating out of its natural,
healthy resonant frequency.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It's vibrating out of
ease, out of harmony.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We say it's diseased.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just described
how illness happens.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And the basic,
simple, bottom line

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.135 align:middle line:84%
of using sound as
a healing modality

00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
is, what if we could give
this string player back

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:90%
their sheet music?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
What if we could somehow restore
the correct resonant frequency

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to that part of our body
which is vibrating out

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of its normal, healthy range?

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And bottom line, I like toys.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Humans like toys.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Tuning forks, bowls, et cetera.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But we all have the most
extraordinary healing

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:90%
instrument.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't require
electricity, batteries.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It's user free.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't cost anything.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And the owner's manual,
that's our voice.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our voice.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So we
can all learn to use

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
our voice, such
as a hum or [HUMS]

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and to project it with intent
down to a part of our body

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that is vibrating out of it's
correct resonant frequency.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen
extraordinary things.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.133 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced
extraordinary things.

00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen
extraordinary things

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
happen with the voice along
with tuning forks or any

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's go back
to the book that you have,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
"The Humming Effect."

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And you've actually
determined, along with Andi,

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
that it could actually
increase oxygen. It

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
can reduce cortisol, which means
reducing stress, all sorts of--

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:90%
even create nitric oxide.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Which I love, because
nitric oxide is a vasodilator,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.348 align:middle line:84%
which means that it
allows the blood to--

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More oxygen, yes.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah, and
the blood to go out.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And also enhances
melatonin, which

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
helps us sleep and also is used
for treatment of depression.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.495 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin, which is the
fabulous trust hormone.

00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And
release of endorphins,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
which are those natural
painkillers that happen.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:90%
So just humming can do this.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.883 align:middle line:84%
As my son would say to
me, simple yet effective.

00:24:40.883 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's hear it.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can, give us a
demonstration, because you're

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:90%
a master sound healer.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Right.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:90%
But we can hum together.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
suggest when people do

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:90%
this is simply because people--

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:90%
everybody hums.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hums.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:90%
This is why I wrote the book.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Andi and I were
going, OK, what is

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
a sound that everybody
makes that they

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:90%
don't judge themselves?

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:84%
God bless our TV
shows now that--

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:90%
they have a good voice.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:90%
They have a bad voice.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They have a pitchy
voice and whatnot.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness gracious.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So many people are so, shall we
say, uptight about their voice.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But I really don't know anybody
who judges just themselves

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:90%
when they hum.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm a good hummer.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad hummer.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can hum.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And bottom line, very few
people have consciously hummed.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.505 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING] People are humming.

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
What I suggest is that
they just simply take

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
a couple of deep breaths
and close their eyes

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and then just hum
for maybe five times.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
[HUMMING] And
while they're doing

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that, just become aware of
where the sound is vibrating

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, it'll
be somewhere in the sinus

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:84%
cavity or in the
head or the throat.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Here's one for you.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.232 align:middle line:90%
I just have to do this.

00:26:12.232 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do this
for you, because I

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:14.857 align:middle line:90%
don't want to embarrass you.

00:26:14.857 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to hum, and then
I'm going to pinch my nose.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with me.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know about this.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.637 align:middle line:84%
Most advanced sound
healers don't know

00:26:23.637 --> 00:26:25.720 align:middle line:84%
or didn't know about this
till they read our book.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hum, and then
I'm going to pinch my nose.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:28.106 --> 00:26:28.906 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: [HUMMING] You cannot
hum with your nose pinched.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
doing it properly,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
if your lips are sealed, then
where is the air going to go?

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.377 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of an
interesting phenomena.

00:26:43.377 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all about the
air and the circulation

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.165 align:middle line:84%
and the vocal cords
and everything.

00:26:47.165 --> 00:26:47.965 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Sure.

00:26:47.965 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, what Andi and I found,
actually, it was quite amazing.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:90%
The more we got into humming--

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the first book
that's ever been written

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of humming.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And we figured that,
OK, why is that?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, everybody
figures that they can hum.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But also, we figured, all right,
if we did that first chapter--

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
it's what they call
peer-reviewed information

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
on the medical effects of
sound and particularly humming.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
that we found out

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that there's an advanced
yogic technique called

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:90%
bhramari pranayama.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Sounds pretty cool.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.077 align:middle line:84%
It's blocking your ears, closing
your eyes, and [HUMMING]..

00:27:30.077 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's said to have all
sorts of amazing effects.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of what they
call Shabd Yoga technique where

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
one can basically travel to
higher planes of consciousness.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.133 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, and yet
very, very powerful.

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you
talked about this

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:84%
being the synaptic
connections in the brain.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is the psychosomatic?

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:90%
What is it called?

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.177 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: That would
be psychoacoustics

00:28:00.177 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:90%
with vibroacoustics.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective, this
is a vibroacoustics thing.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:84%
After Lesley University, I
went to another university.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually involved
in a program, a PhD program,

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:90%
on sound as a healing modality.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And unfortunately,
my first book came out.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And it basically became
rather well-known,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
so I basically quit doing
that and went on tour.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But what I was going to be doing
was I even had a term for it.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It was called harmonic
intonation therapy,

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and it was going to be showing
that self-created sounds create

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:84%
new synapses in the
brain to be used

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
for treatment of
strokes, Alzheimer's,

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of other stuff.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm back now.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole chapter on
"The Humming Effect" called

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:84%
"The Humming Hypothesis"
showing that there has been,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.960 align:middle line:90%
now, research with this.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Projects.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.927 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: And it's quite cool.

00:29:02.927 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And there's,
of course, stories.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
People have sent
back stories to us

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
beforehand and then after
reading the book about having

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
had some sort of
disability and humming out

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.338 align:middle line:84%
of the disability,
the brain trauma.

00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's zero
downside in trying it.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so easy.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this, if we can.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
listening and watching,

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.105 align:middle line:84%
set your intention, as well,
and listen to the frequencies

00:29:26.105 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that Jonathan's going to share
with us through the tuning

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:90%
forks.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can maybe
set an intention

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:90%
while we're hearing this.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, this is true.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So would you like
my demonstrating

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.705 align:middle line:84%
the Schumann resonance Gaia
frequency tuning forks in you?

00:29:41.705 --> 00:29:42.505 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It is going to be my
pleasure to do this.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take these
tuning forks over here.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:55.285 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say that these
are two different tuning forks.

00:29:55.285 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.112 align:middle line:84%
We say that 7.83 was
the Schumann resonance.

00:30:01.112 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Schumann
resonance, mm-hmm.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So the
difference between them

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:90%
is 7.83 cycles a second.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is a frequency,
as I mentioned,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that is below our
level of hearing.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we can
perceive the sound as kind

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of like a vibrato or
a "wah-wah" sound.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So if I may, Lisa, I'm going to
ask you to pull your hair back.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Are these different,
slightly different?

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:28.756 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:30:28.756 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're both based upon
a harmonic, which means

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
a geometric multiple of 7.83.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
But they're different by 7.83.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And because they differ by 7.83,
they put out a third tone--

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:84%
this tone and this
tone, and then it's

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:84%
going to put out
a third tone that

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is 7.83, which goes into
our ears and into our brain

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and literally causes
our brain to resonate

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to this frequency, which
means that we can resonate

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Schumann resonance
by listening to the sound.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Gaia frequency.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: The Gaia frequency.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Gaia frequency.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So first, I'm going
to just hit one.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:90%
[RINGING]

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.665 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
bring it to your ear.

00:31:12.665 --> 00:31:13.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And you hear
it's just one tone.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, the other ear, if I may.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:90%
[RINGING]

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Sounds very similar.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice tone.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But now, watch the
magic when I put them together.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you will hear this
all of a sudden vibration

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
or vibrato or beat
frequency between the two.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is, if you like,
the Schumann resonance.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you, as
you listen to it, maybe

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to close your eyes and just take
a breath and set an intention.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.327 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Set an intention.

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Whatever
you would like to.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds great.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Would you mind
pulling your hair back again?

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.628 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Thank you.

00:31:58.628 --> 00:32:01.974 align:middle line:90%
[RINGING]

00:32:01.974 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like being in a dome.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And your
eyes are actually

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:84%
exhibiting what they call
REM, or Rapid Eye Movement,

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.368 align:middle line:84%
which is an
indication that you're

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
going to an altered
state of consciousness.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes instantly.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It instantly takes you up there.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah, because this
is basically the theta brainwave

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
state, which is where a
lot of deep healing occurs.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:90%
So these are very cool.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I really like them.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It felt like
I was in a big dome.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
the spaciousness

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.850 align:middle line:84%
of a big, planetary
type of dome.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Nice.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Connecting to the
energy, the Mother Earth.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1960s, there
was a wonderful scientist

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Itzhak Bentov, who

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:84%
first talked about the
Schumann resonance and the fact

00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that if we could somehow attune
to the Schumann resonance,

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
we could attune to the
energetics of the Earth

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even attune
to the, shall we say,

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
information and consciousness
stored in this Gaia matrix.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.865 align:middle line:84%
Information and
the healing of it.

00:33:14.865 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: And the healing.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, not only to
understand the consciousness,

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.010 align:middle line:84%
but to really restore
the balance again.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this collectively,
it is really, truly so easy.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: It is so easy.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's it.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, how can this relate
to the chakras of the body?

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about that?

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: OK.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:84%
With the chakras
of the body, what

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I did as an experiment-- because
of almost everything that I do

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is sort of an
experiment, because I

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do something
that somebody has done before.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.697 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the innovator in you.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, yeah.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has done it
before, why should I--

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to copy it.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:10%
I want to do something new.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.390 align:middle line:10%
So I thought, OK, let me
do a recording-- actually

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.360 align:middle line:10%
called chakra chants,
which is over here.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the late 1990s.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And it won all sorts of awards.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It has since continued
on winning awards

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
and being a best seller.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But the crazy thing is
that, with it, what I

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:27.179 align:middle line:84%
did was I took about a dozen or
more of the different systems

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:84%
for resonating the chakras
that I was talking about

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:90%
before that didn't line up.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But I put them all
together to see anyway.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:90%
I work with vowel sounds.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:84%
I work with what are
called bij mantras.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I work with different
frequencies.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:84%
I work with all sorts
of different things.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:90%
And I put them together.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems to be
very effective at resonating

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:90%
each of the chakras.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to suggest that
with chakra chants or any sort

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.970 align:middle line:84%
of chakra modality, I believe
we are fluid, resonant beings.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So our frequencies can
shift from day to day

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
depending upon what we've
eaten or how well we've slept

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
or if we're jet lagged or
whatnot, et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So these things can
potentially even change.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's important not to get
too locked into any frequency

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.308 align:middle line:90%
as being the right frequency.

00:35:26.308 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you did
experiment with various ones.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Totally.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.783 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you layer those
tracks on top of each other?

00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes, I did.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:35:34.095 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: And I was really--

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.477 align:middle line:90%
it was an experiment.

00:35:37.477 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It came out.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: I didn't know
what it was going to be like.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was rather symphonic.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could we
actually choose one

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that we could play
to the audience?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I think you may have a little
video of something in--

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: MP3 of it, yes.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: This actually
also has crystal bowls

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:90%
involved in it, as well.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is the energy
of the solar plexus,

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
which, for this one, we use
the keynote of E on a piano.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It's tuned slightly
different, as well as you'll

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
hear my voice chanting
these different things as

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.930 align:middle line:90%
well the bowls.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty soothing.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's really cool.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.270 align:middle line:84%
You can either watch the really
cool graphics and images,

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:84%
or you can just listen to
it with your eyes closed.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.197 align:middle line:90%
Listen up.

00:36:29.197 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:32.690 --> 00:42:48.655 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.655 --> 00:42:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Did you like it?

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:90%
That was really amazing.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that it
transported people.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a way
for people to be

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
able to listen to that
at any time, right?

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, indeed.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a website, which
is HealingSounds.com.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.786 align:middle line:84%
That's "sounds," with an
S at the end of it, .com.

00:43:10.786 --> 00:43:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have a free download
called the "seven-minute chakra

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.260 align:middle line:90%
tune-up" that people can get.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And they can get a
free download of it.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, there are
people who use it every day.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Seven minutes long, one
chakra per minute, going up.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And it's
really, really powerful.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.963 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who do it as part

00:43:33.963 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of their daily practice
of healing, of meditation

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just very, very
grateful that there's

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
been such a positive
response from that.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A chance to
awaken in your body,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or is it something you want
to do before you go to sleep?

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Or both?

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: You could probably
do it when you wake up.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.330 align:middle line:84%
You could probably do
it when you go to sleep.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.700 align:middle line:90%
People do it at all sorts--

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: The only
thing I don't suggest

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you do it when
you're driving in your car.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:43:59.474 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:59.474 --> 00:44:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Right, no, that makes sense.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:84%
You have such a beautiful
dedication to sound.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And did you create something
called World Sound Healing Day?

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So, Lisa,
can I tell you a story?

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're good at that.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So there
is, oftentimes,

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:21.190 align:middle line:84%
with me, when I create a
project, an inner voice that

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.370 align:middle line:84%
suggests that, hey, why don't
you try doing this or that?

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Make some tuning forks
that are slightly out

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, or
work with humming

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.780 align:middle line:84%
as a thing, because
nobody's written

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.060 align:middle line:90%
a book on humming before.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Or do this, or do that.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:40.084 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in deep
meditation one day.

00:44:40.084 --> 00:44:43.288 align:middle line:90%
And this inner voice says, OK--

00:44:43.288 --> 00:44:44.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if they said "OK."

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.350 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you have spent
the last 20 years bringing

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:84%
awareness of how people can
use sound to heal themselves

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:90%
on a personal level.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And you've done an adequate job.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They might have even
said "very good."

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Apparently.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:84%
On the 100 most influential
people list, yes.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But
they said, now, it

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:17.860 align:middle line:84%
is time for you to incorporate
using sound to heal the planet.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, wow, that
sounds really cool.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.530 align:middle line:90%
My transmission was shut off.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's it.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Go with that.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Right.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So I had to figure
out what to do.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:90%
How can you heal the planet?

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, what if we
got a whole bunch of people

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:90%
throughout the planet?

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And what if we had
them make a sound that

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.780 align:middle line:84%
was encoded with the energy
of love and compassion?

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:90%
An entire day like that, right?

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, and
I said, OK, what day

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.080 align:middle line:90%
would I want to choose?

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, how about Valentine's Day?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And how about if we
basically had people

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:11.200 align:middle line:84%
send a sonic valentine
to the planet?

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a couple
steps to this whole thing.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.380 align:middle line:90%
We've had our 17th one now.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are literally
thousands and thousands

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of people in
hundreds of countries

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout the planet
who take part in this.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we have them
make this "ah" sound at--

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A specific time?

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah, oftentimes,
at noon eastern time.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we also
say, or noon your own time

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:90%
or any time that you want.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Here in Boulder, we do an event,
as well, from 5:00 to 6:00,

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:55.750 align:middle line:84%
because as we know, time and
space are merely constructs

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.010 align:middle line:90%
of the less ascended mind.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach higher
consciousness, which I haven't,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.000 align:middle line:84%
incidentally-- but if you
reach higher consciousness,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.390 align:middle line:90%
time and space are illusions.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, we make a
sound encoded with love.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the do.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:84%
There is, as I'm
sure you're aware,

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
a technique, a very
easy technique,

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.800 align:middle line:84%
of causing the heart and the
brain, the brain and the heart,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to go into a state of
coherence, which means

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:90%
that it's vibrating together.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And
when that happens,

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field around
goes anywhere from 50 to 500

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:84%
to some people even perceive
of 5,000 times greater

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.570 align:middle line:90%
than normal.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So my wife, Andi, and I, for
example, will lead people.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have them do this
lovely technique that employs

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.450 align:middle line:90%
visualization and breath.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
them make the sound.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one
of those inner knowings

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that I have not actually
investigated scientifically

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to see, is this true?

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you that sound
amplifies the power of prayer.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.688 align:middle line:84%
Sound amplifiers the
power of meditation.

00:48:17.688 --> 00:48:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: There is a reason
why the different prayers

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:23.297 align:middle line:90%
on our planet are vocalized.

00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:24.097 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:24.097 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They all have sounds related to
them or prayers or words, yes.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Chanted.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:28.683 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Chants, yes.

00:48:28.683 --> 00:48:30.388 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Whispered, spoken.

00:48:30.388 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the voice
connects the frequency

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:90%
of the heart and the mind.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And it helps, also,
focus the intention of it.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have people
throughout the planet--

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All on the same day.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Making this
sound, this "ah" sound,

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.220 align:middle line:90%
the heart-centered sound.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
have some effect.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I will acknowledge,
for example, that one

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.405 align:middle line:84%
of the things that has occurred
was that at one point--

00:49:03.405 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
there's a wonderful thing
called the Global Consciousness

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.252 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And they work with
these random number generators.

00:49:09.252 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And people always says, what
are random number generators?

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.460 align:middle line:90%
They generate random numbers.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no, they don't.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.285 align:middle line:90%
They generate zeros and ones.

00:49:17.285 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I always thought it
was random numbers,

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's just zeros and ones.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.108 align:middle line:84%
And it's as though
you're flipping a coin.

00:49:23.108 --> 00:49:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And you flip a coin
100 times, you're

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:90%
going to get 50 heads, 50 tails.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, 100 times,
this thing will go

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.540 align:middle line:84%
50 ones, 50 zeros
except when there

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.003 align:middle line:90%
are events of high compassion.

00:49:38.003 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
way of describing that.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And then high
excitement, like the Super

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Bowl.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Compassion.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: High compassion.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:51.060 align:middle line:84%
When that occurs, the random
numbers become less random.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to graph or
chart 50 zeros and 50 ones,

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.740 align:middle line:90%
you'd get a straight line.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And they, for example, have
done World Sound Healing Day

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:84%
a few times, and it
looks like Mount Everest.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of interesting.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the scientists
involved in this refuse

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to say-- well this
is interesting.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.350 align:middle line:90%
That's as far as they will get.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But they suggest that
something is going on,

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:84%
but they will not
suggest what it is.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to suggest that
there is some sort of interface

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.340 align:middle line:84%
between our consciousness
and the consciousness

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.450 align:middle line:90%
of our planet.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that
was clear on 9/11,

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.720 align:middle line:84%
where they looked at a random
number generator afterwards.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: That's right.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it had
a significant spike.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.853 align:middle line:84%
And this actually was
a few minutes before,

00:50:38.853 --> 00:50:39.770 align:middle line:90%
which was fascinating.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Totally.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I think, actually, three
or four hours before.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hours.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And it
was interesting.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:52.068 align:middle line:84%
I was actually Boston a
couple of weeks after that.

00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I got a phone
call from a fellow.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're down in
New York, and we're in trauma.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And could you please come down?

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So I flew down.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I taught all these people
from the Metropolitan Opera

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.657 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot how to use
sound as a healing modality.

00:51:07.657 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It's so interesting.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So I spoke to him last night.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.930 align:middle line:90%
He's still into doing this.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're speculating on
doing a World Sound Healing

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:22.613 align:middle line:84%
Day that is literally happening
on video throughout the day.

00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:24.029 align:middle line:84%
What a lovely thing
that would be.

00:51:24.029 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this happens
frequently-- well,

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.950 align:middle line:84%
World Sound Healing
Day is every year.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:30.750 align:middle line:90%
You have a chance.

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's Valentine's
Day in the US.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can transmit
this beautiful sound

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and get into harmony with the
earth and with the people on it

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and transmit healing
and receive healing.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a beautiful idea.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: It's interesting.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.040 align:middle line:84%
My friend was
suggesting-- he said,

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe you don't want to
do it on Valentine's Day,

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:54.890 align:middle line:84%
because so many people are
involved in doing other things.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
interesting, too,

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is that on Valentine's
Day, there's a lot of love.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot
of sadness from people

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.850 align:middle line:90%
who don't have partners.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Or loved ones who
have passed on.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Maybe
you want to choose

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.280 align:middle line:90%
a date that is less charged.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, well I'll
think about it.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was an
interesting concept.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I love it.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I love it on that day,
because it gives us

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.785 align:middle line:84%
a chance to not only
focus love on each other--

00:52:18.785 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:84%
which should happen
all the time,

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:84%
not just on one
day of the year--

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.100 align:middle line:84%
but to also focus on
the love in the planet.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were
involved with the project

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:30.070 align:middle line:84%
with Gregg Braden called
"The Divine Name."

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is a very
sacred project, I'm aware.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I would love
to hear your experience

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:90%
about the divine name.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Lisa, are you
ready for another story?

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Apparently, we are, yes.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.470 align:middle line:90%
You have great stories.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: So, in the 1990s--

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
the exact day now.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.263 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I actually
can remember a--

00:52:56.263 --> 00:52:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Specific, yes.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: --specific
day for something.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.450 align:middle line:90%
But this was happening.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I had just attended a
sound healing symposium.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was sleeping on the couch
of my dear friends, Don Beaman

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and Sarah Benson, who were great
megases of sound and the arts.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:90%
They're no longer on the planet.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But I was awakening
from this dream.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:28.110 align:middle line:84%
This voice said to
me, would you please

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:31.505 align:middle line:84%
sound the chakras going
from your crown to your root

00:53:31.505 --> 00:53:32.468 align:middle line:90%
and back up?

00:53:32.468 --> 00:53:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I may have
mentioned, I can tell you

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the date on this one, which
was March 21, 1986 I first

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.430 align:middle line:84%
got this system
vowel sounds that I

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:90%
used to go up the chakras.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And they've almost
universally been accepted,

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.240 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.013 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:53:54.013 --> 00:53:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But I'd
always been going up,

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:90%
so I'd never gone from here.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.695 align:middle line:84%
So I literally had
to write it down.

00:53:58.695 --> 00:54:02.402 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And reverse it.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.902 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And then
I made the sound.

00:54:04.902 --> 00:54:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Two things happened.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
The first thing was
that, of course,

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.785 align:middle line:84%
the energy went from the top of
my head to the base of my spine

00:54:14.785 --> 00:54:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and then back up again.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But also, I heard a
sound that sounded

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.450 align:middle line:84%
like this ancient, supposedly
personal sacred name

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of the divine that had been
given to Moses on Mount Sinai

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and had literally been
banned from the Bible.

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, have I
rediscovered the sacred sound?

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or tapped into it, yes.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:43.222 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:54:43.222 --> 00:54:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And so what did I do?

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Nothing at all, because it
was just too frequent for me.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Too much?

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: It was too much.

00:54:49.105 --> 00:54:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I don't want
this responsibility.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And then Gregg Braden,
who's a friend of mine,

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.740 align:middle line:84%
was having dinner with my
wife, Andi, and I, and I said--

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we had attended
a lecture of his,

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking about the god
code, the sacred name of god.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, Gregg, I think
I've actually discovered

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:10.450 align:middle line:90%
the sound of this name.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would you
have a recording of it?

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:15.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:20.377 align:middle line:84%
I said, but I will record
it for you if you promise

00:55:20.377 --> 00:55:21.460 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that nobody--

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.985 align:middle line:90%


00:55:23.985 --> 00:55:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and you can use
it for workshops,

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.160 align:middle line:90%
but nobody records it.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no problem.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my
studio, and I did

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.470 align:middle line:84%
this recording of the
divine name, which

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:35.832 align:middle line:90%
is very, very powerful.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was the frequency
of your voice with the chakras

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:39.845 align:middle line:90%
from the top down.

00:55:39.845 --> 00:55:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Going back and down.

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to do
it now, just because I

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.960 align:middle line:84%
like to, if you like,
do it only under really

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.732 align:middle line:90%
sacred circumstance.

00:55:51.732 --> 00:55:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, of course.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But what had happened
was I gave him this recording,

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and he played it in workshops.

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And people were having
extraordinary experiences--

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.497 align:middle line:84%
healings, deep meditations,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:05.497 --> 00:56:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But I guess somebody might have
had one of those little pocket

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.790 align:middle line:90%
recorders, and they recorded it.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it was on the internet.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him, hm.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if it's
on the internet now,

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:23.020 align:middle line:84%
the least I can do is make the
best, highest quality recording

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.430 align:middle line:90%
of the divine name, which I did.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I ultimately--

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.960 align:middle line:84%
a few years later,
this inner voice said,

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.080 align:middle line:84%
we now want you to
start teaching people

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.350 align:middle line:84%
how to make this sound and to
write a book called "The Divine

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Name" so that people
can ultimately

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.780 align:middle line:84%
use it to bring themselves to
higher levels of consciousness.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well it, sounds
like it was to be shared.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:50.170 align:middle line:84%
If it came through to you
and just to be held with you

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.420 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't really make sense
for the planet to really heal.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It would need to be shared.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
interesting about this

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:06.550 align:middle line:84%
is that even though it's said to
be the name that Moses received

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:10.390 align:middle line:84%
from the burning bush--
and the first thing

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that the burning bush
says is, I am that I am.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But then it goes on to
say, my name is and--

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.280 align:middle line:84%
spelled out in Hebrew
is yod, he, waw, he.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is the name I
am meant to be remembered

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.560 align:middle line:90%
from generation to generation.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, goodness gracious,
what an extraordinary thing.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's also a purely--

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So here's where I knew I
was really onto something

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:37.330 align:middle line:90%
is I'd made vowel sounds.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:42.747 align:middle line:84%
But Hebrew is, by itself,
a language of consonants.

00:57:42.747 --> 00:57:44.873 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:57:44.873 --> 00:57:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: So I figured
I must have just

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.630 align:middle line:84%
been imagining the whole
thing till I bought myself

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:84%
a book on teaching
yourself biblical Hebrew,

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.520 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not very good
with other languages.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I was fine with
the first chapter.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.588 align:middle line:84%
I was fine with
the second chapter.

00:57:58.588 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The third chapter was
like, the use of the vowel

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.690 align:middle line:90%
sounds in ancient Hebrew.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, in
ancient Hebrew,

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:14.502 align:middle line:84%
the yod, the he, and the
waw were vowel sounds.

00:58:14.502 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
used in this context--

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and it was the exact same sound.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That you experienced.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.547 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
my goodness gracious.

00:58:23.547 --> 00:58:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I love to have, if
you like, 3D backup of what's

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:28.730 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.945 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I have
a good imagination.

00:58:30.945 --> 00:58:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
a beautiful story.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We do have this video
to share with you.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But before we play
this, I'd like

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.830 align:middle line:84%
you to explain what
people can do in order

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:46.423 align:middle line:84%
to embody or respect the
resonance of the sound.

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Well, the
first thing I want to say

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:52.648 align:middle line:84%
is that because
vowels are universal,

00:58:52.648 --> 00:58:57.790 align:middle line:84%
this is not related simply
to the Abrahamic traditions

00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:02.900 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity,
Islam, and Judaism.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It's global.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I've had
people from all sorts

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.550 align:middle line:84%
of different traditions,
from the Hindu tradition

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to the Native
American, going, yeah,

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.780 align:middle line:84%
we work with this
sound, et cetera.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, just
breathe in the energy of that.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If you can, feel the sound
going from the top of your head

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to the base your
spine and back up.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:32.255 align:middle line:84%
And visualize connecting
with the divine.

00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:34.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like to
call it the divine name.

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it a
hotline to the divine.

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Real quick, before
we listen to it--

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:42.940 align:middle line:84%
so a question is,
why did it disappear?

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.157 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: And in my book, I
have a whole chapter on that.

00:59:46.157 --> 00:59:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a whole line
of thought about the fact

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that it was such
a powerful sound

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that the political priestcraft
decided that they weren't

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:58.180 align:middle line:90%
needed if people had the sound.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.100 align:middle line:90%
So they took it away.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it's
a direct link to god.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It can be a
direct link to god.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:05.325 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: It can be.

01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's beautiful, rather
than going through anyone.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand
that this frequency

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.150 align:middle line:90%
isn't owned by any one person.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It was never meant to be.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the word of
god is very sacred.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And your connection and your
individual experience with this

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.630 align:middle line:90%
is what matters.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So just ground yourself
and center yourself

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:27.429 align:middle line:84%
and close your eyes
and take this in.

allowing us to share that.

>>GOLDMAN: Oh, thank you, Lisa.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to suggest
that there are these things.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
My first book was called
"Healing Sounds," subtitled

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
"The Power of Harmonics."

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And harmonics are, if you
like, geometric multiples

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:49.370 align:middle line:90%
of sounds that are created.

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we hear a sound, we're
not actually hearing one sound.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We're hearing a composite
of different frequencies,

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
much as when you take
a prism and you hold it

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
into white light.

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It breaks it into the whole,
if you like, Roy G. Biv--

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a rainbow.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: --rainbow spectrum.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, just the same way,
there are, if you like--

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.020 align:middle line:84%
with each vowel sound,
there are harmonics.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are harmonics that are
most stressed, or pronounced,

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.730 align:middle line:90%
called formants.

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So when people heard
that, they probably

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
heard these very strange other
sounds, maybe hearing something

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
like a flute or
something like that.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
That was actually my voice
creating these harmonics.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.392 align:middle line:90%

you could share this,

01:05:56.988 --> 01:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We're back in the '80s.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:58.550 --> 01:05:59.422 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: We are.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've been in
the '80s this whole time.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Right.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.790 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
A lot happened in the '80s.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Gyume monks came
to the United States

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.100 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And we recorded them in
this recording studio

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.130 align:middle line:90%
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:25.550 align:middle line:90%
And they did this very deep--

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
we sometimes called it a
growl tone or an undertone.

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And I took my recording
of it, which was

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
done on cassette at the time.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went in to my
crystal grid at home,

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
which is, shall we say, a little
chamber filled with crystals.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And I went to sleep with them.

01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:51.223 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next
morning, went [DEEP GROWL]..

01:06:51.223 --> 01:06:57.640 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can just
access that at any time?

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
very, very crazy,

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's said to take
the Tibetan monks sometimes

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.783 align:middle line:90%
years to learn.

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can
recall it instantly.

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
What is this crystal
grid you're speaking of?

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: Oh, that's-- crystals
are a whole other topic that I

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:15.920 align:middle line:90%
worked with.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Have been working and
worked with crystals

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:19.020 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
very cool things is

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that crystals amplify the
power of sound, as well.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And in one of my
books, I have a couple

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of chapters on crystal singing,
which is another topic.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: But first, I
want to tell you a story.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.825 align:middle line:84%
So I had this experience,
and so did the fellow

01:07:39.825 --> 01:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
that I recorded the monks with.

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, the
monks came back from tour.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They came back to us in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Rinpoche, the
head of the monastery,

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and his interpreter came in.

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.062 align:middle line:84%
And this fellow and
I went, [DEEP GROWL]..

01:08:01.062 --> 01:08:04.520 align:middle line:90%


01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Rinpoche says
something in Tibetan

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:08.600 align:middle line:90%
through his translator.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And his translator says,
Rinpoche say, best in west.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.740 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.540 align:middle line:90%
So you really embodied--

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.915 align:middle line:84%
because of your true, beautiful
relationship with sound

01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and the way that you
honor and know how

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
to work with sound and
all of its frequencies,

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
it came through you in
such a wonderful way,

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.420 align:middle line:84%
as did the dolphin
sound through the bowls.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: And I have a--

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:35.899 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Thank you.

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
A dear friend who's passed
on named Don Campbell,

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.609 align:middle line:84%
who wrote many books,
including "The Mozart Effect."

01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember, one time,
Don and I were together.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And I told him this
story, and I did that.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ah,
that's an example

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic transmission.

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's that?

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.569 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's a transmission
occurring through sound.

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:59.609 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
when I teach people,

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I really trust that I'm going to
be able to transmit a harmonic

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.819 align:middle line:84%
transmission, giving
them some of what I have

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
so they can, if you
like, empower others

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
extraordinary ability of sound

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.670 align:middle line:90%
to heal and transform.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the word.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I so appreciate you
being a steward of sound,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.390 align:middle line:90%
as well as Don Campbell.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Amazing, with "The
Mozart Effect" and what

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.819 align:middle line:84%
he did for children
and learning.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:30.814 align:middle line:90%
Certain ones of you are real--

01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:32.939 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: He also introduced
my wife, Andi, to me.

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:33.189 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.729 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, he did?

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:34.529 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yes.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's wonderful.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.760 align:middle line:90%
That is wonderful.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.149 align:middle line:90%
I was not aware that he passed.

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:41.149 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDMAN: Yeah, he did.

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.816 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I interviewed
him, and he really

01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:45.149 align:middle line:90%
made a beautiful impact on me.

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for honoring
Don Campbell and for you.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.562 align:middle line:90%
You are both stewards of sound.

01:09:49.562 --> 01:09:50.520 align:middle line:90%

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You hold the torch
for sound to be

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
honored to us, the lay people of
sound that just experience it.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much for this.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
This has been a wonderful
interview and experience.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: I would like
to suggest that everyone,

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
everyone, is a sound healer.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone
can learn to use

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
their voice on some level or
Tibetan bowls or tuning forks

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.010 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They can learn to use
and experience it.

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that, it's
like you're opening up

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.080 align:middle line:90%
your senses to a higher level.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.217 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
you get a superpower.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.490 align:middle line:90%
We'll take it.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I ask my guests, and
you have already answered this.

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But what is your biggest
why, your biggest

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:37.010 align:middle line:90%
reason that you do all you do?

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDMAN: My biggest why is,
why can't we all get along?

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have to be in
competition as opposed

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.860 align:middle line:90%
to cooperation?

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why we do World Sound Healing

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we be
compassionate to each other?

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:56.400 align:middle line:10%
We have created some fairly
intense problems on this planet

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.200 align:middle line:10%
at this point.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.560 align:middle line:10%
But by working together, that
which we created, we can fix.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.707 align:middle line:84%
And so I wonder, why
haven't we done this yet?
