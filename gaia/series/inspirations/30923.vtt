>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:25.275 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of weight
loss programs out there,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and many of them don't
work, quite frankly.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It's proven because
50% of people

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:10%
gain their weight
back after most diets.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%
You know this if this is you.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And people actually lose
weight, and then they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
put more on when they
go off of their diet.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So could you imagine
what your life would

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
look like if you actually
stopped spending so much time

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and energy focusing
on your weight?

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.915 align:middle line:10%
Well, joining me is
Colette Baron-Reid,

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:10%
an internationally renowned
intuitive counselor

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:10%
whose latest book
is called "Weight

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:10%
Loss for People
Who Feel Too Much."

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot more than
weight loss in this book.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:10%
It's for anyone who feels
energy and basically takes

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:10%
on the weight of the world.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.686 align:middle line:84%
>>COLETTE BARON-REID:
Thanks Lisa.

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting to be here
this early in the morning.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.653 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:14.236 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.334 align:middle line:84%
And it's so great to have
you in front of me in person.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.185 align:middle line:84%
So you have been an intuitive
your whole life, right?

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I have.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:10%
And actually,
that's what actually

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:10%
segued into writing the book,
because of my experience.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:10%
And I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:10%
But I've worked as an intuitive
counselor for 23 years.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.049 align:middle line:10%
And I found my ability when
I was a really small child.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call it an
ability rather than a gift,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
because it was
something that I just

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.547 align:middle line:84%
think it's an aptitude
that some of us have.

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I like that, because it
doesn't make it exclusive just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.424 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have gifts,
but a lot more have abilities.

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Exactly.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's also less precious,
if you will, right?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Or special.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a kid,
the first experience I

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
had with not knowing
where I ended

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and others begin-- which is
what my book's about actually,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Empathy overload-- was
when I was a small child.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:90%
And it came to me in dreams.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So my experience
of overconnecting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.785 align:middle line:84%
was shown to me in a
series of nightmares

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that I used to have between
the ages of three and five

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.825 align:middle line:84%
when I would dream about
the same scenario over

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I would see very
skeletal looking

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
man crying at a table with
a pile of teeth on one side

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.047 align:middle line:84%
and a pile of metal on the
other, like gold or whatever.

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew they were teeth
because I had started

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.282 align:middle line:90%
losing my teeth at that point.

00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:33.566 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Because
I mean, your three.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is that?

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And then
the same man or men

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
like him being shoved into
a burning Easy Bake Oven.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's what I thought
it was because you translate

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.647 align:middle line:84%
your experience, right, to
what you see in your home.

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen
anything like this.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I saw body parts and
a very horrible smell.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.024 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is, I had that
experience over two years.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
My mother would not want to
pick me up when that happened.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the only dream when
I would tell her the dream,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:90%
she act-- tensed up.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And a little kid knows that
because we aren't separated.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.065 align:middle line:84%
Our sensitivity is very much
connected to our caregiver,

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.705 align:middle line:84%
So 20 years later, and my
mom had too much to drink,

00:03:14.705 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I was wearing a cross
she had bought me

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:90%
because I was raised Anglican.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Christian, we were
raised Christians.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was wearing
this beautiful cross

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.735 align:middle line:90%
she had bought me in Berlin.

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It was Russian, right?

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And she just looked at
it and said, take it off.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
And I went, why?

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.594 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I want you
to take that off.

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Because, she said, you're a Jew.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
And I went, what?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And she told me then, you
know that dream you had?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And she told me my grandfather
was killed in Dachau.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:90%
He was a Parisian Jew.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And the dream I was having
was my mother's experience

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
in Berlin during the war where
she picked up body parts.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather was killed
in a concentration camp.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And we were actually Jews.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's chilling.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.799 align:middle line:90%
That's chilling.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Wait.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.736 align:middle line:90%
But the best part was the teeth.

00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:01.324 align:middle line:90%
OK, wait.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the Easy Bake
Oven was of course

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
my way of translating the gas,
the ovens, burning, right?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And the teeth, well, it was
very common for SS officers

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to pull the teeth of the
people they were going to gas.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My God.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And in order to
make trinkets for their wives

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and girlfriends, they
turned it into jewelery.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.604 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very
specific indication that--

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did not know that.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.211 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
did not know this.

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yes.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.019 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very common--
so here's the bottom line.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We turned this into something
a little bit better as we went,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.493 align:middle line:90%
but not really.

00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It took a while.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, so I'm
getting lost in this vision

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:90%
that you had.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot
to handle at three.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, three to five.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Still.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: We
don't know what it is.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Still.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.184 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
terrifying at that age.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So I want to
thread this a little bit.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.485 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was terrifying.

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Like all my other dreams
that were terrifying

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:90%
were terrifying.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go into that
concept of empathy overload,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
when you feel too much
of the environment.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Most intuitive
people-- and actually,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
most of the population
right now are

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
being invited into
that hypervigilance

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
through things like social
media and the onslaught

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.196 align:middle line:84%
of information in the
communication age.

00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really does just
connect us through the wires.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It connects
and disconnects us

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I'll
segue back into a little bit

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
later when I explain the book,
because from an early age, when

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.719 align:middle line:84%
I did not want anybody to touch
me either was interesting,

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
because I would want to
put something in my mouth

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.259 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd seriously, I'd would even
pick up my dog's dog biscuits

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and stick it in my mouth if
somebody got too close to me.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So I used food to ground
myself from when I was a kid.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.639 align:middle line:84%
So I look back on that going,
oh, that's interesting.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because it
was dense and it--

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.829 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: And physical.

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't know
that you were that impacted.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.286 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh my God, no.

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know what to
call that until recently.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.745 align:middle line:84%
The experience is
the experience,

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have anybody
telling you what it is.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So moving through life,
I had many experiences

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
like that where I would not know
where I ended and you began.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the knowing that I
had about your information

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:90%
was just available to me.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, you've
just told me or I just knew it.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And it would be a constant
sense of, how did I know that?

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know that?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Too much information
at the same time, yes.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Because you get everything.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.542 align:middle line:84%
You get the dark, the
light, the past, the future.

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It's
just what it is.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's just available, right?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let me just
talk to you about that.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's just available.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I have all of these
pictures floating around me

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:90%
right now, right?

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can just
pick up and sense whatever

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
it is in my past, future,
problems, stories,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:90%
things like that?

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.631 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It's how I work
actually, interestingly enough.

00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I see pictures and
images and stories.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, I've turned this
into something professional

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that can help other people.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I've honed it.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with it.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I know what it is now.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've set
boundaries around it.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And I've set very
strong boundaries around it.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: But the feeling
piece is something else.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But the information
piece is how I've

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
made my living for
23 years, where

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I will see the threads of
a tapestry of a person.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So what has affected you?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Where did that thread come from?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
How are you making
that pattern today?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you changed
the pattern at all?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
What came into your
life from others?

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
about synchronicities

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and the web of potentiality,
where all of us

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
are somehow interconnected in
this extraordinary, vast sea

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's actually
beautiful the way you

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that you put it, but I'm sure
it didn't read that way to you

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
when you were a
child and a teenager

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't
understand what this was

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and why all this information
was flooding into you.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So that, obviously,
made-- do you

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
think that that ability that
you had to sense and intuit

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
everything around you made
you feel that the smallest

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:90%
things were amplified to you?

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Totally.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And amplified for
me emotionally.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So to counterbalance it,
I developed addictions,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
ways to escape and detour
away from the experience

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I was having that the
world was too much for me.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
So I was bulimic when I was 14.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I went
into adolescence,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
past puberty, when
you are already

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
looking to make these
connections with others

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
adolescence is.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to get away
from your parents

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and have-- even your
sexuality begins.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there's that concept
of connection and fear

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of connection all
at the same time.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I had all this
other stuff to begin with.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So the way I controlled
my world was-- which is,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
bulimia is all about
control, right?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started acting
out with food that way

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
where I would vomit--
binge and purge.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was an interesting
thing, because it

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
was a subject I never wanted
to talk about because it was

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
something that was
very shameful for me,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
but was a companion of all
of this other complexities

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.794 align:middle line:84%
of being an intuitive
and where it led me,

00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of the sense of low
self-worth because I

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what worth I had.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Being a chameleon because you're
constantly tuning in to others,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.815 align:middle line:90%
you're looking to reflect them.

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Plus I'm a water sign, so I'm
always looking to reflect.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.626 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, reflect them
and also, where do I fit?

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And can I fit in here?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You can easily fit in
with anything, anyone,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.477 align:middle line:84%
because you can automatically
mirror and match somebody.

00:09:26.477 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that must have
gotten a little bit confusing.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.295 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Well, it did.

00:09:30.295 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially when
you're an adolescent

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
fit in and figure out

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:90%
where you are in the world.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
never mind that we

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:90%
were the ethnics in the school.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I went to a private
girls' school.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And so fitting in was
not even barely possible.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It was very WASP-y and blonde.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.007 align:middle line:84%
And I had salami sandwiches with
German salami and coarse rye

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
bread, and they had peanut
butter and white bread.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And that was already enough.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
At the lunch table they
would make fun of me.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:90%
So I never quite fit in.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers made
sure that we remembered

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that we were the ethnics
allowed into the school.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very she she fa fa.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
We had the old school WASP
teachers, some of them.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So there was a sense
of social prejudice

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%
that I grew up with too.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then of course my
mom who experienced-- she

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:90%
made these cakes.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:90%
She was a German.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
No one would touch them.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.622 align:middle line:84%
Everybody only wanted
the Canadian cake.

00:10:16.622 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
That didn't look right.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So she would go home from
the bake sale at school

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and no one would touch
what she had created.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So there was always this
symptom of being not part of.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then this made
me too much part of.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So the big thing
happened when I was 19.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I was at university.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.245 align:middle line:84%
And I took a ride home
from a couple guys I knew.

00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I was drunk.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I started having a problem
with drinking also.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just, without
going into too much detail,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I was gang raped.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And what was really,
really painful

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
was two things for me, which
was the vast connectivity

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that I felt in the
experience, because I

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:90%
went into this complete panic.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.991 align:middle line:90%
Left my body.

00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It was like a near
death experience.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Fought only in the
beginning, didn't fight at all.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.579 align:middle line:84%
So of course it took years
for me to get over the fact

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't fight
and they would easily

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
be able to say it wasn't rape.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.126 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Because I just froze.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A very, very
common thing that you said.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.529 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very fine line.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.805 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Protect myself at
all costs, make like a possum

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and go, go ahead and
hurry up and finish.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.426 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
want to get killed.

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:28.217 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:29.027 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:11:29.027 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And these
were guys that could have.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So from there was
very interesting,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because I look back and see what
an extraordinary opportunity

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
that was for me.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
same place I go now.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I can actually go
to the side and up.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The same place where I went
there when I do my readings.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I can disassociate
from myself very,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
very easily when I
look at someone else.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely over
somewhere else.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For somebody who
was as empathic as you

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
are to have that experience-- so
many people watching right now

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
first of all will empathize.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Because as a very
sensitive person,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
it is easy to
desensitize yourself

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
with drugs or
alcohol or whatever

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
because you want to just get
out of that constant feeling.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And many people have had
that experience as well.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.424 align:middle line:90%
But how did you heal yourself?

00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh, yes.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.089 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to that.

00:12:26.089 --> 00:12:27.671 align:middle line:90%
I was going to go there next.

00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Because not right away.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I would love to say that that
was a great spiritual awakening

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
for me and I was just
happy, joyous, and free.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Opportunity?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah, well
the opportunity came later.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I had to
go to bottom after that.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I had tremendous
low self-esteem.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I invited violence and
sexual violence back

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
into my life to
try to find the end

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:90%
of a story in a different way.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty psychotic.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Connected up with someone,
got involved with cocaine.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just say, I always
say, I took the express train

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:90%
to recovery.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So I've been clean and
sober 27 years now.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And my recovery came
and the opportunities

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.344 align:middle line:84%
came once I surrendered and
I had a spiritual awakening.

00:13:08.344 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I had
a spiritual awakening

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:90%
in a drug dealer's basement.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.524 align:middle line:84%
I had not slept or
bathed for a week.

00:13:14.524 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't have a
food problem at that time,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
because of course the drugs took
away the need to eat, right?

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But I had seen myself
as I really was.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:84%
My teeth were loose in
my mouth, my gums bled,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.781 align:middle line:84%
my eyes were yellow
from jaundice.

00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ever expect to talk
about this, but whatever.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:90%
My hair was falling out.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.402 align:middle line:90%
And I went to the bathroom.

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I went up to the stairs, went to
the bathroom, looked at myself,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.014 align:middle line:84%
and for the first
time saw myself

00:13:43.014 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
as I really was and
I just said, help me.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was going to die.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, it was the
most extraordinary moment.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt surrender in every ounce
of my body and God or spirit.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not religious, I'm
a spiritual person because I

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
really believe that God is
in everything, you know?

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's this bubble
that came around me,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and I heard, very
clearly, it's over.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Very clearly.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.529 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you killing
yourself at that moment?

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Absolutely.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I was killing myself.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But I also came
alive in that moment

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
by letting myself completely
go, and I just said, help me.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.639 align:middle line:84%
But not the help me,
get me out of this one.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.936 align:middle line:84%
Like, help me, help
me, I'll get out,

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:30.144 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll go do it again.

00:14:30.144 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
This was like, I
can't go on anymore.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I knew then I
would never have

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to go back there ever again.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
my life would unfold.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I had to drink and
use one more time.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:90%
My dry date's January 2, 1986.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.007 align:middle line:84%
So Christmas and
then New Year's.

00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized
that I couldn't just

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
decide to get well, I had
to really go get help.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a treatment
center for women.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
a spiritual program.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And from that point
on, I committed myself

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to a humble, continuous
self-evaluation

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and a conscious contact
to a higher power.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's how my life unfolded.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.927 align:middle line:84%
And two years later I
certified as an aromatherapist

00:15:14.927 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
while I was waiting
for a record deal.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.375 align:middle line:84%
Because all I ever wanted
to be was a singer.

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.499 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is like, all these
stories come in, right?

00:15:20.499 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But wait, in that moment though,
when you had that bottom level,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
hit bottom moment, you actually
believed that it was possible

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in your body
to be able to live

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:90%
or else you wouldn't have.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I
believed that I-- no.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't believe
that I would live.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I believed that I had no
power, that God had power.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's what I had to say.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
That I gave myself
over to a power.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
That either I was
going to die either,

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
or I was completely without
artifice, completely

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
without ego.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I was completely without
decision making abilities.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I was completely surrendered
and without the sense

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
of the small self that
kept me in my addiction.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Very well put.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: That's
really what it was.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that I
was saying, oh, yippie.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to live.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, but how did you
get out of the basement?

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where did you--

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.701 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: He drove me home.

00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He drove you home.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
I never went back.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You never went back.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And you went to the
center after that.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I
went to the center

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.348 align:middle line:84%
and told them that I
needed to be deprogrammed,

00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:34.344 align:middle line:84%
that I had got an
evil spirit in me.

00:16:34.344 --> 00:16:34.844 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.844 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And they
were like, mm hmm.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.425 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
coming as an in-patient.

00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.028 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And I just
needed to sleep for a month.

00:16:42.028 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what I said.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely-- they
thought I was hilarious.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they
thought I was the one

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.075 align:middle line:84%
person that was
going to make it.

00:16:47.075 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.491 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
They all cried when
I got my 30 days.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my
one year medallion

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and when I got my
one year recovery,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
all my counselors were there.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And on the 20th anniversary
of my 20th year,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the 20th year
that they were--

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:90%
I was 20 years clean and sober.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And when the center
was 20 years old

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:84%
with the Minister of
Health Canada came,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I spoke at their 20
year anniversary.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It was just the most
extraordinary thing.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, I can imagine.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I was going to
say, did you ever go back?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.199 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Or it was
the 15 year anniversary.

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.177 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you went back and
you were of service to them.

00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:24.134 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.134 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I went back and did
service every year.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you spoke
as a successful author

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
with best selling books and
record deals and book deals

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.956 align:middle line:84%
and clean and sober
the entire way.

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID:
Well, at that point

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.705 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't gotten the book deal,
but I had the record deal.

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:45.442 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that was an interesting
thing because, you know,

00:17:45.442 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I am not special.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You need to know that
I am not special.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that a magic
fairy came and sprinkled dust

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
on me and said,
now you're special.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I struggled and I
continue to struggle.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:90%
But I made my talents.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I allowed the talents that
I was given to be used.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get my record deal
until I was 40 years old.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.227 align:middle line:84%
And all that time I
was doing readings,

00:18:16.227 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
telling people I
don't really do this.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm really a singer.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.986 align:middle line:84%
And I had clients all over
the world at that point.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Doing
readings, because--

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
29 countries and I'm telling
them I don't really do this.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.067 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, I love what you just said.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I love that you said
that you are not special.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have those same
exact challenges, struggles,

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that
we're going through.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.950 align:middle line:90%
You're human.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if anybody was
to live on a pedestal

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:84%
their entire lives, it
would be impossible.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We've seen so many falls from
grace because people don't

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
understand that it's how
you deal with the day to day

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
challenges and struggles of
life that make you who you are.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.895 align:middle line:84%
And you become a better
person through how

00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
you deal with those
struggles and challenges,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
how you perceive those
struggles and challenges.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.791 align:middle line:84%
So how did you-- now as
I say you're healing,

00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and now that you're
able to talk about all

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
of this with the beautiful
candidly open healed posture,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
how do you now look back
on that and tell somebody

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
who's been through that
where to get started?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well,
radical forgiveness

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:90%
comes after radical acceptance.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And these are these two
things that I talk about.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And because, until I could
accept and really accept

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that I was an addict and
an alcoholic, really--

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.454 align:middle line:84%
and at that point,
too, I was starting

00:19:42.454 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:84%
the empathy and the eating
thing started to come up.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So I was only dealing with
one thing at a time, right?

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.597 align:middle line:84%
And then my parents
died back to back.

00:19:49.597 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:90%
They lost all their money.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
things to experience.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.994 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like life got good.

00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a lot
of horrible things

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:84%
happened after I
got clean and sober.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't go back to
the addiction after that?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:90%
A day at a time.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't easy.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.216 align:middle line:90%
And my parents died paupers.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:90%
My mom had a brain tumor.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
My dad got Alzheimer's
when he lost everything

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in real estate deal.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Millions of dollars.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And my parents became
completely impoverished.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:90%
So we had to deal with that.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So really the grace is
the unmerited gift, right?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe
that grace is something

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that is not to be put
on pedestals with.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
The fall from grace is really
with a fall from humility.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the reminder
of the humility

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of life on life's terms, we can
create our own reality, yes.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But that reality is based on
how we respond, not the fact

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can wiggle our
noses and get what we want.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It's how do we respond
to the challenges

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
as we are moving forward to
manifest the reality that we

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
desire, right?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.814 align:middle line:84%
And that response happens when
you look at it differently.

00:21:00.814 --> 00:21:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Exactly.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.188 align:middle line:84%
You have to look
at it differently.

00:21:03.188 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your perception
of it has to be.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you are
empathizing and feeling

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and the boundaries
are all blurred

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to convince yourself

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to look at it in a different
way, you feel crazy.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you do that?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well,
I don't know if you

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
feel crazy so much
as-- first of all.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.175 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're talking about a
number of different threads,

00:21:25.175 --> 00:21:25.675 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's getting a little
bit of a hairball right now.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.913 align:middle line:84%
We have to make sure we
don't make it all tied up,

00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:30.451 align:middle line:90%
but we can.

00:21:30.451 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: We can separate
them out a little bit

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:90%
to understand it.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling too
much aspect which

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of course led to this
latest book, for example,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
was what I recognized
was an issue.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.972 align:middle line:84%
Because I started having
issues with my weight, OK?

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So with all of this, when
I was doing readings,

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd be going up and
down like an accordion

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and feeling really
terrible about myself.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I gained 85
pounds when my mother died.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to go there.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.857 align:middle line:84%
Because I was doing
readings, trying

00:21:58.857 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to become a singer--
which I had to give up,

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.481 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because it
just wasn't working.

00:22:02.481 --> 00:22:03.214 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
people were calling me

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
for readings from
all over the world,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and I never gave
out a business card.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But I was 138 pounds when
my mother was diagnosed

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:90%
with cancer November the 10th.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.672 align:middle line:84%
And she died February
17, and I was 219 pounds.

00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: That's like--

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A very short
amount of time.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.976 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
I would have had

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to be mainlining entire
cakes in the closet.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the amount of
grief showed up in my body.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So I, like anyone else, went
on bazillions of diets, right?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm going to diet.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And nothing worked.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I gained weight every
time I went on a diet.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So I finally-- it was
an interesting thing.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was when I dropped all
the weight was when I stopped

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
dieting and I decided
to love myself

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:90%
instead of hating myself.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.872 align:middle line:84%
Because there was the
constant barrage of my own

00:22:55.872 --> 00:22:57.455 align:middle line:84%
mind even though I
was clean and sober

00:22:57.455 --> 00:22:59.199 align:middle line:90%
and my life was a miracle.

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
There was still this real
sense of low self-worth

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
because of my weight and
because of the pressure

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.001 align:middle line:90%
to look a certain way, right?

00:23:05.001 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Plus I was trying
to pursue a business where

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.369 align:middle line:84%
it was just not going to
happen when I was, like, giant.

00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In front of the camera?

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.576 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: In front
of-- not any-- come on.

00:23:15.576 --> 00:23:16.577 align:middle line:90%
It was like, 219 pounds.

00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:18.784 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to go out
and be a rock star, right?

00:23:18.784 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Not unless you were
one first and then

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
you got to be one later.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that does not happen.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But it was this sense of
needing to protect myself,

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and the body did exactly
what it was told.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I was unsafe from
my own thoughts.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I went on this fascinating
year of self love.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm not going
to hate myself anymore.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I went to Overeaters Anonymous.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.183 align:middle line:90%
That didn't help me.

00:23:40.183 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I was just like, ugh.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You tried
diets, everything.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh my god.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:90%
You name every diet on the sun.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.977 align:middle line:84%
The Atkins Diet, the
only vegetable diet.

00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
The grapefruit diet.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.503 align:middle line:90%
The egg diet.

00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:49.002 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:49.002 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:50.867 align:middle line:90%
The pills.

00:23:50.867 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't take pills
because I was clean and sober.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:90%
So that was before.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.027 align:middle line:84%
So now it's like,
what can I take

00:23:56.027 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that was over the counter
that wasn't drugs?

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:90%
So it was crazy.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've been
through all of this

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
just to come to realize
that the self love

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:90%
diet was the one that worked.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh, yeah.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.867 align:middle line:84%
Three meals, two
snacks, self love.

00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And I lost all the weight.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And stayed very slim
for a long time.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:90%
So then, here's what's crazy.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to get
back to that in just a second.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:90%
The three meals, the self love.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
main point of the book.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: That's the
main point of the book.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But then--

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: But then-- wait.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:90%
This is the best part.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't even notice.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I just figured-- I
didn't even notice

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I was doing that,
which was crazy.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I knew that that was-- all I
could do was just not diet,

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
love myself, stay sober,
and just surrender

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to what God had put in front
of me, which was my readings.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I studied Jungian
psychology at that point.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I was voraciously snorting every
spiritual book I could get to.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I took meditation, I
went to the Tibetans,

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.212 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Zens who
hit me with a stick,

00:24:48.212 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't like them.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.086 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to the
Tibetans who were nicer.

00:24:51.086 --> 00:24:52.021 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:52.021 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Those were some Zens.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You know
what I'm saying, right?

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't
know about this, people.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So I just completely
immersed myself

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.895 align:middle line:84%
in Louise Hay,
Marianne Williamson,

00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:84%
who are now all
my contemporaries.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.551 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, yes.

00:25:06.551 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And then
wanted to understand

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.705 align:middle line:84%
what was happening to me
when I was doing readings,

00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because I was so clearly
seeing these things.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated,
not with the information,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
but what the people were
doing with their lives,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.672 align:middle line:84%
and why I saw certain
patterns, and what could I do,

00:25:19.672 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and how could I
understand the symbolism,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and what does synchronicity
mean, and blah, blah, blah.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.652 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm sure when
you're able to see intuitively

00:25:29.652 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
the pictures and how they
all line up, then of course

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
curious as to why.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.485 align:middle line:84%
And then people would want
help after that, right?

00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I drove
my parents crazy.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.266 align:middle line:90%
My question was always why?

00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:39.766 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.405 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:25:41.005 --> 00:25:41.505 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Why, why, why?

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.899 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:44.275 align:middle line:84%
Why people do the
things they do.

00:25:44.275 --> 00:25:45.024 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Why?

00:25:45.024 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have to do that.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.986 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:25:46.986 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Why, why, why?

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm right there
with you, sister.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.164 align:middle line:90%
Endless fascination.

00:25:51.164 --> 00:25:51.955 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:25:51.955 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So then what
happens is, OK, at that point

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd given up
completely the music.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
I was like, so not about that.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So I was fascinated
with the chakras.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'd started studying Anodea
Judith's work and Caroline

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Myss.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Anodea Judith wrote "Western
Body, Eastern Mind,"

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and "The Anatomy of the
Spirit" was Caroline.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So I completely
when chakra crazy.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, two very good
people though to study,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
because they're
both very authentic.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Absolutely.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I created "Journey Through
the Chakras," which

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
was the first time anybody
had recorded multi track

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
spiritual CD, you know, like
you would a regular rock album.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And it went to number one in
Canada because I'm Canadian.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And EMI Music picked it
up in these very strange

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:90%
sychronistic series.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I had met Eric Ross, who worked
with Tori Amos on her big break

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.927 align:middle line:90%
out album.

00:26:46.927 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:84%
"Little Earthquakes,"
I think it was called.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And he really developed
her sound, et cetera.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:84%
He did the soundtrack for
this documentary I was in.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:90%
So I approached him.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
EMI picked me up
and said, you know,

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.622 align:middle line:84%
we want you to do another
spiritual kind of chanting CD,

00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
which was what they
were expecting.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:90%
I went to Eric.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And he knew I could sing.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:90%
He goes, we're not doing that.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:90%
We're going to write music.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, we are?

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:90%
So we recorded these songs.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I went back to Canada sweating.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm really
sorry I recorded these songs.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to give you
your money back.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know you wanted me to do
this, like, new age-y thing.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And the president of EMI
Music said, oh my god.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
This is so good.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to
tell anybody who you are.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to send it
around to the A&R department,

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:90%
see what they think.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.043 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody likes it,
we're putting you on a plane.

00:27:31.043 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't, we want
to go back to do what we did.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, OK.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They came back and said,
we're getting you on a plane.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Go back to Los Angeles.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So I recorded, in seven
weeks, I wrote and recorded

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
a whole album with EMI
called "Magdalene's Garden."

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whoa.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.661 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this was infusing
the chakras into music?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: No, that was the
first album that got me there.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
No, this was just
singer songwriter.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It was music that was all
about, interestingly enough,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:84%
it was all about
relationships, but relationship

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:90%
to your spirit.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that other
one ever get produced?

00:28:02.475 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh, yeah.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
It was number one. "Journey
Through the Chakras."

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that was "Journey
Through the Chakras."

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.911 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah, it
was the number one seller.

00:28:07.911 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It still is a
classic seller now.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.185 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: That
was a meditation CD,

00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:90%
so that still sells.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing was,
I tried to quit doing readings,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
but the music business
wasn't for me.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Because
I got what I wanted,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:90%
which was not through that.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I proved to myself
that I could sing.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The business was going
to eat me alive in order

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:90%
for me to stay clean and sober.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And plus, I was already doing
so well as an intuitive.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't about to go
sit in a van with a band

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and go to bar to bar to sing.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't me.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And the CD was up against
Britney Spears and Christina

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Aguilera, and I
sound like Kate Bush.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't do well
anyway, which is fine.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:90%
But I'm very proud of it.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:90%
People love it today.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you said you got
what you wanted out of it.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I
got what I wanted,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
which is to prove to
me that I was talented.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But also, I was chasing
something for those years

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:84%
that I got out of my
recovery and I got out

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
of-- I wanted to feel
good about myself.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to feel like I counted.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought music,
because of course it

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
was quite narcissistic
in the early years.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.923 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to sing
about my life and my pain.

00:29:20.923 --> 00:29:21.422 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:21.422 --> 00:29:21.921 align:middle line:90%
Ah--

00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:90%
[GUITAR SOUND]

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And then in the end, I
didn't need to do that.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I wrote some awesome music.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But I was getting the value
for my life out of my readings.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing it.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I still kind
of tried to quit.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Then W Magazine wrote a whole
full page article about me.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to Hay House
and basically, Reid Tracy,

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.074 align:middle line:84%
who completely changed my life
in one minute, who I love,

00:29:46.074 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
said to me, you can't
serve two masters.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They're going to think
you're a singing psychic.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.501 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:90%

>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
You obviously don't
have a problem talking,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.720 align:middle line:90%
which is great.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were
worried that you

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
were going to have
to fill in, right?

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I wasn't.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really have many,
many different gifts in a way.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.235 align:middle line:90%
And you called them attributes?

00:30:08.235 --> 00:30:09.670 align:middle line:90%
What did you call them?

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Aptitudes.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Or attributes.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, aptitudes.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I've got the gift of gab.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can
talk, you can sing,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:90%
you can read people's lives.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.886 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you come
across, as completely authentic.

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:23.636 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I don't
know how else to be.

00:30:23.636 --> 00:30:24.311 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going
to ask you that.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I'm the
same onstage, offstage,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:90%
on the radio, off the radio.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right here.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.621 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right here.

00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know what I do?

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:10%
I love people.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:10%
I've got to say this, OK?

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.432 align:middle line:10%
I came from a lot of pain.

00:30:36.432 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to live in pain.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a victim.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:10%
I completely see
what happened to me,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:10%
how my addictions
worked into that.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know today that I was
given a second chance at life,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and I am not going
to walk around

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.124 align:middle line:84%
with a great big
rock on my shoulder

00:30:49.124 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because some stuff
happened to me.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have
kids because of it.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.278 align:middle line:84%
I got a serious
illness afterwards.

00:30:53.278 --> 00:30:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.894 align:middle line:84%
I get today that life-- you can
make lemonade out of lemons.

00:30:59.894 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You sure have.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You can, and
I'm not driven by my stories.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's a story,
but it doesn't define me.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It certainly defines
my experience

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.957 align:middle line:84%
so that I know how
to help someone

00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:90%
who's had that experience.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And you start by surrendering
to the truth of what is

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and just recognizing,
this is a story.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's happened to me.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:84%
The people in the Holocaust that
survived and actually thrived

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
afterwards were people who
decided during their internment

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that they would help
their fellows in there.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:37.846 align:middle line:84%
They didn't moan, they shared
their last piece of bread.

00:31:37.846 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
They held a hand of
somebody who was afraid.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what this is about,

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
is about taking your
life story, sharing it

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.465 align:middle line:84%
so that you can help
someone else, you know?

00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And using yourself as a
teaching tool for others.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But to say that
coming from someone

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
who was trying desperately to
fit in because all you could do

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:84%
was see that you were different,
and to get to the place of so

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:84%
much pain because of
that, to come here and be

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.914 align:middle line:84%
in a completely authentic place
in your life, is beautiful.

00:32:07.914 --> 00:32:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And I
still have problems.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
it's like-- but yes.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.645 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a teaching moment.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.243 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: It is.

00:32:13.243 --> 00:32:14.769 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:32:14.769 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this has been a
very interesting conversation

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.143 align:middle line:84%
with you, because it's
been a long time since I've

00:32:19.143 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
been able to talk
about everything.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It's because there's
so much to say.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
have the time here.

00:32:25.365 --> 00:32:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I know.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not, like, getting
10 minutes on a TV show,

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
with like, do a
reading and get off.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.971 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:10%
When someone gives
you some space,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:10%
you get to open up, which
is a wonderful thing.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And you get to see, this
is your life as well.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:10%
But mostly what
you're doing, Colette,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.140 align:middle line:10%
is that you're teaching.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Through what you're
talking about,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.996 align:middle line:10%
the fact that
you're sitting here,

00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:10%
able to even tell these
stories in the neutrality

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.542 align:middle line:10%
that you're able to tell them
is a teaching in and of itself.

00:32:49.542 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: That's
an interesting point

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:90%
when you said in the neutrality.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to fast
forward to recently,

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:10%
because a year ago I started
the Master Intuitive Coach

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:10%
And it came about out of
a system that I created,

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:10%
a method, that I workshopped
for a number of years

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:10%
when I lived in Sedona
with this intensive

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:10%
called the Envision Process.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is all about getting
to a place of neutrality

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.410 align:middle line:84%
when you are assaulted
by your emotions.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Being in the witness place,
that I am space within us where

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
our stories can be
seen just as stories.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can see them in
almost a fairy tale manner.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I call it that
wizard of awareness

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
within each one of us.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually train coaches
to help people get neutral.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Not to get discompassionate
or dissociated.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually to be
able to have compassion

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
some spatial distance

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.504 align:middle line:84%
and perspective on
whatever's going on.

00:33:44.504 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does this belong with
the boundaries conversation?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Definitely.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:47.715 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:47.715 --> 00:33:49.502 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because how
do you get boundaries

00:33:49.502 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
if you were never
raised with them,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't know what
they look like as a child?

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
How do you learn boundaries?

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well, the
word no is a good start.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.441 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a good start.

00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty clear boundary.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.428 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No, no, no, no.

00:33:59.428 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Knowing that
what other people think of you

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.323 align:middle line:84%
is none of your business,
and getting a real sense

00:34:04.323 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
of good self-worth and
self-esteem I think is first.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.997 align:middle line:90%
I'm still working on this.

00:34:08.997 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book about something
that was meaningful to me

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.705 align:middle line:84%
because it was something that
I have to practice on a day

00:34:13.705 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to day basis.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I contend to be a bit
of a people pleaser

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:90%
because I love people.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I want them to be happy.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm like,
hmm, that was not good.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right there with you.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.423 align:middle line:90%

00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:25.914 align:middle line:90%
So I need to work on that one.

00:34:25.914 --> 00:34:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that to recognize
that everything I'm feeling

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
is not always mine.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And just to be able to ask
the question, is this mine?

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Ah, OK.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:90%
What can I-- oh, OK.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not mine.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:90%
So then I can detach from that.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
conscious detachment,

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.600 align:middle line:84%
it goes into this
whole conversation

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.138 align:middle line:84%
also about
co-dependency of where

00:34:48.138 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:84%
you can be interdependent
rather than

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:84%
co-dependent and
unenmeshed from others.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And it takes practice.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.164 align:middle line:90%
You need to know your body.

00:34:55.164 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You need to know
your own signals.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I teach people how to do that.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Salt baths really help,
believe it or not,

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
with boundaries, because
it keeps you contained.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But
conscious detachment.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel yourself
getting too enmeshed

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in a situation or
an environment,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.874 align:middle line:84%
how do you
consciously pull back?

00:35:10.874 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well,
I can give you

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
a quick exercise,
which would be good.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:14.838 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:35:14.838 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
So here's a quick one.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.056 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a
conversation with somebody

00:35:21.056 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling that
it gets really sticky

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
enmeshed with that person,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.775 align:middle line:84%
counting brings you
back into yourself.

00:35:27.775 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Counting all the
different things

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that you see around there,
because it brings you

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
into that analytical mental
state instead of your emotions.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:10%
So if you just go, that's
a plant, that's a table.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a beige carpet.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:90%
There's a stain on the carpet.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:90%
I have nice boots.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
She's got good shoes.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.628 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You
actually just say that.

00:35:43.628 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
You're engaging a different
part of the brain, right?

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
you feel enmeshed,

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
you end up in that--
in the amygdala, right?

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about stress,
because stress and enmeshment

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and lack of boundaries
are all co-related.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.144 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And related
to the weight gain

00:35:59.144 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
as well, because we
started the show that way.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And this whole conversation's
really about that.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole book is
really about that.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.807 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
how we feel too much.

00:36:07.807 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And intuition
can also lead you into that.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Because most people who
are highly intuitive,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:84%
specifically people who are
clairsentient and feel things,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:90%
they're going to feel more.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But the general population,
as I said when we first

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
started this, is being invited
into that hypervigilant state

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:90%
where we don't feel safe.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.352 align:middle line:84%
So that's also a part
of the enmeshment

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
where we want to
feel like, where's

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
our connection or isolation?

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So it goes from one
extreme to another.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Facebook is an
enmeshing experience.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.811 align:middle line:84%
You're always in there,
reacting, et cetera.

00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
How many times do
we go to Starbucks

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.620 align:middle line:90%
and we see somebody like this?

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.332 align:middle line:90%
[TYPING SOUNDS]

00:36:39.332 --> 00:36:40.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, but
it's, as you said,

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:84%
connecting and disconnecting
at the same time.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So the
detached position

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:90%
is the position of the observer.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
All ancient traditions talk
about that observer self,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that self that is higher that
could sit on a ledge and look.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It's making that
decision to go there.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.164 align:middle line:84%
I'll do the little exercise for
your viewers, too, in a second,

00:37:01.164 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
because I think everybody
could do it with us.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.768 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: But I'll give
you the background to it.

00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:08.266 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.266 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So what did I go-- I just
lost my train of thought.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You were talking
about the observer.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But there was the other
thing about neutral and--

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, connection and
disconnection at the same time.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.518 align:middle line:90%
Connection and disconnection.

00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we all
have that lost sense,

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that we want to be
connected but it's

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.550 align:middle line:84%
too much so we
need to disconnect.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And plus our whole society
teaches us to be afraid.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So the brain, which is still
our-- we are physiological.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.440 align:middle line:90%
We're energetic beings.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have organs, and we have
a whole system of information

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.641 align:middle line:84%
going through us that serve us
as the human being that we are,

00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:44.140 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are spiritual
beings having

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.660 align:middle line:90%
a human experience in a body.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But our consciousness
expands outside the body,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:90%
but it goes through it, right?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to
us in enmeshment,

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal cortex or the
part of the brain that's smart

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
goes silent, because the
amygdala or the ancient brain

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
gets awoken because it's
signaled that it's not safe.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So your ability
to make decisions

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
in the enmeshed moments are
actually taken away from you.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening
is that your neuropeptides,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:84%
the molecules of
emotion, then will

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.100 align:middle line:84%
go and speak to the
receptor cells that

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:90%
will release hormones.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy,
you'll get dopamine.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're stressed,
which most of us are,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get the adrenalin.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Now in the old days,
that would signal

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that there was a T.
rex going to chase us.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.140 align:middle line:90%
So we would run really fast.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the stress would
go through our bodies.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And we would need
a lot of glucose

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:84%
because we ask for
glucose, right?

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:90%
So we want to run.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
if we're stuck in a cave,

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:90%
we're in there.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We might be in
there for 30 days,

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
because the T. rex
could wait us out.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So what then happens is
cortisol runs through our body.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:84%
We get something called
visceral fat around our middle.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.071 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
to eat something--

00:39:08.071 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way
to keep us alive.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.255 align:middle line:84%
That's how ancient humans
didn't-- you know what I mean?

00:39:13.255 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Freeze in the winter.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.419 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So for some
of us, for some of us

00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:84%
who are under that
constant low grade

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:84%
stress, when you're
going to gain weight.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.839 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody.

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a lucky part
of the population that

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
goes the opposite
extreme, right?

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.050 align:middle line:90%
So they won't.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.105 align:middle line:84%
And we'll typically use food to
ground ourselves after 4:00 PM.

00:39:33.105 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:90%
So people who are empathic.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:90%
4 o'clock, the bell rings.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't take this anymore.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Give me some food.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you can hold
off for that long.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But also that fat
stores around the middle

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:42.610 align:middle line:90%
because it protects the organs.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Correct.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And visceral fat makes
more visceral fat,

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:84%
so that's why it's
harder to lose weight.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you're telling your
body when you're on a diet--

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.784 align:middle line:84%
and this is for anybody that's
gained weight when they've

00:39:51.784 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
dieted and not just
empathic people-- you're

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.590 align:middle line:90%
telling your body you hate it.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.381 align:middle line:84%
The body's going to
go, we need protection.

00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We need to protect
her from her thoughts.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So you constantly give
yourself more stress.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We're going to starve.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.392 align:middle line:90%
Hold on to what we have.

00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: God, yes.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's not
going to feed us again.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:07.434 align:middle line:90%
Let's hold on.

00:40:07.434 --> 00:40:08.225 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:40:08.225 --> 00:40:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And then, oh boy.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:90%
She's going to feed us now.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:90%
We'd better hold on that, too.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:90%
But not just that.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're trying to starve,
and you're hating your body,

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you notice these
very stick thin women

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.910 align:middle line:84%
with these bloated
bellies, right?

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And you can see that too.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's just fascinating.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And I did all the
studies because it

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.940 align:middle line:90%
was a departure from my work.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
My work was very
psychological and it

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:84%
was about omens and
signs and symbolism

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and Jung and all this stuff.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And my work as an intuitive
is about doing readings,

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and I have a
coaching school now.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So what am I doing
talking about weight loss?

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.332 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was because
I put on 25 pounds

00:40:42.332 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
while I was on tour
with Hay House.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.206 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought
I had it licked.

00:40:45.206 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:90%
I got there.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
While I was looking,
while I was watching,

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.830 align:middle line:90%
I was a vegan vegetarian.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.037 align:middle line:84%
I was being super
clean with my eating.

00:40:53.037 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was making sure I
was eating enough protein.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why I
watched my food so I

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
know I wasn't doing
anything wrong.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I still put on 25 pounds
while I went on tour

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:84%
with Sylvia Browne as her
opening speaker at Hay House.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Terrified of the audience,
terrified of the experience.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Having all these people that
needed something from me,

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.630 align:middle line:84%
not knowing where I
ended and they began.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And I just started swelling.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.589 align:middle line:84%
So that's when it
was like, oh, my god.

00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be, like, a forensic
CSI agent now and figure out

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.914 align:middle line:90%
what this is.

00:41:18.914 --> 00:41:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed how
many overweight people

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.450 align:middle line:84%
were in the audience,
and their stories.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And over the years, wow.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Empathy equals-- people
who feel too much

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.630 align:middle line:84%
equals having
problems with weight.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Just a minute, right?

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Big moment.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Call the news.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Because yeah, it adds on those
cellular pictures and memories

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.365 align:middle line:84%
and padding from the
world and boundary.

00:41:42.365 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
It sets a boundary.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
when I'm overloaded,

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:90%
you'll see it in my face.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.250 align:middle line:90%
I look like a moon.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Which is awful, but anyhow.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.674 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So I went back over
my life, and I went,

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
what did I do when I
lost all that weight?

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, I loved myself.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go on a diet.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I just loved myself.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.395 align:middle line:84%
I watched what I said
to myself about my body.

00:42:00.395 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I started, even if
I didn't believe it,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I pretended to love my body.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.234 align:middle line:84%
And I took these Himalayan
salt baths that I love.

00:42:06.234 --> 00:42:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I stopped taking
my bath all the time,

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:90%
which I used to love.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what
Himalayan salt did.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So I found out after the fact
that it releases negative ions

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and it clears your
electromagnetic field.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wait a second.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So I created this class.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, because
Christmas is always really hard.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:90%
This is two years ago.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.110 align:middle line:84%
For me it's like, as soon as
I know the Christmas tree is

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.336 align:middle line:90%
coming, I'm going to get fat.

00:42:31.336 --> 00:42:32.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it is.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.751 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm expecting
something awful

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:36.256 align:middle line:84%
to happen in my family
any minute now, OK.

00:42:36.256 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, ooh.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's what
had happened in your life.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh, always.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.674 align:middle line:84%
Bad stuff always
happened at Christmas.

00:42:41.674 --> 00:42:44.435 align:middle line:84%
Good stuff at Easter,
bad stuff at Christmas.

00:42:44.435 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is really funny.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.084 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to put on
a class-- basically,

00:42:48.084 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
let's not get fat over Christmas
together was kind of the class.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But I had to call
it something, so I

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.135 align:middle line:84%
called it Weight Loss for
People Who Feel Too Much.

00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I expected maybe
20 people to come.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I did not expect
a lot of people.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.925 align:middle line:84%
I thought, ah, I
can handle this.

00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, over 300-- like 348
people signed up online.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was an online class.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Oh my God.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.739 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was like,
how is this possible?

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, we actually have
a trailer of the book.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.011 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
see it so you can

00:43:11.011 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
get an idea of what the whole
concept around the book,

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:84%
"Weight Loss for People
Who Feel Too Much" is.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.614 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:17.280 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.640 align:middle line:10%
>>Hi, I'm Colette Baron-Reid.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm so thrilled to share my
new book with you, "Weight Loss

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.915 align:middle line:10%
for People Who Feel Too Much."

00:43:23.915 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:10%
I bet you're here because you've
tried everything to lose weight

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:10%
and can't, or if you
have, you haven't

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:10%
been able to keep
it off for a long.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're like me,
this has caused you

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:84%
so much shame,
frustration, and anguish,

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and you wear it for
everyone to see.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I know how it feels.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been like this off
and on my whole life.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:90%
You feel powerless, defeated.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:84%
You stop trusting yourself
and you lose faith.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Deep down you know your
struggles with your weight

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.450 align:middle line:84%
have not been just
about whether you've

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
done the right cleans or
followed the right food

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and exercise program.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.855 align:middle line:90%
You've done that.

00:43:54.855 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:10%
It's got to be something else,
something emotional, something

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:10%
about how you are.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.750 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you are a person
who feels too much.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:06.600 align:middle line:10%
Could it be that your
wonderful sensitivity

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:10%
to the world, your ability to
sense the feelings of others

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:10%
when you walk in a room
or even your ability

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:10%
to sense the emotions of the
world when you turn on the news

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:10%
is the cause of this issue?

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.800 align:middle line:10%
And what about your impulse
to help others, your empathy?

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Could that be a
part of this too?

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:10%
You may be using food as
a way to ground yourself

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:10%
from being overwhelmed by
everything you're tuning into.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Everything you've
been struggling with

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.760 align:middle line:10%
has been a way for you
to cope with feelings

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:10%
that aren't even yours.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.910 align:middle line:10%
Your weight has
served as protection

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:10%
because you don't have a
clear sense of where you end

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and others begin.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.960 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here to tell
you there is hope,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.330 align:middle line:10%
and it's not in a
typical diet book.

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:84%
When I developed the
program in this book,

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:84%
over 2000 students worked with
it in the seminars I provided.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And the successful
testimonials from real people

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.160 align:middle line:90%
were astounding.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I have found something
that works for us where

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:90%
nothing has worked before.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:84%
This book maps
out a program that

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:84%
helps you manage your
emotions, your empathy,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and provides you with
concepts and tools

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to teach you how to release
the weight you've been holding

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
onto, both in your body,
your mind, and your heart.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.390 align:middle line:84%
"Weight Loss for People
Who Feel Too Much"

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
works because you release the
weight from the inside out.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And this book isn't about
being skinny and trying

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to get to unrealistic goals.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.720 align:middle line:84%
You may never be a
size 0, and who cares?

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Your body is brilliant
and intelligent

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and it knows the
right size for you,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:84%
when you are at your
healthiest and your best.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be great to love
and accept yourself and feel

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:90%
peaceful and strong and proud?

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Well you can, and
I'm here to help you.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Read this book.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.452 align:middle line:10%
Work this program.

00:45:48.452 --> 00:45:50.410 align:middle line:10%
You'll learn to release
the weight of the world

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:54.870 align:middle line:10%
off your mind and your body,
lose inches, and gain so much

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:10%
more.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:90%
What have you got to lose?

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.528 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.528 --> 00:46:02.980 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see why this is
such a popular book because it

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:90%
hits so many different issues.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing for me-- and
I read it-- is the boundaries,

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:90%
is the boundaries thing.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:84%
You said something
so key earlier.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You said, the way to have better
boundaries is to love yourself

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:19.490 align:middle line:90%
and to have higher self-esteem.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.970 align:middle line:84%
How you to just-- OK,
I'll love myself now.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Well, listen.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all you have
to surrender to the fact

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.640 align:middle line:90%
that you are like this, right?

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.689 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really
say, is this good for me?

00:46:31.689 --> 00:46:33.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask
yourself those questions.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Your body knows
when you're involved

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.610 align:middle line:84%
in an enmeshed situation
where you don't feel safe,

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:38.985 align:middle line:84%
because safety is
the key, right?

00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:41.401 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Surrender yourself to
the fact you were like what?

00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Like everything--

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.011 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Or that you're in a boundaried,
an inappropriate boundaried

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:50.141 align:middle line:90%
You always feel invaded, right?

00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.223 align:middle line:84%
It's like, have you ever had a
friend that will call you up?

00:46:54.223 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Ah, the anxiety.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with somebody who
will call me up and I'll go,

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't be friends
with this person.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:90%
They just give me such anxiety.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You explained
it perfectly.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading your book and
you said, it's around 4 o'clock

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.540 align:middle line:90%
when you want to eat so much.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.164 align:middle line:84%
And it was 4 o'clock,
and I was eating.

00:47:06.164 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, sitting
there at the soccer

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.980 align:middle line:84%
field after a full day of
work, 97,000 decisions,

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.980 align:middle line:84%
picking up the kids,
bringing them to the field,

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.850 align:middle line:84%
sitting there
going, I'm starving.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I hadn't
made a boundary--

00:47:18.657 --> 00:47:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't had a boundary all day.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.823 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And what
are you starting for?

00:47:21.823 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And boundaries mean giving
yourself-- here's the thing.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We need authentic
time for us, you know?

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.630 align:middle line:84%
We need that extreme self care
that Cheryl Richardson talks

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:32.130 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, that sense of,
I have to come first.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I will
not help anyone else.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.600 align:middle line:84%
What am I doing
to protect myself?

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Am I in an appropriate
relationship with this person?

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:90%
How does this serve me?

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.824 align:middle line:84%
Like, people pleasing is an
issue for me in that I want--

00:47:46.824 --> 00:47:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And most
boundary-less people as well.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, I mean I
can get myself into situations

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that I shouldn't because I
think I should, I have to,

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.220 align:middle line:90%
or I'm obliged to that person.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Or I feel they need
something and I'm

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.415 align:middle line:84%
obliged to give it to them
even at my own expense.

00:48:01.415 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Is this at my expense?

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Even nature, when something
is overgrown, eventually

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.490 align:middle line:90%
that plant will die, right?

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:15.137 align:middle line:84%
So that's way gardeners go in
and they prune trees, right?

00:48:15.137 --> 00:48:15.720 align:middle line:90%
So they go in.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.052 align:middle line:84%
And a vine can
choke another vine

00:48:19.052 --> 00:48:22.154 align:middle line:84%
if it becomes
inauthentic to itself.

00:48:22.154 --> 00:48:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.947 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the subtitle of your
book could be, just say no.

00:48:26.947 --> 00:48:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I know, yeah.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: People who feel
too much, and just say no.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:31.373 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Just say no.

00:48:31.373 --> 00:48:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Say no to the feelings,
say no to the overcrowding,

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:39.210 align:middle line:84%
as you were just talking about
with the vines of emotions,

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.580 align:middle line:90%
of people, and things, of space.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I sat there last night
in that chair in the soccer

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
field going, I don't
have a boundary problem.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.727 align:middle line:90%
I'm just hungry.

00:48:47.727 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was arguing
with your book.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.063 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:48:51.063 --> 00:48:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an
example of how it's not

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.807 align:middle line:84%
saying no to the emotions, it's
putting them in their place.

00:48:55.807 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
you the exercise.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you to
do this with me.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.722 align:middle line:84%
And just think back to
where you were stressed.

00:49:01.722 --> 00:49:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Think of your most
stressed moment.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you could imagine
that that stressed

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.492 align:middle line:84%
moment was an environment that
you inhabited rather than--

00:49:09.492 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and using environmental terms
rather than feelings you were

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.595 align:middle line:84%
feeling, what would
that place look like?

00:49:14.595 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You mean the place?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: A place.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It would be
tangled barbed wire.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID:
Tangled barbed wire.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And are you in the middle
of the tangled barbed wire?

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hmm.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: OK, and you
can't really get out, right?

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm mm.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's stressful.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
you can see it.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do is I'd like

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to invite you into an
indigenous moment, if you will.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous traditions
all suggest

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that the relationship between
the human spirit and God

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:84%
or the gods is symbolized
by a bird, right?

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.700 align:middle line:84%
In every one of our
consciousnesses,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.810 align:middle line:84%
the archetype of the bird
represents that to us

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.760 align:middle line:84%
from our most ancient
forebearers, ancestors.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you to
imagine that within you is

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.830 align:middle line:84%
a bird, a beautiful,
extraordinary, magical bird

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that will come and rescue
you out of that barbed wire.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
get on its back?

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to now ask you
to tell you what the bird is.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's huge.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: What kind is it?

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's kind of a hawk.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Kind of a hawk.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect, a spirit messenger.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.110 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.568 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you to
jump on the back

00:50:09.568 --> 00:50:11.440 align:middle line:84%
of that giant, beautiful
hawk, all right?

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And we'll ask its name.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's mythical looking.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.339 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:50:14.339 --> 00:50:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Mythical hawk
because it will be.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to sit
on the back of the hawk

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and just let that hawk
take you high, high,

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.250 align:middle line:84%
high up into the sky
until you actually

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.630 align:middle line:90%
see blue in your mind's eye.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hmm.

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Are you there?

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel up there?

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's like getting
in an airplane when you're

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in a storm and then you
go up over the clouds.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle line:90%
I just knew that was up here.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.003 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Now look over the side
and take a look down

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.360 align:middle line:84%
at the barbed wire area and
tell me how big or small it is.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Smaller.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Small.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Getting smaller as I'm
looking down at it, yeah.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.298 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:50:46.298 --> 00:50:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So how does it feel for you
up there to look at that?

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Does it have an impact on you?

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.245 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, there's
not a problem up there.

00:50:53.245 --> 00:50:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Or
down-- the barbed wire

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.100 align:middle line:90%
can exist as it is, right?

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.110 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to change it.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Where
would you like to go now?

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Forward.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.748 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:51:00.748 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Want to go to a sanctuary?

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:90%
So what if you had a place--

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to
go to an island.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Great.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:84%
What if you had a
place, this island,

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.170 align:middle line:84%
where everything was
safe and beautiful,

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and every single moment was
infused with spiritual energy

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that you could
actually see and feel?

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what that's like.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's an island
that I can see the parameters

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of, and I'm sitting
on a white sandy beach

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's beautiful and clear.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But I can see
everything around me.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not cluttered.

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Perfect.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.649 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:32.649 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's just leave that
for a second now, OK?

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:90%
So come back for now.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So did you feel a very
different experience

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.754 align:middle line:84%
from where you started to
where you are right now?

00:51:42.754 --> 00:51:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So if you could
just see that original place

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
as a place of barbed wire, does
it impact you at this moment?

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:50.642 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:51:50.642 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:51.849 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:90%
So we didn't change it.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:54.990 align:middle line:90%
We did not change the feelings.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.015 align:middle line:90%
We turned them into a place.

00:51:57.015 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton and I had this
great long conversation.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I completely think
he's a genius.

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:04.880 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
health of a cell

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.570 align:middle line:84%
was dictated by the environment,
that the nucleus was not

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:08.070 align:middle line:90%
the brain.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.149 align:middle line:84%
That the brain of the
cell was the membrane

00:52:11.149 --> 00:52:11.940 align:middle line:90%
of the cell, right?

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's a cellular
biologist, so he would know.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Correct.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.922 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:15.922 --> 00:52:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
him, I said, well--

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.050 align:middle line:84%
because his book was "Biology
of Belief," so I said,

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:22.370 align:middle line:84%
what if beliefs
were an environment?

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Like the membrane of our
lives was actually-- could we

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.890 align:middle line:84%
see it in environmental terms
if we use that language?

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.530 align:middle line:84%
What if I saw it in natural
terms in archetypal nature?

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what
the hu-- we are nature,

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.200 align:middle line:90%
so we understand nature.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And everything in nature is
symbolic to us, certainly

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to our ancestors and all the
indigenous peoples before us

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.760 align:middle line:90%
who we are related to.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Would they not be
in our cell memory?

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:48.730 align:middle line:90%
So I said, let's try it.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So we live in the environment
of our thoughts, feelings,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.550 align:middle line:84%
We do not live in the
physical environment fully.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.880 align:middle line:90%
We are only 5% present here.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Deepak will tell
you that, right?

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the matter
is is it is consciousness

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and our perception
of consciousness,

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and how we filter
information is mental.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when we're reaching
for that food and we're trying

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.390 align:middle line:90%
to numb ourselves--

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.411 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: We
first say, where am I?

00:53:16.411 --> 00:53:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.535 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So the
question I teach--

00:53:18.535 --> 00:53:21.333 align:middle line:84%
and Weight Release Energetics
is the coaching method

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:25.450 align:middle line:84%
for this particular-- It's a
module that I teach weight loss

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:84%
coaches, how to work
with this very thing

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:31.820 align:middle line:84%
where we get them to help
their clients on a weekly basis

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.650 align:middle line:84%
or biweekly basis, get past
their emotional content that

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.200 align:middle line:84%
keeps them going
back to the food

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.680 align:middle line:84%
or keeps them from losing the
weight, even no matter what

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:90%
little they're eating, right?

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting into that
place of safety and choice.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
too, it's proven,

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.250 align:middle line:84%
in mindfulness technique,
mindfulness meditation,

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:84%
eight weeks-- because this
is based on mindfulness--

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:56.040 align:middle line:84%
eight weeks will change the
neural pathways in the brain.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So rather than say, I don't
want to feel that, or even

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
analyze what you're
feeling, we're

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.660 align:middle line:84%
going to turn it
into barbed wire.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.105 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
somewhere else.

00:54:04.105 --> 00:54:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's actually
steps in the book.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.760 align:middle line:84%
There's four steps
that if you could, just

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.952 align:middle line:84%
talk on the four
steps really quickly.

00:54:10.952 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Step one is speak your truth.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.951 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Step one
is speak your truth.

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:14.985 align:middle line:90%
Which is like, own it.

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, like-- well, the next
one is own your truth, right?

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.220 align:middle line:90%
The first one is speak it.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Admit it.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Just say it out loud.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.440 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Really, don't be afraid
to say, I'm not safe.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.560 align:middle line:90%
This is how I am.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:90%
This is how I've been eating.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so much shame
and hiding around this that

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.360 align:middle line:90%
we need to be able to speak it.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Then own it.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.712 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've got
to say, OK, well.

00:54:34.712 --> 00:54:35.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like surrendering.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like alcoholism.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you speak your
truth and speak it for at least

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.300 align:middle line:84%
a week and get
into that pattern.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.989 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
week is owning it.

00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: You own it.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:45.738 align:middle line:84%
And then you really
feel it in your body.

00:54:45.738 --> 00:54:47.010 align:middle line:90%
You have to integrate that.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.250 align:middle line:90%
You just saw what you said.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.560 align:middle line:90%
You've got to integrate it.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.345 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I can't even
remember my next two steps,

00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:52.302 align:middle line:90%
I'm so jet-lagged.

00:54:52.302 --> 00:54:53.595 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Three is reclaim
your power to choose.

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yes, which is
what we just did with envision.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.610 align:middle line:84%
We teach people how to choose
by giving them an exercise that

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.420 align:middle line:84%
takes them out of the
analytical, intellectual,

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
rational mind and into
the right brain intuitive.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
am an intuitive,

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm a psychic medium, all you
want to call those things,

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:90%
but this is the intuitive brain.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.870 align:middle line:84%
This is where we go
creatively to solve this

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.090 align:middle line:90%
without going into that.

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
to me, this is my story,

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.400 align:middle line:84%
this is the thing, this
is what I'm feeling.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't label it.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Just tell me what it looks like.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then the last one
is reconnect without losing

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:30.737 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:55:30.737 --> 00:55:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
being able to say no,

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:36.160 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that something
is good for you or not,

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:90%
how to test your body.

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, and not even
with muscle testing.

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just a true false question.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.602 align:middle line:90%
Is this true, is this false?

00:55:44.602 --> 00:55:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So am I hungry really?

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Or is it an emotion that
I'm trying to sabotage,

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.517 align:middle line:90%
trying to cover over?

00:55:51.517 --> 00:55:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trying to fill.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Or
what am I hungry for?

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And then recognizing
the detours.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It does take time.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Because people who feel too
much will always feel too much.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm always
going to be an alcoholic.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.034 align:middle line:90%
I just can't drink.

00:56:08.034 --> 00:56:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I have that.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I really believe I have that
predisposition to addiction.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.682 align:middle line:10%
The grace for me is that
I don't play with it.

00:56:16.682 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:10%
You know, I know somebody
in this new age ideas

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.515 align:middle line:10%
like, well, how could
you call yourself that?

00:56:20.515 --> 00:56:21.725 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, because I'm smart.

00:56:21.725 --> 00:56:22.621 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:24.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because you're
speaking your truth

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.325 align:middle line:10%
and you're owning your truth.

00:56:25.325 --> 00:56:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I'm owning it.

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I am a person who
feels too much,

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and I have to be careful that
if I don't take care of myself,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.670 align:middle line:84%
if I don't get proper
sleep, if I'm not

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.340 align:middle line:90%
supporting myself-- my brain.

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.280 align:middle line:90%
My brain chemistry.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.390 align:middle line:90%
So we have supplements.

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a whole
program with supplements.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I love
the weight loss coach.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually I think
that's a great idea

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody
who's there to mentor

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:46.085 align:middle line:84%
you through it, to talk you
through it on a regular basis,

00:56:46.085 --> 00:56:48.460 align:middle line:84%
so when you hit up against
that thing-- which will always

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.376 align:middle line:84%
be there-- there's
somebody there to help you.

00:56:50.376 --> 00:56:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I think this is a fabulous idea.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.453 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: The
training is amazing.

00:56:53.453 --> 00:56:56.061 align:middle line:84%
My coaches lost an average
of 20 to 40 pounds.

00:56:56.061 --> 00:56:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that didn't
need to lose weight

00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.861 align:middle line:84%
felt like the weight of
the world lifted on them.

00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:01.621 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, my one coach's
pants fall down.

00:57:01.621 --> 00:57:02.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.857 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even notice that
she'd lost so much weight,

00:57:04.857 --> 00:57:05.690 align:middle line:90%
her pants fell down.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:06.648 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're amazing.

00:57:06.648 --> 00:57:08.691 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been such
a revealing interview.

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we started off
talking about weight loss

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.940 align:middle line:84%
but it was just basically
the entry into your life

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and how you have come
to really, really

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:18.440 align:middle line:84%
solve the problem
of emotional eating

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.760 align:middle line:90%
is going through the steps.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.696 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely does.

00:57:21.696 --> 00:57:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Colette.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:90%

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.570 align:middle line:90%

00:57:24.653 --> 00:57:25.340 align:middle line:90%
