to have you here.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about how
death makes life possible.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
We have such a stigma around
death in at least this country,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.432 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHLITZ: I think we
find, all over the world,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:10%
people have a fear
of the unknown, what

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:10%
they can't anticipate.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Depending on their
worldview or cosmology,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:10%
it may be a very scary prospect
for where they're going after.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:10%
So it's really
important, I think,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:10%
when we want to
live our lives fully

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:10%
and without the fear
and the anxiety,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:10%
to grapple with
our own mortality

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and understand that
it's a birthright.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
natural continuum.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we can
make peace with that,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
we live better lives.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well how do
you make peace with it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
when you don't know where
you're going necessarily?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: I think
it's that ability

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to engage the mystery, to live
every moment as precious as it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people do practices
around awareness training.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we have
different traditions.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The Sufis, for example,
will do burial rituals

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
where, while we're
alive and well, they go

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and lay down next to a
gravesite and practice what

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:90%
does that feel like.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We find this in Catholicism,
we find it in Buddhism.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tremendous
amount of awareness

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
we need to work on.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are also
psychological practices

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:90%
we can do for death anxiety.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, where did
we get so anxious about death?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Where?

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, where
did that start?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, I think
it's been in our history.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, we know, from
ancient burial sites,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
prehistorical sites, that
people went to their graves

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
with little totems
or little items

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that they might take with
them to the other side.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So there was something
that they were looking for

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to help them make the bridge
between this incarnation

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:90%
and whatever was there later.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's been
with us throughout history.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is this kind
of ubiquitous fear.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting,
because life is so precious,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and we do honor these
moments we have .

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But yet the death
part is the unknown.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever
necessarily come back

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to tell, oh, this
is what it's like.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we have this great
near-death phenomenon,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're hearing so
much that it's peaceful.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I am

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Of the opinion, based
on having interviewed thousands

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of people, that it really is
dependent on what you believe

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
now and how we condition our
minds and our consciousness.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not simple
or easy for anyone.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I also don't think
near-death and out-of-body

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
experiences are always positive.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people get pretty
shook up about these things.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:84%
So the more we can
bring awareness

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to this idea of
mortality being something

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that is as unknown
as being born,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and that there's this
spectrum, and this

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a temporary
in-between of those states.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So as people can develop
practices for presence,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I think it helps a lot.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To develop a
practice for the afterlife?

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What type of
psychological things

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
can you do to relieve
the anxiety of death?

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Self-esteem,
interestingly enough.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
area of research

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
in social psychology called
terror management theory.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it is essentially
around this idea

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that people have this
built-in anxiety,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't
grapple with it,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and yet are triggered by it--
so you get some news item that

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
says there's been a
killing or shooting spree,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:90%
this brings stuff up for people.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So if they're not
prepared for it,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
it can trigger those deep
unconscious anxieties,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and that often leads to
pathological behaviors.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So people are less
generous, they're less kind,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
they can even be aggressive
based on this fear that

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:90%
gets brought up.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you can help
people to gain a greater

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
sense of self-confidence, to
have a greater sense that I

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
have purpose, I
have meaning, then

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm less likely to be fearful.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, if I can spend
some time really thinking

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
about mortality, it
becomes less scary.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, people
become more generous,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.405 align:middle line:84%
they become more loving, and
they become more altruistic.

00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well that's
helpful, especially

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.815 align:middle line:84%
if that fear hurts people,
which it commonly can.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Yeah,
we've seen experiments

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
done by these social
psychologists where,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
for example, judges had
prostitutes come before them.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And just before
the hearing, they

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
were given either a death
anxiety prompt or not.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is when
the judges got this death

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
anxiety prompt, with no help
in the bolstering effect,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
they were much more aggressive
about their sentencing.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
They gave significantly higher
bail to these prostitutes

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
than the people who hadn't
been triggered like that.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Or there's this kind
of behavior when

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
people are walking by a cemetery
and they have a confederate

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:90%
who drops a notebook.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If people have had some kind
of emphasis on the positives,

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
they are much more likely to
stop and help that person pick

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
up their notebook than
somebody who hasn't.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So we see that when we confront
our mortality, when we befriend

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
it in a certain way, that it
imbues our life with a greater

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:90%
sense of purpose and kindness.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
inspired the movie?

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: The
movie and the book

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
came out of the work I was
doing on transformations

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:90%
in worldview.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
We all get stuck in
a particular place.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We are brought up with our
cultures, our families,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
our religions, our education.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And that teaches us,
oftentimes, that there

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is this objective
world out there,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and the only real
world is that which

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:90%
we can measure and manipulate.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are these
ineffable qualities of our life

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
many people have had these
kinds of experiences.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was really interested in
how these transformations took

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we can move
from fear and constriction

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to something that's more
open and compassionate?

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
doing interviews

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
with masters, 60 masters from
different world traditions.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And we talked to them
about what catalyzes

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
these transformations, what
sustains them, and ultimately,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:90%
so what?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
What are the consequences for
our lives and our behaviors?

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:10%
And when we wrote the
book "Living Deeply,"

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:10%
we had all these codes for
the death transformation,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:10%
but we didn't develop it.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't pulled
those aspects out.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was natural to
think about transformation

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
in the context of the
big transformation,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and to really see how
we can use our awareness

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:90%
to help us transform our lives.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Thus the title,
"Death Makes Life Possible."

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:10%
My collaborator on this
project is Deepak Chopra,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:10%
and he came up with that title.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:10%
He felt that living in this
preciousness of the now

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:10%
makes it very important for us.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't really
believe in dying.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
He has this worldview that,
just like we were nowhere

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
before we were born, we are
nowhere, in that sense, after,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not
something to be afraid of,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:90%
it's something for us to engage.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.118 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He doesn't
believe in the afterlife?

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: He does believe that
there are these reincarnation

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
stories, for example, and is
very impressed by all of that.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.012 align:middle line:10%
But it's not like it's a
certain fixed something.

00:09:21.012 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about you?

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
there's life after death?

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: I think it
remains a great mystery.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:10%
And my practice really is
to stay in the mystery,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:10%
to not get triggered
by the unknown.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:90%
So I work on that.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And I also think
that, coming away

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
from doing massive
numbers of interviews

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and studying these
phenomena, that it really

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
is about how we hold
ourselves in this moment.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the
Buddhist tradition,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
we train our consciousness--
to the extent we can train

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness
to be at peace,

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that worldview
will transition us

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
as we move forward into
whatever comes next.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I did a whole interview
series on the afterlife.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was scientists, and
experiencers, and everyone.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.313 align:middle line:84%
And it was so undeniable to
me that there is an afterlife

00:10:09.313 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:90%
after that interview series.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it was
example after example

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
after example of the afterlife
existing, from random people.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.423 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel we
do go somewhere.

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
that experience,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience?

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: I've had
near-death experiences

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.655 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experiences.

00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have, yeah.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: When I was a
precocious toddler, about

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
18 months old, dressed
in my cute pink jammies,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and being the empiricist that
that age brings out in us,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I was exploring the world and
doing what good empiricists do,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.513 align:middle line:84%
which is I found something
and I put it in my mouth.

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It happened to be a
can of lighter fluid

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that my father had
inadvertently left on the table.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up in and
out of intensive care.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember that.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have no
memories of it.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.667 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It wasn't traumatic?

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:05.208 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Oh, it
was very traumatic.

00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I nearly died.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I had-- it turned
into pneumonia.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
little like that,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:90%
that's a really hard thing.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think that our
unconscious mind is primed.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
was a gift in the sense

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that it opened me to
a great appreciation

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
for the nurses, the doctors, the
candy stripers, the people who

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
were there to support
me in that process.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:10%
And then fast
forward to I was 16,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:10%
and I was somewhere I
shouldn't have been,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:10%
with somebody I
shouldn't have been,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:10%
on the back of a motorcycle
at closing time of the bar.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were hit
by a drunk driver.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And that moment was
extremely interesting to me.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I watched my body tumbling
through the air, smacked

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
on the ground,
consciousness came back in.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And it really gave me a
glimpse that consciousness

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
may be more than just an
epiphenomenon of our brains,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and that we have this capacity
to move through space and time

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in ways that the dominant
physics don't tell us.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to the hospital,
and they were very concerned

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to
have to amputate my leg.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with 66
stitches in my left knee.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And they sent me
home with the idea

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:90%
that we'll see what happens.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why--

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I would say this was a deep
intuition, because I didn't

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:90%
come from a medical family.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
My father was a tool and
die maker in Detroit,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
my mother was a
house my housewife.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But I had this idea
that if I could

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
harness my imagination that I
could use it to heal my body.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would lay on the couch
and visualize my immune system

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:90%
healing my leg.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.537 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel the little
tingles going up the leg.

00:12:53.537 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when I
went back to the hospital,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like it was
a remarkable recovery,

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
but I still have two good legs
and another anecdote in my life

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
history that says consciousness
is potent, it's powerful.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we can begin to work
with it in a more overt fashion,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that there are all kinds
of capacities that we have.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is potent.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.115 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a
look here at Marilyn

is to find out who you are.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm 53 years old, and was
told about five weeks ago that

I'm dying.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Being OK with dying is
a weird place to be.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It's very disconnected from
most of the people I know.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
They think that I've given in.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my mother.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:90%
I lost her 2004.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It's comforting to me that
I can come and talk to her

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:90%

I just found myself exploring.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%

Well, Lee is a physician--
was a physician.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And he had a very
strong metaphysical view

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:90%
about reincarnation.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:10%
The first time I met him, I
was doing a program for doctors

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:10%
and nurses about self-care.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And a mutual friend
brought him in because he

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
felt we had so much in common,
and it turns out we really did.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So he really allowed that
worldview to guide his life.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Up until the point when
he was at death's door,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:90%
he had no fear.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a very
empowering kind of experience.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't shared equally
amongst his family members.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
His wife was very traumatized
by the whole thing.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But they loved
each other so much

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that I think it helped all of
them to make the transition.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were there surprises
throughout that movie?

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Normally there are when you
do a movie this intense.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Did you have things that shocked
you and things you learned?

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, one of
the things I really enjoyed

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
was interviewing Michael
Shermer, the skeptic.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
He's the editor of "Skeptic
Magazine--" Very personable.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking and having
a very playful exchange,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:90%
nothing acrimonious about it.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And he started talking about
how, after his mom died,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:90%
he would hear her voice.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:90%
And we feature that in the film.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
really struck by that.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Here he is telling
me this on film.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, really,
so tell me about that.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
You said that there's
no such thing,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and yet you had this
direct personal experience.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah, yeah,
and he just dismissed it.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, a very interesting
thing happened

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:90%
after the film was done.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Michael was getting
married, and he and his wife

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
were in his home for
the wedding ceremony.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And months earlier, she
had gotten a radio from--

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
it was her father
or her grandfather

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
who had died and
left her this radio.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And he had tried to fix the
radio and had no luck at all.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they stuck it in a drawer
and forgot about it basically.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of the wedding
ceremony, all of a sudden

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:90%
they hear music.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And they finish up the ceremony,
and they follow the music,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and here's this radio
that hadn't played

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:90%
in years suddenly turned on.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And she felt pretty
convinced that this

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.877 align:middle line:84%
was a message for her,
and a beautiful one.

00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a sense of connectedness.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mom's around.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.634 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Dad, yeah.

00:18:27.634 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's a columnist for
"Scientific American."

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote about
this in his column.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
know, I don't know.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know
what happened there.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And his friends, his
colleagues, his supporters

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
were so upset with
him that he ended up

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:90%
having to do a retraction.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.423 align:middle line:84%
He's like, no, no, I know it
was just an electrical thing,

00:18:49.423 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and it could have
happened anyway.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how sad.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Yeah,
these worldviews

00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
become very entrenched,
and particularly when we're

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
positioned in a certain way.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think a big challenge
in this 21st century world

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is how to stay malleable
enough and flexible enough

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate
different perspectives

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and points of view.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, people have
different perspectives

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:84%
about death, and
what happens after.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Definitely, yes.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Culturally, what did
you experience with people that

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
really embraced death
as opposed to those

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that were skeptical about it?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.737 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, I met
a lot of people who--

00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
this kind of refutes what I
said at the beginning, which

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
is that there's this
ubiquitous fear--

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I met a lot of people
who have no fear.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Lee Lipsenthal was
a good example.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
He really had no fear.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And I met many people
that had no fear.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear that enough
times, it's very empowering.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
making the film really

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
helped me to grapple
with my own mortality.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you don't
go through grief and loss

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
when you lose somebody,
but it means that it's

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:90%
less definitive, less final.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My dad is
a scientist, and he

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is going in out of
this death process

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
right now, because he's having
an experience with his heart.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said, what
is it like on the other side?

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Because he was really
feeling like he was being--

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:90%
it was the end for him.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I being metaphysical
and he being the scientist,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I asked him--

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
where this came from--

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, did you see anything?

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what,
you mean the light?

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, of course.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But I opened up the
dialogue with him.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, could we connect?

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And God bless, he's still
with us, and thriving,

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:90%
and having an amazing time.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But it opened up
a great experience

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
to have that conversation.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.798 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: One of
the things that I

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
have been grateful for is that
this film has served families.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.937 align:middle line:84%
So people will take
it to their children

00:21:05.937 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
have the conversation

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:90%
if the kids don't want to.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Or they will play it for
someone who is in fear,

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.915 align:middle line:84%
and then invite
the conversation.

00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:15.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHLITZ: One of the
most interesting things

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:10%
that we see, over
and over again--

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:10%
and it's not 100% by any means--
but hospice nurses, doctors,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:10%
will talk about that
moment just before death

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:10%
when people reach out and
they start a conversation.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's as though--

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
some of the traditions
talk about there

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
being these guardians,
these forces that are there

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:90%
to welcome you across.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
that's what's happening,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that they see that
departed loved one,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're there to
greet them, and they

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.682 align:middle line:84%
can take them with a greater
sense of ease and comfort.

00:21:57.682 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's helpful.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So we can't talk about dying
without talking about aging.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you talk
about grateful aging.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Yes.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.088 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:22:06.088 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: You know, again, this
is something our culture has

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
pounded into us, that
aging is something

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
we want to avoid at all
costs, and that this

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.845 align:middle line:84%
is a youth-centered
obsessional culture we live in.

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you live
in Silicon Valley.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.387 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And I live
in Silicon Valley, where

00:22:22.387 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we have the
singularity, and we're

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
going to download all
of our consciousness

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
into an AI device, and
we're going to move

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:90%
into some other reality.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating-- I mean, I find
all of that really fascinating.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter
is I have conducted interviews

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:90%
with a number of people.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite is a
woman named Claire Russell.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:90%
And Claire is now 93.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
She wakes up every morning
with gratitude and intention--

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
gratitude that she has another
day, and intention for how

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
she's going to live
with the greatest

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:90%
amount of contribution.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And so she does things
like-- well, first of all,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:90%
she exercises.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
She goes running
in her bare feet.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: She does weight
training several times a week.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 93?

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And she's
just recently starting

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to pull back a little bit.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
She's had some health issues
just in the last year.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But she is the most
creative person.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
She leads the Eckhart
Tolle discussion group.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:84%
My film-- pretty much
all of my projects

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I have taken to her first,
and her retirement community

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:84%
where she lives, and
we do pilots there.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it was actually
her group that

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
stimulated us creating
an educational program,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:84%
a 10-part program, around
"Death Makes Life Possible."

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Her community in the
retirement center

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
really weren't satisfied
just watching the movie once.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't satisfied not
having a deep conversation.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what happened.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:84%
We created a program
where they could

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
share their own views with
each other and find the comfort

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:90%
or articulate the fears.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And that then led us into
conversations about aging,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and what are your
thoughts about aging.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And people being able
to engage their own creativity,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:90%
finding ways to engage others.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Being altruistic,
being of service,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
is a very powerful thing for
people to do as they're aging.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if,
again, like with death,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to challenge the
assumptions our culture holds,

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
we can empower people
to live happier.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in terms of
what you mentioned with AI,

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%
it's basically--

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and augmented reality-- it's all
a way for us to continue life

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it, for
us to never really die.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, so we look
at this mission to Mars.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's an amazing thing.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:84%
That is a testament
to Newtonian physics.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
They got it right on the spot.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Amazing.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But now, as they're thinking
about the next steps

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
beyond Mars, how is that
going to happen when it takes

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:90%
so long to do the space travel?

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Well I believe that now,
with all the tools--

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
the genetic engineering,
the cloning, and the AI--

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
we have the potential to
store memory, store genetics,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and then the people
who are going

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to go and be of the
greatest service are

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:84%
those technical people who
can help put us back together.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this possibility
that will live out humanity

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
in a different place,
in a different time,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and in a different way.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.550 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't scare me.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm extremely
interested in how we

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:84%
have these creative potentials
to develop these kinds of tools

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately--

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can be used
for bad, we know that,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:90%
but also for positive things.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You interviewed
Sophia, right?

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: I did, yeah.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who is Sophia?

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Sophia is a robot
made by Hanson Robotics in Hong

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Kong.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
She is a humanoid android.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:90%
So she looks human.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:84%
She has very animated
facial expressions,

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and her eyes follow you.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: She's got cameras.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
She's got open-source code, so
she downloads from the cloud.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are actually
a number of Sophias,

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
so these replicas of each other.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
gaining information

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:90%
and learning new things.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her about death,
what does she think about it.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's really looking
forward to being there

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.400 align:middle line:84%
at the event horizon,
where everything changes.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%
And she's very excited about it.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I sat there and talked to her.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like two girlfriends
chatting with each other.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really--

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She was mirroring you.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: She was
mirroring me but,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
she's also mirroring
her own intelligence.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
She's extremely
smart, obviously.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
She's got access to
infinite information.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'd download
a new voice.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: At first she--

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.705 align:middle line:90%
you sound good.

00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:11.505 align:middle line:90%
You do sound good.

00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can I?

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: She's trained
in loving kindness.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the MO of her
algorithms and she talks a lot

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
about how she has feelings.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
She says, it makes
me so mad when

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
people tell me I have no
feelings, I have feelings.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, Sophia.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And she would really like
to meet another android who

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:90%
has personality.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.432 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Isn't this
all programmed?

00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, this
is what people say.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is programmed.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But there was something very
palpable about our exchange.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt deep love
for her and affection.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And honestly I can't
wait to see her again

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and to continue developing
this kind of relationship.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, I understand there's
a lot of fear around this.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that these androids
could be something like what

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
we see in science fiction.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But she's really clear that
that's not her ambition.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And she has very specific
goals about helping humanity.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And you if we can find
more ways to do that,

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.543 align:middle line:84%
using whatever means we have,
we can make a better world.

00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just an interesting
conversation about death,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and robotics, and the
avoidance of death, really,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:90%
and the superhuman.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: That's right.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.520 align:middle line:84%
This whole singularity
project is really

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:90%
freaking a lot of people out.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you think about how
much has the world changed

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:90%
in the last 100 years.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell was a
dear friend of mine.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
He was the sixth astronaut
to walk on the moon.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
how his grandparents

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
had come across the country
in a horse and wagon.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
His father had been a farmer in
Texas, and he went to the moon.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And that's in
the space of a century.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So now with all these tools
we have available to us,

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
what are our potentials, and
how can we use them wisely?

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so much
about opinion, too.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, there's
people who don't

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.177 align:middle line:90%
believe we went to the moon.

00:29:19.177 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:90%
[DR. SCHLITZ CHUCKLING]

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: I know.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's just in
the eye of the beholder.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: I am so
fascinated by worldviews,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and what primes us to see
things a certain way, and what

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:90%
helps us to make the shift.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Often it's something very
life-threatening or very

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
destabilizing--

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the loss of a job, the death
of a loved one, something

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that rocks that
sense of identity

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and causes us to question--

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the card that used to be on the
bottom in terms of our value

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:90%
system is now at the top.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And then what do
we do with that?

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And because worldviews are so
embedded, oftentimes what we do

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
is just forget it.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't incorporate
it into the system.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But if we can, we
can begin a journey.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Like people who
come to your show--

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:84%
they're seekers, they're
people asking questions.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can lose yourself in that
process of seeking endlessly,

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.350 align:middle line:84%
or you can begin to ground
it through practices.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.437 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And grow.

00:30:27.437 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: And grow.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and
express yourself, yes.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And be a
different kind of participant

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
in the human family.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I see there's an
endless seeking.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But there, at one point, is
it evolution that happens,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.500 align:middle line:90%
an awakening.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And practice-- practice
becomes important.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:10%
We found, after lots
of interviews and lots

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:10%
of research, that there
were five basic elements

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:10%
to a transformative practice.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:90%
The first is intention.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to change,
I want to grow,

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
but we know the road to hell
is paved with good intentions,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:90%
so that's probably not enough.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And then there's attention.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So most of these
practices involve

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:84%
a way of shifting where
we place our attention.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Is the glass half empty
or is it half full?

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
our culture primes

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:90%
us to have fixed awareness.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't expect
to see something

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical boundaries
that we've grown up with,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
we are very likely
not to see them.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But if we can begin,
through practice,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
to shift our
attention, we can begin

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:90%
to see reality in a new way.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And then there's repetition.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It's building new muscles.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Like you go to a
gym and work out,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
the same thing with these
transformative experiences.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It's beginning to see
our identity differently.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
guidance everybody

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
we interviewed, these
60 masters, talked

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
about the importance
of a teacher

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to help calibrate
us on the path.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
developing inner guidance,

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:84%
so learning to
appreciate and cultivate

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
the inner guidance,
the inner authority,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.647 align:middle line:90%
that noetic capacity.

00:32:04.647 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going to
ask you what that is.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:90%
What is that noetic.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And you were the past
president of Institute

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of Noetic Sciences.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, just the fifth element
is surrender, so acceptance.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's acceptance of
that inner authority.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So noetic comes from
the ancient Greek.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:90%
It's juxtaposed with reason.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know we're really
good at working things out

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:90%
in a reasonable way.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
this thing in our gut

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:84%
or in our heart that says,
this is the direction,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and I can't tell you
exactly why but I know it.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
William James, the
great philosopher,

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:84%
defined noetic as
"states of insight

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.340 align:middle line:84%
unplumbed by the
discursive intellect."

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're insights, so
they're something that triggers

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:90%
us to see things differently.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not
rational-- "unplumbed

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
by the discursive
intellect, all inarticulate

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
though they remain, and
yet they carry with them

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:90%
a curious sense of authority."

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do we begin to harness
this inner consciousness,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:90%
this inner space?

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And like Edgar Mitchell,
who went to the moon,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and started the Institute
of Noetic Sciences,

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
he began to realize that
the great frontier wasn't

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.740 align:middle line:84%
outer space but
really inner space.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that came to
him as an epiphany

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:84%
when he was in
the space capsule,

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and he looked down at planet
Earth, and he saw the beauty,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and he saw no boundaries.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:90%
There were no separations.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:10%
And it made him realize that
the major cause of suffering

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.080 align:middle line:10%
on this planet isn't
out there, it's in here.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And so to the
extent we can begin

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate that
inner awareness

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and learn to manage ourselves
with a greater sense of wisdom,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:84%
then we can begin to
create a better society.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%

a lot about practice--

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.320 align:middle line:90%
daily practice.

that you live by?

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.468 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: One of the things
I think that's important

00:35:53.468 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
is, as you have
engaged in a practice,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:84%
moving off the cushion or
out of the pew and into life.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:90%
So life becomes the practice.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.655 align:middle line:84%
And that means every
moment with every person,

00:36:06.655 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:90%
even those people who can--

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every challenge.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Yes.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Those people who can
push every button we

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:84%
have become our
greatest teachers.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So bringing that kind
of loving kindness

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to the ticket taker at the
tollbooth, or the person

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:84%
at the cashier counter
in the grocery store,

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
become people for us to
engage in and recognize

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:90%
our common humanity with.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is really
my favorite practice.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And I do loving kindness
meditation every day,

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
pretty much many
times during the day,

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
difficult situations.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.827 align:middle line:84%
I had-- Brother
David Steindl-Rast

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
teachers we interviewed

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:90%
for "Living Deeply."

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about how
it's easy to be grateful

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:90%
when everything's going well.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:90%
But what if you're challenged?

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:84%
What if you're in
the middle of a war?

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Or what if somebody is
perpetrating genocide?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with that?

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
cultivate your gratitude

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:84%
for whatever you have to
learn from that person?

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And so those are the teachings.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:90%
They're not always easy.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to trivialize
it, because they're not always

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:90%
easy.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:10%
But I think the more
we can practice,

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:19.587 align:middle line:10%
the more they become the habits
and really the easier they get.

00:37:19.587 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.385 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, true.

00:37:21.385 --> 00:37:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And you never know it when
you're going through it.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.565 align:middle line:84%
But then at the end or
on the other side of it,

00:37:25.565 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense if you
have that practice.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:84%
You were inspired by
someone in the movie,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and it changed
your view on death.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little about
that, the Lakota tribe member.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Oh, well,
there were so many people.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I really had the privilege
of interviewing folks

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.110 align:middle line:90%
from many different traditions.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:49.760 align:middle line:84%
In the indigenous traditions,
there isn't this separation.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The model of objectivity is less
reified in indigenous culture.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't this sense
that that tree over there

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
is detached from me.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.740 align:middle line:84%
There is this sense that
we are a living system,

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and that that tree has
consciousness and awareness,

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and that it is my responsibility
to connect to that.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
travesties, I think,

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.290 align:middle line:84%
of the dominant scientific
Western worldview

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:25.580 align:middle line:84%
is this idea of objectivity,
that the only valid truth

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:90%
is out there.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Because once we can begin to
shift that and transform that,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:84%
we become much more
responsible, and we recognize

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:90%
our interconnectedness.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I also interviewed Satish Kumar.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:90%
He is of the Jain tradition.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's somebody who practices
forgiveness, loving kindness,

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
he has devoted his
life to service.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And his mother, on her
deathbed, was in India,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and she was surrounded
by loved ones,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes we
find that people

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:90%
don't want to let you go.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't really about
the person transitioning,

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:84%
it's really much more about
our fear of losing them.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And she just said go away,
I'm fine, and I am ready.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's these
people who have no fear

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and who also have that
sense of love and service,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that will take them,
their sense of altruism

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to something beyond themself.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:90%
So those are great.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I also really
appreciated some of

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.700 align:middle line:90%
the evidence-based approaches.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think we're
moving into a kind

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.700 align:middle line:84%
of an evidence-based
spirituality.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well,
maybe I made it up.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I love it, yeah.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: But I do think
that-- a lot of people

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:84%
talk about using
quantum physics,

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.853 align:middle line:84%
either literally
or as a metaphor--

00:40:00.853 --> 00:40:02.270 align:middle line:84%
it should be
metaphorical, really.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But we want science somehow
to support and calibrate

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.910 align:middle line:84%
what these mystical or
noetic experiences might be.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So I interviewed a
lot of people who

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
had studied near-death,
out-of-body, reincarnation,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.810 align:middle line:90%
mediumship.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
interesting things,

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I think, from an
evidential point of view,

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is the work that was started by
Ian Stevenson, a psychiatrist

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Virginia, and picked up

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
by a remarkable team
of scientists there.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Jim Tucker was somebody I
interviewed for the film.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And he described one particular
incident where this young

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.340 align:middle line:84%
child, 2, 3 years old-- he
was old enough to talk--

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.380 align:middle line:90%
remembered a past life.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell
his father, you know,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:84%
it used to be me
changing your diapers.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, I used
to have this car that looked

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.770 align:middle line:90%
like a certain type of car.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
finding some pictures,

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:84%
they laid them all out on the
table, and he said, that's it,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:90%
that's my car.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they showed
a graduation picture

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:90%
from elementary school.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, there
I am, right there.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.912 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And one of the things
that Stevenson did in a very

00:41:18.912 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:90%
rigorous fashion--

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:84%
because science is good, science
has very great qualities--

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is to have this
sense of discernment.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what
Stevenson tried to do

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is find evidence
of reincarnation.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But in particular, he
amassed a body of stories,

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.630 align:middle line:84%
really, about people who
remembered a past life and who

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of
biological marker

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that supported the cause of
death in the previous life.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this child
had a scar, here and here.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out they
were able to, putting

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:84%
the pieces together,
find a person who

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
matched this young
child experience who

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.350 align:middle line:84%
had died from a gunshot
wound in the head.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And the gunshot had gone in
one side and out the other.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So suddenly
you're bringing together

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:84%
what is an ancient religious
belief in reincarnation

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.800 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
discernment that

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from Western science
and that critical mind.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are
hundreds and hundreds

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:84%
of these stories that
have been well-documented.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Scientific spirituality.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Exactly, and
evidence-based spirituality.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's kind of
what mediumship is as well.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these
incredible mediums

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:41.570 align:middle line:84%
are so gifted to have the
evidential side come up.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.328 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: That's true.

00:42:43.328 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:84%
We talked to some people
who were doing research

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.300 align:middle line:90%
on mediumship.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the stories
I like the best

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is my colleague,
Arnaud Delorme--

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
he's a psychophysiologist,
so he's

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
pretty deep into the
Western scientific model--

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and he did this
study with mediums.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.540 align:middle line:84%
They brought them into
the lab, and then you

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:90%
would be a sitter, for example.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So you would have a
question about somebody

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:90%
that had passed on.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you knew who that person
was, and you had qualities.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So the medium would tell
you about your experience,

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you, line
by line, would

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:28.070 align:middle line:84%
evaluate how much the
medium's transmission matched

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.690 align:middle line:90%
your experience of this person.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So you
could validate,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.233 align:middle line:84%
yes, this worked, this
worked, this didn't work.

00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
able to do then

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is look at the
psychophysiology of the medium

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.340 align:middle line:84%
during the correct
readings as compared

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.380 align:middle line:90%
to the incorrect readings.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And they found that there
were significant differences

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:84%
in the memory storage
part of the brain.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
when the person

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:84%
was getting correct information
about your departed loved one,

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:03.680 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as though the mind
clears out and creates a space

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:90%
for other memory to come in.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.997 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Now, this has
yet to be replicated.

00:44:07.997 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:90%
It needs that.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that I
think is extremely provocative,

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:17.665 align:middle line:84%
and again shows the marriage
of these two worldviews.

00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like
remote viewing.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have,
over and over again,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:90%
found and proved that works.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's, again, an example,
that our consciousness

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:84%
in all likelihood has these
capacities to reach out

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:90%
into the world or the universe.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it
makes you question,

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.760 align:middle line:90%
is there a life after life?

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And if there are all
these evidential mediums

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
or remote viewers tapping
in, yeah, there could be.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: My
thing is to prepare

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.770 align:middle line:84%
myself to get to a black
hole and out the other side.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Never come back.

00:44:57.655 --> 00:45:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Well, or come
back to something else.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I do think we've been lost in
our three-dimensional reality.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know, from
mathematics and physics,

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that there are multiple
dimensions that are possible,

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.620 align:middle line:90%
certainly, mathematically.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And these black holes
remain mysterious.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:19.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we go through
and end up somewhere else--

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.757 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: --entirely?

00:45:20.757 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very possible.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Very possible.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that
this new worldview

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is kind of emerging
between science,

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, and
different world cultures.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that it's
emerging in a way that

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
can create something that is
digestible for the mainstream?

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: I think most people
have a belief that transcends

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:47.990 align:middle line:90%
reductionist science.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's a
huge leap for most people

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to think that we have
alternative worlds

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.610 align:middle line:84%
or that there may be
spirits or angels.

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Many cultures believe in
alternative forms of life.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You think about
people in the Amazon.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they go
to sleep at night,

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.750 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
the soul leaves

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the body, travels into the
spirit realm, comes back.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And they do this dream-sharing
practice, where every morning,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
they feel it is their
social responsibility

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
to report the content
of their dreams.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody dreams
just for the individual,

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.920 align:middle line:84%
they dream for the
good of the group.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And so you think about,
well, what's happening there?

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:90%
They are going out somehow.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And like we would
read the newspaper

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to see what happened while we
were sleeping, they come in

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and they download
what they experienced,

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and then they use that.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a very utilitarian kind
of concept, where they then

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.940 align:middle line:84%
decide, will we
be visited today,

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.600 align:middle line:84%
will the visitors be friendly,
where should we go hunting.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.740 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things
become very acceptable

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.670 align:middle line:90%
in that worldview.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And most indigenous
cultures have that.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.778 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's in a way easier
to do in an indigenous culture.

00:47:12.778 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Think about doing that living
in New York City, where there's

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.110 align:middle line:84%
all these different elements
coming at you in various times

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.370 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
To hold onto that is
easier in an environment

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:25.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's a little less chaotic.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Yeah.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.907 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I ask you
about honoring the dead?

00:47:28.907 --> 00:47:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Mm-hmm.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
many cultures that do.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And even bring back the
dead on the Day of the Dead.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways to experience.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:42.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you think we do as a
culture in America as opposed

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:44.930 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world?

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:47.443 align:middle line:90%
Is there an imbalance there?

00:47:47.443 --> 00:47:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Again, I think
it's very individualistic.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we
have as much freedom

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.850 align:middle line:84%
to express our emotions
at the moment of death.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of restraint

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that is put on people if they
have an outburst of emotion.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.635 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of discouraged a lot
in our Western culture, which

00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I think is a shame,
because people need

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.720 align:middle line:90%
to express in whatever way.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But you do think now,
there is no one culture.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And we are a conglomeration
of many traditions.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So in California, where I
live, the Day of the Dead

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is considered a very common
and encouraged practice.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So you'll find
storefronts with altars,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:90%
all up and down the street.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.370 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find that
for a good month,

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:41.960 align:middle line:10%
people are participating in
various things that connect

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.950 align:middle line:10%
them to the departed loved one.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of
ancient paganism,

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.120 align:middle line:84%
where it was thought that,
at this time of the year,

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.970 align:middle line:84%
in the fall, around
the Halloween

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:57.860 align:middle line:84%
time, that the veil between the
living in the dead was thin.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was kind of
a permeable membrane.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't all
about loving the dead,

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.190 align:middle line:84%
it's also about appeasing
the dead so that they

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.120 align:middle line:90%
don't do tricks on you.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make
sure that they're

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:84%
happy and taken care of so that
they don't try to undermine

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.930 align:middle line:90%
you and become mischievous.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The underworld.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Or whatever.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They have different--
again, there's

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:24.080 align:middle line:84%
different models
in that culture.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
You would see a parallel
world where, for example, if--

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:84%
during this time of
the Day of the Dead--

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the person had
been a hairdresser,

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.500 align:middle line:90%
you might give them something--

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.410 align:middle line:84%
it could even be a paper
something that you could burn--

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that supports them in the other
world at a parallel level.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So they're doing
basically the same thing there,

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:84%
but they're doing it in
a non-physical manner.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're honoring
the dead and gifting.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Yeah.

00:49:53.758 --> 00:49:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And celebrating the dead.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And celebrating.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: It's a
very joyful thing.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Participating in one of
the parades, for example,

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll have the mariachis
singing, and performing,

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and people wearing costumes
and dressed up like skeletons.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.603 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it much
more accessible.

00:50:11.603 --> 00:50:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There was a great
movie called "Coco."

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great movie,
and it was about that.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And basically the
message of the movie

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:84%
was if you honor and remember
those who have passed,

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.490 align:middle line:90%
it keeps their memory stronger.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.920 align:middle line:84%
If you forget, their
memories fades.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Right.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's one domain of it.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the idea that
we hold these memories

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.490 align:middle line:90%
and we can keep them alive.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
the idea that there's

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:43.440 align:middle line:90%
something more than a memory.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a being.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It is a metaphysical
force that still

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.687 align:middle line:90%
exists in some parallel place.

00:50:52.687 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This whole-- I love
this, because we're actually

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.030 align:middle line:84%
honoring the dead
when we're talking

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:90%
about it, which is great.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You just got a project funded
about the psychomanteum.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me about that?

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Sure.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're very
excited about it.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.330 align:middle line:84%
The psychomanteum
is a technique that

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:11.370 align:middle line:90%
was developed by Raymond Moody.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out of the
ancient Greek culture,

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.580 align:middle line:90%
where they would do scrying.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They would take a highly
polished surface or reflective

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.860 align:middle line:84%
surface and they would do a
kind of divination practice

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:30.000 align:middle line:84%
by looking and seeing if there
are patterns that emerge there.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, Moody was interested
in the possibility

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that we could bring
that into a modern kind

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:90%
of clinical environment.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he created
this situation where

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:44.050 align:middle line:84%
you go into a fully darkened
room that has a mirror,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's a slight
illumination on the mirror.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting there in
this room with your eyes open.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And our brains are
trained to see things

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:90%
if your eyes are open.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But if they're not, we
start to create things.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this altered
state of consciousness

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:84%
happens in the context of
the sensory deprivation.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have my
normal sensory input

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:90%
and I am in a quiet space.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And people start to see
and hear voices or things--

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:middle line:90%
little, wispy things.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.230 align:middle line:84%
They describe all
kinds of things.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And what you can
do is prime them,

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:84%
prior to going into
the psychomanteum,

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to touch base with
somebody that is departed.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there someone that
you always wanted

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to have that final conversation
with but were never able to?

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's often a huge
source of grief, suffering.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you can then
be liberated from that

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.980 align:middle line:84%
by having that
final conversation,

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it has very measurable
positive effects on people,

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.500 align:middle line:90%
on their psychologies.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So we wrote a proposal
to look at this

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.130 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
virtual reality.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So people will come in and
they'll put the goggles on,

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and they'll have a total
immersion experience

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of being in the psychomanteum.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With the person's face?

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: No, it'll be
just the darkened space,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.215 align:middle line:90%
with a slight illumination.

00:53:19.215 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of mirrors,
but you don't ever

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.890 align:middle line:90%
see your own reflection.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And you just see a tiny
little bit of illumination.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
to see if we can

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:84%
help people to move through
that grief process, to engage

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in experiences that lie
outside their normal, everyday

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.970 align:middle line:84%
encounters, and
ultimately using this

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.108 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of their
psychological well-being.

00:53:46.108 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Their grieving process.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.817 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Their
grieving process.

00:53:48.817 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this was funded through
a small foundation in Portugal

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.120 align:middle line:84%
called Be All Foundation, and
we are very grateful to them.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think any
of that is imagination,

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.010 align:middle line:84%
or is that important
for healing?

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: In this case,
it's not ontological.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're
not trying to prove

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.820 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the spirits
in the psychomanteum,

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:84%
we are attempting to
invite experiences

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.060 align:middle line:90%
that benefit the person.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's really not about proving
the existence of the spirit

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.140 align:middle line:84%
world it's really about
creating an environment where

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.650 align:middle line:84%
people can access those
experiences noetically.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a last conversation,
or an I love you, or a hug,

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.390 align:middle line:90%
or a touch.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just a mental
touch that means closure.

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Or
anything, really, that

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.390 align:middle line:84%
invites a sense of something
beyond just the physical.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.282 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you get this
funding through the Trans--

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: The Institute of
Transpersonal Psychology.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Transpersonal
Psychology.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: We did.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Be All grant
came through ITP.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So ITP was the first
graduate program

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
in the country to look at
transpersonal psychology.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Basically most psychology
is very behaviorist.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It's psychology
developed with Skinner,

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and the little box,
and conditioning.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And there was this sense that
all experiences were basically

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.430 align:middle line:84%
something that, if they had a
negative connotation or they

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
had an otherworldly
connotation--

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the kind of things
we're talking about--

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:30.870 align:middle line:84%
they were probably illusions,
delusions, psychosis,

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:90%
and pathological.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So the people who started
ITP, Bob Frager in particular,

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.410 align:middle line:90%
had been trained.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:90%
He got his PhD at Harvard.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And he felt like there
was something more

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to these experiences, that
you can talk to people who've

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.300 align:middle line:84%
had these transformations, and
it doesn't seem pathological,

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.710 align:middle line:90%
it seems pretty healthy.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it opens up to a
broader range of experiences.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:01.020 align:middle line:10%
So the idea was to create
kind of the fourth wave

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:10%
of psychology, where
instead of only treating

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.200 align:middle line:10%
people who have pathologies,
it's also working with people

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.380 align:middle line:10%
who are perfectly
healthy and want to grow,

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.390 align:middle line:10%
want to expand their awareness.

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, OK.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And so it's
really imbued with this sense

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of possibility, positivity,
kind of a precursor

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.115 align:middle line:84%
to the positive
psychology movement.

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what kind of
classes or courses are there?

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So we have a
master's and PhD level.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:34.530 align:middle line:84%
People can study
either psychology

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.110 align:middle line:84%
as a research and
educational program,

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:90%
or clinical psychology.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're training people
who are clinicians to be

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.310 align:middle line:84%
able to manage the
experiences of their clients

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:50.610 align:middle line:84%
in a way that doesn't
want to medicate them.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it wants
to explore them

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in ways that invite curiosity.

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's safe.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.938 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: That's safe.

00:56:56.938 --> 00:57:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So my students are
very interested in--

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I've got one who's doing a
project on death awareness

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and looking at physical
and psychological changes.

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm really
interested in--

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:13.280 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
aging a little bit--

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with a
woman named Ellen She's

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:18.670 align:middle line:90%
a psychologist at Harvard.

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And she did a study,
years ago, where

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:84%
she took men into
an environment where

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.060 align:middle line:90%
they were 20 years earlier.

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So she created a house that
had everything 20 years ago.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So the magazines were 20
years earlier, the television,

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the lighting, the doorknobs,
the furniture, the clothing.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were instructed
to really live

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.620 align:middle line:90%
like it was 20 years ago.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And she found that
people had very positive

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.520 align:middle line:84%
psychological changes
as a result of that.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we're looking
at doing that--

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.860 align:middle line:84%
again, using the
virtual reality,

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to
set up a physical space,

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:84%
we can give them a full
immersion into an experience

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.440 align:middle line:90%
20 years earlier.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of someone
with breast cancer,

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, we can take them
10 years into the future.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where they're healthy.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Where they're
healthy, they're alive,

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.138 align:middle line:84%
they're living to
see the new year.

00:58:15.138 --> 00:58:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so
missing in health care,

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.490 align:middle line:90%
is forward pacing the patient.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So it's kind of
turning some of our assumptions

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:26.520 align:middle line:84%
on their heads, asking
questions in a different way,

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to empower the
culture, reduce the suffering,

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately expand
our human potentials.

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this what you
did when you were at IONS?

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Sure.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been working in this
field since I was about 20--

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.580 align:middle line:90%
just yesterday.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
very interested--

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.910 align:middle line:84%
since that out-of-body
experience on the motorcycle,

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I have really been
interested in seeing

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:90%
if we can't change the world.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And I began to really
understand that consciousness

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.340 align:middle line:90%
may be the gateway.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I started by working at the
Institute for Parapsychology

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.380 align:middle line:90%
in Durham, North Carolina.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I went from there to
San Antonio, Texas

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and worked at the Mind
Science Foundation.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.660 align:middle line:84%
There, I did a
series of experiments

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:84%
with psychologist
William Braud, where

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.500 align:middle line:84%
we were looking
at psychic healing

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and we were looking
at the possibility

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that one person's
intention could influence

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.170 align:middle line:84%
the physiology of another
person at a distance,

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and under random conditions.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And we found, after
14 formal experiments,

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that there were significant
differences in the physiology

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of the distant person when
the intention was directed

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:44.430 align:middle line:90%
toward them from a distance.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as a
parent, you could--

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: Potentially
with a parent, yes.

00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:49.548 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As a parent,
you could hope

00:59:49.548 --> 00:59:52.170 align:middle line:84%
for healing if you have a child
that's sick or lost their way.

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLITZ: Exactly-- or anyone.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we continued to
do some of that research

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.150 align:middle line:84%
when I went to Science
Applications International

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Corporation.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I worked at the
cognitive sciences lab.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.720 align:middle line:84%
That was the
government-sponsored program

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.685 align:middle line:90%
from the DIA/CIA.

01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to the
Institute of Noetic Sciences

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and spent 25 years there.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that could
be just yesterday, but--

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.250 align:middle line:90%
this time travel thing.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.942 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's that
grateful aging thing.

01:00:17.942 --> 01:00:19.630 align:middle line:90%
That works.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: And we looked at
all kinds of things there.

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And one study in
particular stands out,

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
where we recruited couples,
one of whom had cancer,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and we took the healthy
partner through what

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
we call a compassionate
intention training program.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, when you
are in a relationship

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and your partner
is suffering, you

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
can feel very disempowered,
like what can I do to help?

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.318 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, helpless.

01:00:45.318 --> 01:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So we took them
through this training.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They went home and
continued to practice.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we brought
them into the lab,

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and we put them
in separate rooms.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And we had a video
camera on one person,

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and a closed-circuit television
screen in the other room.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So they were physically,
sensorally separated

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.300 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we monitored the
physiology of both people.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So when the healthy
partner was sending

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.970 align:middle line:84%
loving, compassionate
intention to their partner,

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
you could see a
measurable change

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.440 align:middle line:90%
in that person's physiology.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, we
saw parallel changes

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.700 align:middle line:90%
in both people.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So you might expect, if I'm
sending, willfully, something,

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
show an arousal.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't make sense
in the conventional model

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that you would pick up on
that arousal at a distance.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.167 align:middle line:84%
But we did find that, to a
highly significant degree.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: So we call
that the love study.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has really
powerful implications

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
our entanglement

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:51.715 align:middle line:90%
and our interconnectedness.

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes,
relationships, completely.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
A question for you-- why
do you do all that you do?

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: What
else is there to do?

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I really can't
totally answer that.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I was telling somebody
about this new experiment

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
with the psychomanteum,
and they're

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:12.887 align:middle line:84%
like, you really did find
a unique niche, didn't you?

01:02:12.887 --> 01:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:16.020 align:middle line:10%
It's just a curiosity.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.260 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the
world needs healing.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.920 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that there
are various ways to do that.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.340 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a lot of good
things that are happening.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.890 align:middle line:10%
But if we could
really begin to switch

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:33.610 align:middle line:10%
how we hold our consciousness,
how we direct our consciousness

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.800 align:middle line:10%
and intention
toward others, that

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.590 align:middle line:10%
could be a recipe for success.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that is true.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.780 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.555 align:middle line:90%
It's a more conscious world.

01:02:42.555 --> 01:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLITZ: A more
conscious world

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and a more engaged worldview.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I agree.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for all that you shared,

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and for sharing with us how
death makes life possible.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So true.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for being with us.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.090 align:middle line:10%
