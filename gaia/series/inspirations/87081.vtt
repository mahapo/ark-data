00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.264 align:middle line:84%
and we're broadcasting
from the Sounds True Wake

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Up Festival in the
beautiful Rockies

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.330 align:middle line:84%
surrounding Estes
Park in Colorado.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So most of our greatest
joys and sorrows

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:84%
happen with our
relationships with others.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Our days are basically a dance
between relating with others

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:90%
and relating back to ourselves.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.534 align:middle line:84%
If this consumes
most of our day,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be great
if you could really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
learn to guide your mind
to forgiveness and healing

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.629 align:middle line:84%
and find a greater happiness
and connection with others?

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we're
talking about today

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:84%
with neuropsychologist
Rick Hansen.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
He teaches how brain science,
practical psychology,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and Buddhist
meditation practices

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
are able to help us achieve
greater intimacy with ourselves

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and in our relationships.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.444 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:57.444 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICK HANSON: It's great
to be here, Lisa-- really.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.651 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is going to
be so fun, because we're

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.168 align:middle line:84%
going to just connect with
our brain chemistry today.

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Oh!

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about relationships.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So, every single day, we're
relating with others-- people

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in lines and cars when we
drive, with our loved ones.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you not carry the baggage
over into the relationships

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:90%
to affect?

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.427 align:middle line:84%
How do you start new every day,
I think is what I'm asking?

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Wow.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think for one, it's
natural to not start new.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're designed
to learn from our experiences.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.665 align:middle line:84%
And it would be, in a way,
odd to wake up and roll

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.744 align:middle line:84%
over and go, who
are you, anyway?

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:39.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
There would be a little
trouble with that.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think sometimes
people feel bad about still

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:90%
being affected by things.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.866 align:middle line:84%
But it's natural to
be affected by things.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha had a nice
metaphor for that-- the first

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and the second dart.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
The first dart is what affects
us in the first place--

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
physically and emotionally.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.433 align:middle line:84%
But then we had
second, third, fourth,

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and fifth darts that
we throw ourselves.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those second,
third, fourth, or fifth darts,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
especially for people who
have done some inner work,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
is that they feel bad
about feeling bad.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So step one is to let go of
that one as much as possible.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We throw the darts
back or more darts get--

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: At ourselves.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At ourselves.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We throw
them at ourselves.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:90%
We criticize ourselves.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Why am I still irritated with
my partner over that thing?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I must not have meditated
or done enough therapy,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.921 align:middle line:90%
or whatever enough.

00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can't I just let it go?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:24.816 align:middle line:90%
Like step one-- hey, I am upset.

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
to start with a kind of
kindness for yourself.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't be
really kind to yourself,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.202 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to sustain
kindness for other people

00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
because we start
feeling like we're

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.665 align:middle line:84%
running on empty,
running on fumes.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:37.229 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So that would
be part one for me.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Part two for me is
to really appreciate

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
how good it feels to let go.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Make a tight fist.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Oh, 10 seconds-- I
just wanna let go.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.077 align:middle line:90%
And it feels so good to let go.

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It starts to flow again.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.034 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So to let go in relationships--
so valuing letting go,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
realizing why it's good for
me to let go of my grievances

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, third, I need to take
action if it's appropriate.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk about something
that's real, et cetera.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But if my mind is caught-- and I
call it the simulator-- looping

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
over that conversation,
rewriting that email,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
wondering why others
didn't step in.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know,
the famous saying--

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are wiring that
negativity, that resentment,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that low self-esteem, that
case against other people,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that mistrust of
life altogether--

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you're wiring that
into your brain.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we have a
brain-- as you know--

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that's very vulnerable
to over-learning

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.794 align:middle line:90%
from negative experiences.

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the negativity
bias of the brain.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Then I say like, Velcro for
the bad, Teflon for the good.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.031 align:middle line:90%
So summing it up.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to, myself--
there's enough

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:90%
suffering in life as it is.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to add excess
needless suffering, including

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
getting all cranky
about other people.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to move to letting
go as soon as possible

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and try to find that
sweet spot between love

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and power, compassion
and assertiveness.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you do
this consciously.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Very.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I mean, yeah.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
It does--

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: When I'm on my game,
which isn't all the time.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.444 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It takes a
conscious action, because,

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:17.819 align:middle line:84%
as you just said--
and I want you

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
to expand this a little bit.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Why does the brain
hold on to negativity?

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.234 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so much more impactful
on the brain than positivity?

00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.401 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.025 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, this
is what scientists

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
call the negativity
bias of the brain--

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
tons of studies about it.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
as our ancestors evolved

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and the nervous system
has been evolving

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
for 600 million years-- I
think of each one of us having

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
inside a little lizard, mouse,
and monkey loosely associated

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
with the brain stem
subcortex and primate stages

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And those little critters were
living in tough conditions.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So they had to both get
carrots and avoid sticks--

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
carrots like food, mating
opportunities, et cetera;

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.135 align:middle line:84%
sticks like predators,
natural hazards--

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Danger.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah, dangers.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Both are important, but
here's the difference.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
If you fail to get
a carrot today,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a chance
at a carrot tomorrow.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.734 align:middle line:84%
But if you fail to avoid
that stick today, whack.

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no tomorrow.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: No more
carrots forever.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a brain
that does four things.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
One, it scans for bad news.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Two, it hyperfocuses on it.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Three, it overreacts to it.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you play
two sounds for people

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
inside an MRI, they're equally
loud, but one is pleasant,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:90%
one is unpleasant.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Wing!

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The brain reacts more
to the unpleasant.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, fourth,
the whole package

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
is fast-tracked into
emotional memory.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Once burned, twice shy.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, think
about a relationship.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.101 align:middle line:84%
10 things happen in a day, nine
are positive, one's negative.

00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
What's the one you think
about when you go to sleep

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
or when you get up the
next morning, which

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.623 align:middle line:90%
is where we started here.

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:51.206 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:51.206 --> 00:05:52.705 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Relationships,
since we're

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about that--
interactions in relationships.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.761 align:middle line:84%
Negative ones have much more
power than positive ones.

00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why the
daily news is so popular,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:90%
or the nightly news.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
If it bleeds, it
leads in journalism.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why is it sometimes
when we have a bad day,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
we take it out on the
ones we love the most.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.487 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I think it's
for a lot of reasons.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:84%
One, they're safer
to take it out on.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.325 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take it out on
your boss or the police officer

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
who pulled you over
for a ticket-- uh oh.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be in trouble.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So they become natural
lightning rods.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I think that's one reason.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I think another reason is
that it's natural in us

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.529 align:middle line:84%
to want to share our
pain with others.

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's so
important to make

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
it clear to the other
person-- I'm not blaming you

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:90%
for my bad day.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I'd love it if--

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You'd listen.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.478 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: In other words,
I'd call that-- yeah.

00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It's responsibly
sharing your experience.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.224 align:middle line:84%
This is how it is for me, and
I'm not blaming you for it.

00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I don't need
you to fix it, I just

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:90%
need you to listen.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I think especially,
as studies show,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that statement is very
useful for men to hear,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise-- again, as
a generalization about gender,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.339 align:middle line:84%
you have to be
always careful about.

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But still, if most
men don't hear

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need
to fix it, they're

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:90%
going to want to fix it.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot out of
because they're very

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
moved by the upset or
pain of their partner,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
whether they're in
a gay relationship

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
or a heterosexual one.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.780 align:middle line:90%
They want to fix it.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to put
the disclaimer out first.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But that natural ability for men
to want to solve, rescue, fix,

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
be the hero is,
again, in the brain.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the biochemistry.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Sure, and
it's also culture, too.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Culture.

00:07:30.645 --> 00:07:31.311 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right.

00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
helpful to realize

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that it's well-intended at
bottom-- usually, not always.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually
well-intended by bottom,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
even if it's obnoxious.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to
say, no, I don't

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
need you to solve my problem, I
just want to connect with you.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
That's so interesting.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
That a whole nother
conversation about men and women

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and how we interpret
each other's

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
conversations and
communication differently.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But women could look at that as,
oh, you're basically telling me

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm stupid and I don't
know how to do it myself.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Totally.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.393 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't need to
be the damsel in distress.

00:08:01.393 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:90%
So we overreact.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it goes
back to the grievances.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So what do you find is the
main cause of discontent

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.235 align:middle line:90%
in relationships?

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:12.776 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Wow.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.247 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about adult
romantic relationships?

00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:17.122 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's-- yeah.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:17.622 align:middle line:90%
Start there.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Keep it there.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the main
source of discontent

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is feeling let down by
your partner in some way.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And often it's really subtle.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unsupported.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.336 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Like you
look at your partner,

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:29.532 align:middle line:90%
and your partner looks away.

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel like
your partner is

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:84%
being willing to give you
the gift of attention.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you realize-- it's
very common for women--

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing a lot
more of the daily grind--

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
more dishes, more childcare,
more laundry, what have you--

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%
and it just doesn't feel fair.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
You feel let down
by the other person.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Or, flip it the other way.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.345 align:middle line:84%
Again, in a common pattern in
a heterosexual relationship,

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
the man feeling let down
by his partner who's

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
no longer very interested
in him as a lover,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.096 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't bring that
dimension to their life--

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
not just for the few
dozen minutes every week

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually erotically
involved with each other.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So my larger point is it's
around feeling let down.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing that I try
to do on my side of the street

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is really zero in on what
I call unilateral virtue.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, how can
I be the best partner

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I can be, within my own code as
to what I see is appropriate,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and you just zero out, line
out, the maximum reasonable

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
responsibility I can take
for your grievances with me.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
How can I give
you the max that I

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
can give you, that's
reasonable for me

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
to do it, and then do it
again and again and again?

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's good for me.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It's also benevolent and
virtuous and stuff like that,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.517 align:middle line:84%
but that's your
best-on strategy to get

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:90%
what you need from your partner.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I see so many people-- I've
been a long-time therapist,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
including couples counselor,
and I see so many couples,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
they're just waiting
for the other person

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
to make their move.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.563 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To say that wrong thing.

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, and I
think break the deadlock.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You take care of your
side of the street.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Let your partner take care of
his or her side of the street.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And things are going
to be a lot better.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.234 align:middle line:84%
And the other is, I
try to help myself--

00:10:05.234 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
this is where we're
probably going

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
to go in the conversation-- be
resourced inside myself, which

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
means changing my brain
for the better over time

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to have the capability to
really hear your grievances,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
including the
topspin, including,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
honestly, the unfair
aspects of it.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Because you're revved up,
and that's just how it is.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
To stay present with
it and not feel so

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
flooded by it that I have
to go to war with you

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
to make it go away.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You know,
there's a classic line--

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:90%
fences make for good neighbors.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The more centered
one is over here

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and the more resourced one is
over here-- much research shows

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.341 align:middle line:84%
this is true-- the more intimate
we can be with each other.

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that where your
Buddhist practices come in,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.694 align:middle line:84%
where you really learn
how to be centered?

00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I think in the
combination, the sweet spot

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and
equanimity-- in other words,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
where you're both-- you really
let your heart open enough

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
to feel the other person.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I think many, many people don't
feel resourced enough inside

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to actually let their heart
become as wide as it naturally

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.251 align:middle line:84%
would be, because they just
feel overwhelmed by it.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Or they get
caught up in feeling

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
guilty about the issue of the
other person and so forth.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So the art is to have
your heart be super open.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But to sustain that, you also
need to have some equanimity.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to realize
that your suffering is not

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:90%
my own.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Of the thousands of causes
upstream at this moment

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that are causing your suffering,
very few them, if any,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:90%
have my name on them.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:90%
So that plays.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.542 align:middle line:84%
But the broader point though,
is to resource yourself.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm
much more interested

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
in the neuropsychology
of learning,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's
really skillful.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.186 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that you're
saying resource yourself.

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So how do you-- I mean, maybe
you're overwhelmed, burnt out,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and then there's more
demands and more demands

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:90%
that are put on you.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
How do you resource
your own happiness?

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
You say that you can
hardwire happiness.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.443 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:11:56.443 --> 00:11:57.065 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Let's put it in
a relationship situation.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just use
a concrete example.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're with
someone who is feeling like

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
you're-- let's say she feels
that he is letting her down.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK?

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And so for him to
respond to that,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
he needs to have
resources inside.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
He needs to have the ability
to sustain compassion for her.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
He needs the ability to actually
assert himself in a real way.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.781 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't say no,
your yes doesn't mean anything.

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:90%
That's a powerful statement.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, for women often,
as well as for men, as well

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:90%
as other kinds of resources.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So in that context, then, what
would be some of the resources

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
a person might
want to draw upon?

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, feeling
centered, feeling loving,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
having a sense of
appropriate boundaries,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:84%
being able to sustain
empathy for the other person,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:84%
having some control of
their own attention--

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to stay present
rather than wander off.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Those are just normal resources.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Resources is a fancy word.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.156 align:middle line:84%
I use the phrase
inner strengths--

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
the good stuff we want to
grow inside of ourselves.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.779 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:05.364 align:middle line:90%
Cultivate.

00:13:05.364 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So then
the question is,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.285 align:middle line:84%
how do you grow it
inside yourself?

00:13:08.285 --> 00:13:08.785 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because, again,
studies show about a third,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
roughly, of the causes of
the resources that people

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
have are based in
their genetics.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
That means that two
thirds, in principle,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
is under our own power.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm all for that part.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll take it.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.875 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And so
the good news is

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that you can grow
resources inside yourself.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And the real news is that it's
your responsibility to do it

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:90%
or not, right?

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So then I get into-- and maybe
we could talk about that.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
How do you grow
resources in your brain

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
so that, as you go
through life, instead

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of your learning curve being
kind of flat, like that, no.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:90%
You're really steep.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
You learn how to learn.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.305 align:middle line:90%
You get good at getting good.

00:13:50.305 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And those are the
memories and the learning

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.027 align:middle line:84%
strategies that you remember
even more, because they've

00:13:55.027 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
got emotion attached
to them, right?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Really good news, actually, is
that these inner strengths-- so

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:90%
let's use examples of them.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness, compassion,
patience, determination,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
resilience, abilities, feeling
loved, feeling of self-worth,

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
feeling like genuinely--
sorry to bang

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.599 align:middle line:84%
the microphone there-- feeling
like a genuinely good person

00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:90%
deep in your heart.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the final taboo is
to acknowledge to yourself

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that you really actually
are a good person-- not

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
a perfect person,
but a good person.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yesh.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So these are different
kinds of resources.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.656 align:middle line:84%
They're also what we'd like
to grow in our children,

00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
or if we work with other people
as a coach or a therapist

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
or a health care
provider, a teacher.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
We want to grow that in others.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is the good
stuff we all want.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you get it
into your brain?

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So here, bottom line,
it's a two-stage process.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
First, you need to
have an experience

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of this inner strength,
which is usually enjoyable.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It actually feels good.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It has a good emotion.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's motivating to do it.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.941 align:middle line:90%
It feels good to feel grateful.

00:14:56.941 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to be
determined and strong.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
It feels good to relax.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:90%
It feels good to be loving.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
It feels good to be loved.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
All of these are various
kinds of inner strengths.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's really neat to
notice in the first place.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: These are
usually sweet experiences.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And then second, most important,
don't waste them on your brain.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to stay with
the activated experience

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
to install it in some sort
of change in neural structure

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
or function.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.619 align:middle line:84%
If you don't install it,
it's wasted on your brain.

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
It might be--

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.201 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so if you
don't actually practice it.

00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:33.124 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Take it in.

00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:90%
If you don't let it sink in.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:84%
If you don't take the dozen
or so seconds, loosely,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to help it sink
in, you're learning

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
from this moment of
feeling appreciated.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
I feel appreciated by you.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:90%
What will I do with this moment?

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Or, this is interesting.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.913 align:middle line:90%
What will I do with that moment?

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.502 align:middle line:84%
When a person finishes
the dishes, it's done.

00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
You have an opportunity
to feel complete.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.721 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take the time to say
thank you to your partner.

00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: To be intimate
with your own self

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as intimate with
others, to really receive

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the experience and
help it sink into you.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So the fancy-- it's a two-stage
process, from short-term memory

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
buffers to long-term
storage, from state to trait,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:90%
activation to installation.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
like in real estate.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.971 align:middle line:84%
You know real estate boils
down to three things--

00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:90%
location, location, location.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Learning, including
personal growth learning,

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
emotional learning,
spiritual learning,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
motivational learning,
life learning,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
boils down to three
things-- installation,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
installation, installation.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look
here at Rick Hanson talking

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.652 align:middle line:90%
about hardwiring happiness.

00:16:40.652 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Take a look here.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Wow.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do here if I could

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
is share with you a very
simple yet powerful method,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:84%
grounded in neuroscience, for
turning passing experiences

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
into lasting structure, useful
structure, inside our brain.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, turning
experiences into the happiness

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
or the resilience or the
other inner strengths

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
that we really want
inside ourselves.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I sort of stumbled on this
method when I was in college.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But to explain the context, I
have to take you back a little

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
before, into my own
up and down childhood.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in a loving home--
good parents, intact family.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But I was very, very young
going through school.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a late birthday
and I skipped a grade.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And that combined with my kind
of shy and seriously dorky

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
temperament-- you
know, skinny, glasses,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
picked last for baseball,
the whole thing.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it led to
were lots of experiences

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
of being left out or put down
by the other kids in school.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened to me
was very small compared to,

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, what happens
to many, many other people.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But we all have normal
needs to feel cared for,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:90%
to feel cared about.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
We are the most profoundly
social species on the planet.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
As we evolved in the Serengeti,
exile was a death sentence.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Causes have effects.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't get the supplies
that we need, bit by bit,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like we're
living on a thin soup.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You can survive, you can make
it, but there's a hollowness,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:90%
an emptiness inside.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
In my own case--
hopefully this will work.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with lots of bad
thoughts and feelings inside

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of me as a result.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Then I went off to college.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I began to notice
something really

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
powerful and interesting.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Some small good
thing would happen--

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
you know, a girl would
smile at me in the elevator,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
some guy would throw me the
football in intramural football

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.379 align:middle line:90%
and say, "good catch, Hanson."

00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, that was really good.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Or guys would invite me to
go out for pizza-- you know,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:90%
basic stuff of everyday life.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
have an experience.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I would feel a little
included or a little wanted,

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:90%
a little appreciated.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Then the question is, what
would I do with that experience?

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
If I dealt with
it like I usually

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
did, which was to kind of
ignore it, let it pass along,

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I kept feeling lonely
and inadequate.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But I began to notice that if
I did something different, if I

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
stayed with it a dozen
or so seconds in a row,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
it felt like something
was gradually

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
coming into me that
was actually good.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I began feeling better
and better and better

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and more confident.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Any single time I did this
wasn't a mind-blowing moment.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a few of those
through other means.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But the good things really
did add up over time for me,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:90%
definitely.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, years later, many years
later, as a neuropsychologist,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I began to understand
what I was actually doing.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't just changing my mind.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
changing my brain.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
That's because, as the
neuroscientists say,

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Passing mental states become
lasting neural traits.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Bit by bit, I was actually
weaving these resources

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
into the fabric of my brain,
and therefore my life.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about how we can actually

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:84%
reconstruct memories
in our brain.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.947 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Sure.

00:20:21.947 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We can take
bad, old memories,

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and can you actually really
change them in your brain?

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Oh, completely.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can take the heat
off of them, or are they just--

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.658 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You'll never forget
what actually happened,

00:20:32.658 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
but the charge on what happened,
and given the negativity bias,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
the over-learning
from what happened,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and ideas or behaviors that were
useful when you were 10 years

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.206 align:middle line:90%
old or 10 months old--

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the
decisions that you

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
made as a result of those, yes.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.909 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly right.

00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:48.316 align:middle line:90%
Those can be cleared away.

00:20:48.316 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I'll give you
an example, all right?

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.351 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So one thing to
do-- three things.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Look for good facts.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:90%
They're real facts.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
positive thinking;

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe in realistic
thinking-- seeing

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
the whole mosaic of reality: the
good, the bad, and the neutral.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And I mean good or bad
not moralistically,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
but good is that which leads
to happiness and welfare

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
for yourself and others.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Bad is that which leads
to suffering and harm.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So look for the good
facts in everyday life--

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the flowers that are blooming,
the dishes that are done.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, current
life, not in the memory.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Correct.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.456 align:middle line:84%
Or you could look for
them in your past.

00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the past,
people were kind to you.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.689 align:middle line:84%
In the future, good
facts are likely.

00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
home this evening

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.572 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a long day.

00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:32.405 align:middle line:84%
So look for good facts,
including good facts

00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:84%
in yourself-- or,
in a relationship,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:90%
good facts about your partner.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I've been
married 31 years,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to kind of take
your partner for granted.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
a useful practice.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I do this myself.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I look for good
facts in my partner,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
or I try to see them newly, the
ones I'm already familiar with.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great idea.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:50.946 align:middle line:90%
So see the good facts.

00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself have
a good feeling.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we recognize
the good facts-- oh,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I got that done.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: And the kid hugs me.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Mommy, I love you.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.535 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:01.035 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:22:01.035 --> 00:22:01.535 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:01.535 --> 00:22:02.156 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Or, you know, so
your boss says good job,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:90%
and, oh, OK, whatever.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
You get a tricky
email done-- whatever.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself feel it.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you want to get those
neurons firing together so

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you're actually having
a rich experience.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And then really take it in.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Take the extra 10, 20, 30
seconds to kind of marinate

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in the experience, enjoy it,
stay with it, open to it.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Get those neurons
firing together

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.501 align:middle line:84%
so they really wire that
experience into you.

00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So to use that--
want me to give you

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
a practical example
in a relationship?

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.006 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK.

00:22:34.006 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're trying
to mend a relationship--

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, "Rust
Never Sleeps," right?

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The fabric of a relationship is
so easy to fray, cut by cut--

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the death of a
thousand paper cuts.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, especially when
you're together for so long,

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:50.735 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:51.844 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: And you're busy.

00:22:51.844 --> 00:22:53.885 align:middle line:84%
It's a work relationship,
a family relationship--

00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't
necessarily need to be

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.159 align:middle line:84%
a mate or a romantic
relationship.

00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:57.742 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:57.742 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.296 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Anyway,
so let's suppose

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
repair something,

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and it would be useful
in the repair process

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to feel cared about in ways that
you factually are cared about.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making anything up here.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.721 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you and I are in
a relationship of some kind.

00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So I
have an opportunity

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
to recognize factually that,
oh, you do appreciate me.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.245 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, you said
thanks, or, oh, you

00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:22.536 align:middle line:84%
didn't do that annoying thing
because you care about me

00:23:22.536 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually sincere
in trying to repair here.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Did I notice that good fact?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Second, did
I let myself feel it?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And third, can I just kind of
hang out with it, privately

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
inside myself--
five, 10, 20 seconds

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%
in a row, a small little thing.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet, bit by bit, you
can change your brain

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.175 align:middle line:84%
And then, if I want
to heal it-- which

00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is kind of where
we started here.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose I haven't
felt so cared about by you.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you were mean to me.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you betrayed
me in some way.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Maybe something happened.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But authentically, truly,
you are more caring today.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You are trying to mend
this relationship, right.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
What I can do-- and I
use the acronym "HEAL"

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:90%
to describe this whole process.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.964 align:middle line:84%
H-E-A-L. So first you have
to have the experience--

00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
in my example here,
feeling cared about.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.129 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:24:10.129 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And then to get it
into the brain, installation,

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I enrich the experience
by feeling it in my body

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and staying with it.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
private, it's real.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And I also A for absorb it.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I sense and intend
it sinking in.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, if I want, I can
link this positive experience

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of feeling cared about-- by the
other person, let's say, here

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and now, today.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I can link that
positive experience

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:90%
to some negative material.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So have, enrich, absorb,
link gives us "HEAL."

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So in
terms of linking,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I could feel
appreciated or seen,

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
or at least you have good
intentions toward me,

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:90%
at minimum.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'm feeling then now.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I could also be aware
in the background that

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
sense of being let down by
you-- which also might have been

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
turbocharged by earlier
life experiences,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
even going back into
childhood when I was let down

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:90%
by other people as well.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So since neurons that
fire together wire together,

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm being aware of both of
those things at the same time.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The positive gradually
associates with the negative,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:84%
soothing it, easing
it, and eventually

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.467 align:middle line:84%
potentially replacing
it altogether.

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And that's
something that any person can

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
do in the flow of everyday life,
which I think is fantastic.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how you change a
memory and you over-layer it

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.695 align:middle line:90%
with a positive association.

00:25:26.695 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And when yo u say memory,
you really-- I know.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.754 align:middle line:84%
More the emotional residues
of lived experience.

00:25:31.754 --> 00:25:32.337 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:32.337 --> 00:25:32.836 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You won't change the
recollection of the events,

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But you will definitely
change the charge on them.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Many times you've
talked about letting it absorb,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.482 align:middle line:90%
sitting with yourself.

00:25:42.482 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take a look here

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
at a video where Rick talks
about the neurological benefits

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.355 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk more about
it after you take a look.

00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: How many of you
meditate at least once a year?

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Once a month?

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.969 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:26:00.969 --> 00:26:02.995 align:middle line:90%
We'll just leave it right there.

00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
We're grateful for
anything we can get.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is about you
in a lot of ways.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
People who do some kind
of meditative practice

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
sort of routinely, pretty
much much of the time,

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, 10, 20,
30 minutes a day,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
45 on a good day-- in other
words, people like me,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
real world-- they actually
have measurably thicker

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.785 align:middle line:90%
brains in certain key regions.

00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:27.429 align:middle line:84%
So the number one region up
here is called the insula.

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of the
brain-- and again, there

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:84%
are two of them--
that is involved

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in what's called
interoception, tuning

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:84%
in to the internal
state of your body

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:90%
as well as your deep feelings.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
No wonder-- they're
tuning in to themselves.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.119 align:middle line:84%
Probably a lot of
what they're doing

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is practicing
mindfulness of breathing.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:90%
They're getting in touch.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
They're staying really
present with what's going on.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
No wonder-- they're using,
and therefore they're

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
building, much like a muscle,
by analogy, literally.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They're using it, so they
build it-- the insula.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
The second region is
the frontal regions

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of the prefrontal cortex,
the frontal areas that

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
are involved, again, in
controlling attention.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:90%
No surprise here, as well.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They're using attention, so
they're getting more control

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
over it, and they're
strengthening its neural basis.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.831 align:middle line:84%
The third region up at the
top is somatosensory cortex.

00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the part that
basically they're

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.640 align:middle line:90%
tuning in to their body.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:84%
It's less relevant
for our purposes.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The point is that people who
routinely practice something--

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in this particular case,
mindfulness meditation-- build

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
up the neural substrates
that are its basis.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Normally we lose about
10,000 brain cells a day.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
That may sound horrible, but
we were born with 1.1 trillion.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
several thousand a day

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
born inside mainly
the hippocampus,

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:51.240 align:middle line:84%
actually, in what's
called neurogenesis.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So losing 10,000 a day
isn't that big a deal.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But the net bottom line is
that a typical 80-year-old

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
will have lost about
4% of brain mass.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called cortical
thinning with aging.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a normal process.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So in this study,
there was a comparison

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
between the meditators
and the non-meditators.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The meditators are
the blue circles.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The non-meditators are the
red squares, age-matched

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.770 align:middle line:84%
This was not a
longitudinal study.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It was a cohort study with
some good statistical controls.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
The people who are the
red squares, the controls,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:84%
experienced normal
cortical thinning

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
in these three
regions of interest,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.800 align:middle line:84%
whereas the people who
routinely meditated and worked

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that muscle, quote
unquote, did not experience

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
cortical thinning
in that region.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're the blue circles
with the line straight across.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That has a lot of implications
for an aging population.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I had a birthday yesterday, and
so, you know, it's on my mind.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a little
more gray hair every year

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, use it
or lose it, right?

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It applies to the brain as well
as to other aspects of life.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
That takes us to a
really important point

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that, for me, is a major
takeaway in this territory--

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.765 align:middle line:84%
that our experience
really matters.

00:29:00.765 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just matter
moment to moment in terms of,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
OK-- subjective well-being,
as Bob was saying earlier.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, how it feels to be me.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But it also really matters
in the lasting residues

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that we-- it leaves behind
woven into our very being.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen some of
the neurological benefits

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But how can you use meditation
in a practical, practical way?

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.252 align:middle line:84%
Not sitting necessarily
30 minutes--

00:29:32.252 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: In a cave in Tibet?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, or hours
on the mountaintop.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about--
you break it down

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.957 align:middle line:84%
into little tiny parts
of the day, right?

00:29:39.957 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Mhm.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.853 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So, first, there
are many kinds of meditation.

00:29:43.853 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are just things
like mindfulness of breathing,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Others involve a
sense of relationship

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
with spirit, or the
divine-- more of a prayer.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Either one of those is
contemplative practice.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.165 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's not one
meditation fits all, right?

00:29:56.165 --> 00:29:56.915 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Correct.

00:29:56.915 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind of a
joke, like in the gym--

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:84%
those-- what's the
best exercise to do?

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the one you'll actually do.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.335 align:middle line:84%
The best meditation to do is
the one you'll actually do.

00:30:06.335 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is the one
you'll actually do-- OK.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.641 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And when
you do it-- again,

00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:11.660 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about
earlier-- take it in.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Use that "HEAL" process
in your own way, which

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is a very natural
process, of letting

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:84%
the benefits of your own
meditation, whatever it is,

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
really sink into you so
you reap the rewards,

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.879 align:middle line:84%
you harvest the rewards of
the seeds that you've sewn.

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are some of the
medications that you like?

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.295 align:middle line:84%
Like, what are some of your
own personal practices?

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's
a great question.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I love, honestly,
just the simple matter

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of disengaging from worldly
concerns and coming home--

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.317 align:middle line:84%
coming home, especially to
the basic sense of the body.

00:30:41.317 --> 00:30:42.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The core.

00:30:42.025 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, the
basic sense the body.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We tend to live our
lives, honestly,

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.632 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of chronic
inner homelessness--

00:30:48.632 --> 00:30:49.131 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ha.

00:30:49.131 --> 00:30:49.752 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:49.752 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --where we've
lost touch with ourselves.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And so just coming back--
this breath, this moment,

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:90%
the body's here.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to
be a perfect moment.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And then in that, within a
breath or two, if not more,

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense
of just experience

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:90%
itself flowing along.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a sense of
your experience flowing along,

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
you really realize more and
more how much it's passing,

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.912 align:middle line:90%
how much it's transient.

00:31:14.912 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need to get
our knickers in a twist

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
so much about this moment,
this sensation, this thought.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of streaming along.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.544 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:31:22.544 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to shut
it down when you meditate.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's a mistake
a lot of people make.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying to not think.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.810 align:middle line:90%
You're just disengaging from it.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being swept
along by the river--

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.691 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's like right
before twilight, right

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
before you're falling asleep,
but not falling asleep.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.384 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's a certain sense
of it, and you're very alert.

00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:42.425 align:middle line:84%
So it's that sweet spot--
again, the intersection

00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:45.901 align:middle line:84%
of two circles of being very
relaxed while being very alert.

00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right?

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.677 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right?

00:31:47.677 --> 00:31:49.051 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
being caught up

00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in the river, the
stream of consciousness,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:84%
swept along with the boulders
and icebergs and alligators,

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:90%
whatever, you're on the stream.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
You're on the banks, sitting
back here going, whoa.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.051 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty interesting--
streaming on by.

00:32:01.051 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: So that's one thing.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.371 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you want,
you can deliberately

00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:90%
cultivate certain qualities.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
You can open to feelings
of compassion or loving

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.805 align:middle line:84%
kindness for yourself
or other beings.

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also open to a
growing tranquility, a growing

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:90%
feeling of being centered.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And, as you register
these states of being,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
you can also help them
install themselves

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.121 align:middle line:84%
into your brain as wholesome
traits of being, as well.

00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this has
to do with a conversation

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.299 align:middle line:90%
about forgiveness, as well.

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because when--
say you're in that moment

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and you have a really
peaceful moment,

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and then the next moment is
another very stressful moment.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody does
something wrong to you,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:84%
or the bank account
is still at zero.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.566 align:middle line:90%
You launch back into that.

00:32:49.566 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So you're fine in
the meditative state,

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:55.204 align:middle line:84%
but then you jump into the next
moment, and it's not so pretty.

00:32:55.204 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Right.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do
you carry that over?

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You mean after
you're done meditating

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:90%
or while you're in a meditation?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.213 align:middle line:84%
After you're done
meditating, how

00:33:03.213 --> 00:33:04.780 align:middle line:90%
do you deal with chronic stress?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Oh, yeah.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So people can, I think, sort
of mystify and meditation.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of ways,
it really boils down

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:90%
to it's a kind of training.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And like any sort
of training-- to use

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
a really technical term in
neuropsychology-- "Mo Better."

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, more
episodes, more times

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
in which you're actually
engaging your training--

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:84%
meditating every
day, for example,

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
or doing yoga every day, or
walking the dog peacefully

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
every day, or doing Pilates
very mindfully every day,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:90%
or knitting or doing handwork.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Brushing your daughter's
hair every day.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Walking
meditation from you.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.587 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:43.212 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:33:43.212 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:90%
So "Mo Better" in that sense.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, second, inside
those episodes of practice,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
whatever they happen to
be for you that fit you,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:90%
more depth of engagement.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
you will be creating

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:84%
changes in neural
structure and function

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that you'll then be able to
take with you, increasingly,

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
wherever you go out
there in daily life.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.807 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think it's
important to train,

00:34:05.807 --> 00:34:07.890 align:middle line:84%
to do these practices that
are wholesome, whatever

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the ones that
appeal to a person,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and then steepen your
learning curve from them

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
so that increasingly-- and I
think you're exactly right.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We've all known people who
have good meditation practice,

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're really neurotic
and a pain in the neck

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
to live with, work
with, or sleep with,

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:90%
or all of the above.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And, no.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.616 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able to engage
the challenges of life.

00:34:27.616 --> 00:34:29.532 align:middle line:84%
There's a joke saying
in the monastery-- think

00:34:29.532 --> 00:34:30.689 align:middle line:90%
you're so enlightened?

00:34:30.689 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Go home for the holidays.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:32.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.659 align:middle line:90%
Tell your family what you do.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.242 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You want
to be able to yeah.

00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:37.961 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as like
a sailboat with a keel.

00:34:37.961 --> 00:34:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I sailed once as a beginner
with a boat that had no keel,

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
and I capsized it.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:90%
We want a keel in our sailboat.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:84%
As we do our
practices-- including

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
by just watching your program,
for example, and letting it

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:84%
sink in-- steepening
your learning curve

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:90%
from Gaiam TV, et cetera.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, you deepen
this keel of your sailboat.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And research is beginning
to show you're actually

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
changing the structure
of your brain.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that-- as you
become more resourced inside,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
as you become more trained
through repetition,

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
as more of these good things
get installed inside you,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:90%
your keel gets deeper.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You can afford to go out
and sail the deep dark blue.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The storms don't knock
you over so much.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You can risk greater things.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.309 align:middle line:90%
You can dream bigger dreams.

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you do get
banged hard, you're

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:84%
going to recover a
lot more quickly.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.021 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
metaphor, as well.

00:35:32.021 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at another clip

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.380 align:middle line:84%
here of you talking about the
different levels of the brain.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: What happens if
we feel over-challenged

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're not able to experience
being fundamentally safe,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
even if we're dealing
with challenges

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:90%
or threats or danger?

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We are not able to feel
fundamentally satisfied

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
if we're dealing with losses
or opportunities just out

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:90%
of reach.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're not able, let's say,
to feel fundamentally loved

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:84%
even as we grapple with issues
in the relationship field.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the brain has
a second setting.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It moves out of the green zone,
which I call the responsive

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:84%
mode of the brain, and it
tips into the fight or flight

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:84%
red zone, the reactive
mode of the brain--

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:90%
two settings of the brain.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, in terms
of the avoiding harm system,

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we tip into a state
of fear-- flight.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We want to withdraw from what's
unpleasant, or resist it.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Or, in terms of the
reward-seeking part

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.670 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the carrot-seeking
part of the brain,

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
we tip into a state of
frustration, driveness,

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and grasping, if you will.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the attaching
to others system of the brain,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
when we experience that those
basic needs for connection

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
are not met, we tip into
a state of envy or shame

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
or loneliness or, in
a word, heartache.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the brain
in the red zone.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:90%
The body kicks into gear.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The stress hormones
flood through us,

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
including moving back
up into the brain,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and we run from the lion or
we chase the opportunity or we

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:84%
struggle with or
cling to others.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Bodily resources are burned
faster than we can take them

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in, long-term projects
are put on hold,

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and the mind, in
three basic words,

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
is colored by a state of fear,
frustration, and heartache--

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.227 align:middle line:84%
in terms of those three
core systems and core needs.

00:37:33.227 --> 00:37:34.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a brain that's
colored strongly

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:84%
by qualities of
resisting, in terms

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:84%
of the avoiding system,
qualities of grasping,

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the approach
and reward system,

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and a quality of
clinging in terms

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of the attaching
to others system.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Or, in a single
encompassing word,

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
a brain colored by craving
and therefore suffering.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who are
tracking what I'm doing,

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
naturalize the dharma.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm trying to
ground this ancient Buddhist

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:84%
psychology that's
profoundly penetrating

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.510 align:middle line:84%
in its analysis of
human psychology

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.135 align:middle line:84%
without reference, in the
frame that I'm working in,

00:38:10.135 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to anything supernatural or
metaphysical or transcendental.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
In that frame, the
Buddha's analysis,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
of course, as you know,
is that forms of craving

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:90%
lead to suffering.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does one get out
of the red zone of the brain?

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.710 align:middle line:90%
We left it off there.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.644 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: All right.

00:38:26.644 --> 00:38:28.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, so I'll have to give
a little explanation--

00:38:28.685 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.112 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: OK.

00:38:29.112 --> 00:38:29.612 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:38:29.612 --> 00:38:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So a way to think about it
is that the brain evolved

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:84%
in three stages, which I
summarize as lizard, mouse,

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and monkey-- brain
stem, subcortex, cortex.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.482 align:middle line:84%
That's a super simple
summary of a lot of material,

00:38:41.482 --> 00:38:43.940 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to freak out
the neuroscientists out there.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.873 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But anyway,
it's a useful summary.

00:38:45.873 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And as our ancestors
evolved, they

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
had to solve survival problems
related to our three core

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.670 align:middle line:84%
needs-- safety,
satisfaction, and connection.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And obviously as the
brain has evolved,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten better
and better at that.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens when
you don't feel safe

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or you don't feel
satisfied, broadly speaking,

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:84%
or you don't feel
connected or loved--

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the brain goes into
the red zone, fight

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.463 align:middle line:90%
or flight of reactivation.

00:39:14.463 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Instantly.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Or brrp,
freeze response.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Either way, long-term projects
in the body are put on hold,

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.200 align:middle line:84%
so the immune system gets
weaker, digestion goes down,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:90%
hormones get very disturbed.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And the mind, in terms
of the three broad needs

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm describing-- safety,
satisfaction, and connection--

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is colored with a sense of
fear, frustration, or heartache,

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in three broad umbrella terms.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the red zone.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that in our bodies,

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Mother Nature has evolved
as well the green zone.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
When we experience in
our core that we're

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally safe,
fundamentally satisfied,

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and fundamentally
connected and loved,

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
then we default to our resting
state, this sustainable

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.840 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium condition in which
the body repairs and refuels

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.799 align:middle line:84%
It recovers from
bursts of stress.

00:40:07.799 --> 00:40:10.215 align:middle line:84%
And, in terms of those three
needs-- safety, satisfaction,

00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and connection--
the mind is colored

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of peace,
contentment, and love, in three

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.830 align:middle line:90%
broad umbrella terms.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So much of what life's
about-- as well as

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to use the example
Buddhist practice--

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:84%
is about getting
out of the red zone

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and resting increasingly
in the green zone

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:84%
even as we deal with the
challenges of life, of being

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:35.830 align:middle line:84%
busy, raising a family,
having a career, being on TV.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Even as we deal with
real challenges,

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.290 align:middle line:84%
we can stay green
as we engage them.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that like
the relaxation response

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.752 align:middle line:90%
or is it different?

00:40:43.752 --> 00:40:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I think the
relaxation response

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is a great resource,
speaking of that,

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.356 align:middle line:84%
especially for
the safety system.

00:40:49.356 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
as we relax, we

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:84%
feel less threatened
and more stable.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it, relaxation

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.782 align:middle line:84%
is the opposite of fight
or flight-- or freezing.

00:40:57.782 --> 00:40:59.864 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it usually
comes after fight or flight

00:40:59.864 --> 00:41:00.476 align:middle line:90%
though, right?

00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what life's about
is how do you get out

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of the red zone as fast
as possible, and second,

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.670 align:middle line:84%
how do you stabilize
in the green zone

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and deepen the keel
of your green zone,

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.765 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper, so you
can stay green even when

00:41:15.765 --> 00:41:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the oatmeal starts
to fly around you.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why taking
in the good-- as I

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.130 align:middle line:84%
talk about in my book--
many times a day,

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:84%
half a dozen times a day, less
than half a minute at a time,

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:90%
is a reasonable expectation.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
That's less than
five minutes a day.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And taking in the good.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.195 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Staying with
that useful experience.

00:41:31.195 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So when you're
in the green zone,

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.043 align:middle line:84%
or having a taste of it, when
you're having a relaxation

00:41:35.043 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:84%
response, when you're
feeling satisfied,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%
a wholesome pleasure,
you're drinking water

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.450 align:middle line:90%
when you're thirsty.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have a break.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:90%
You have a break.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Whew.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Or you accomplish something, or
you're just enjoying yourself,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or you're feeling
grateful or glad.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the satisfaction system.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Or if you feel
appreciated or included or seen

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:90%
or liked or loved.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.441 align:middle line:84%
When you're having
these experiences,

00:41:56.441 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:84%
like we were saying earlier,
don't waste them on your brain.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Stay with them
five, 10, 20 seconds

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
in a row to really hardwire
that happiness in you

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:10.404 align:middle line:84%
and deepen the keel, the green
keel, of your sailboat one

00:42:10.404 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:84%
synapse at the time, as it
were-- these little connections

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:90%
between neurons.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's a
fantastic practice.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So more and more of
that is taking in the good,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and that builds the brain.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.452 align:middle line:84%
It built in the brain
the happiness factor.

00:42:23.452 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That's right.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It builds in your brain an
increasingly unconditional

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.349 align:middle line:90%
inner peace.

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:30.265 align:middle line:84%
So even when you're
threatened or challenged--

00:42:30.265 --> 00:42:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --you can stay
calm and centered and strong

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.010 align:middle line:90%
inside yourself.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You start weaving into
your brain more and more

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:90%
an unconditional contentment.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So even if there's loss around
you or you're obstructed,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you feel more and more
like you're already full.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And third, as you internalize,
again and again and again,

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.930 align:middle line:84%
little moments that
are authentic-- we're

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:90%
not making anything up here.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not looking
on the bright side.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:90%
This is seeing what's true.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:90%
There is attention here.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.190 align:middle line:90%
There is caring here.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.485 align:middle line:90%
There is respect here.

00:42:58.485 --> 00:42:59.387 align:middle line:90%
There is liking here.

00:42:59.387 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at that.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Good.

00:43:00.885 --> 00:43:02.829 align:middle line:84%
I have an opportunity
to actually feel that.

00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:84%
If we do that again
and again and again, we

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:84%
build those strengths inside
so that we can stay green

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:84%
as the challenges in
our life actually grow.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a fantastic
practice because, in part, it's

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:90%
usually enjoyable.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.641 align:middle line:90%
The green zone feels good.

00:43:17.641 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The more that we
deeply register the green zone

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and we value it and come
home to it again and again,

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
the more it's going to
sink in, the more it's

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
going to weave itself into the
fabric of our brain and, thus,

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.464 align:middle line:90%
our life.

00:43:31.464 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is that what you
talk about in "The Neurodharma

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:90%
of Love?"

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I love that name-- "The
Neurodharma of Love."

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:90%
What is neurodharma?

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, for me,
neurodharma is a made-up term.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.608 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it'll
ever get me on Oprah.

00:43:43.608 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I like it
a lot-- geek that I am.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It puts together
the idea of thinking

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
about what are the underlying
causes and conditions in life

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:84%
itself, in our
own animal nature,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:84%
coming in to an intimacy
with our own body?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.420 align:middle line:84%
What are the causes
and conditions

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:06.729 align:middle line:84%
to be found there of profound
inner peace, wisdom, and love?

00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:08.770 align:middle line:84%
That's, to me, the territory
of the neurodharma--

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the intersection of
modern neuropsychology

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient wisdom
originating over

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.120 align:middle line:84%
25,000 years ago in
the Buddhist dream

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.759 align:middle line:84%
that's come all the
way to us today.

00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
interesting intersection,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:90%
again, of two circles.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I applied
that to relationships,

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:90%
including messy relationships.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.361 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to be loving and super
chill when you're partner's

00:44:31.361 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:84%
just giving you
everything you want.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
financial issues,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things--

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.753 align:middle line:84%
Differences of opinion
about how to raise the kids

00:44:37.753 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:84%
or live life together,
or busy schedules,

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:90%
or misunderstandings.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Taking each other for granted.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Taking each
other for granted

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.391 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of that.

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So what that program's
about is the idea

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
of applying this incredible
toolbox from the Buddha

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as the modern
toolbox from neuropsychology

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the best
of both of those, applied

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.555 align:middle line:84%
into relationships in
very, very practical ways.

00:45:01.555 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
incredibly important

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:84%
because, as you said at the
very beginning, most of our joys

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and most of our sorrows
happen in relationships.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.781 align:middle line:84%
We're the most social
species on the planet.

00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And as I find that,
as people feel-- a lot of people

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:19.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're running on
empty and they're rattled.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.121 align:middle line:84%
They're being banged
on all day long.

00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's an internal
sense, if you will,

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of deficit and disturbance.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.785 align:middle line:84%
And that's the underlying cause
of the red zone-- an underlying

00:45:28.785 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:84%
sense of deficit
and disturbance.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So if you repeatedly
feed yourself and you feed

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.910 align:middle line:84%
your heart, you gradually
undo that underlying sense

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:37.860 align:middle line:90%
of deficit.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you gradually internalize
regulation and balance

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and equanimity and ease, even as
you're dealing with real life.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes equanimity
is described

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.136 align:middle line:84%
as walking evenly
over uneven ground.

00:45:48.136 --> 00:45:48.636 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.645 align:middle line:90%
That's a good visual.

00:45:49.645 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:84%
As you repeatedly
internalize that,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.200 align:middle line:84%
you become more and more
able to be really loving

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in relationships as
well as really strong.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's relatively
straightforward to be loving.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.560 align:middle line:84%
It's relatively
straightforward to be strong.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.840 align:middle line:90%
But to be loving and strong--

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can both people be
that in the relationship?

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to respect each other.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a wonderful
image of a relationship-- two

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.465 align:middle line:90%
loving, strong people.

00:46:13.465 --> 00:46:13.611 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:46:13.611 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very wonderful.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.289 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:15.289 --> 00:46:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at more suggestions

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.358 align:middle line:84%
that Rick Hanson
has in this video.

00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: What to do, right?

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can intervene
at lots of levels.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a methods guy.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a brain guy.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.103 align:middle line:84%
So I intervene in terms
of the mind and the brain.

00:46:29.103 --> 00:46:29.970 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Number one-- get out of reactive
episodes as fast as you can.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Get out of the red zone
as quick as you can.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain
is over-learning

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:39.910 align:middle line:90%
from the red zone.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Every red zone episode
makes you one smidge, if not

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
10 smidges, more vulnerable
to a reactive fight or flight,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:84%
stressful, fear, frustration,
and heartache experience.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Get out of the red zone
as fast as you can.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Second, do what you
can outside yourself

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:90%
to prevent red zone experiences.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Do what you can.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Think about schedule.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.595 align:middle line:84%
Think about not adding
too many commitments.

00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I should think
about that myself.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.754 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.754 --> 00:47:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Think about doing
what you can to create

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:90%
more safety in your world.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We do what we can.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.010 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Third, and perhaps
most important of all--

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:84%
which will be my segue
into the practice

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to do with you momentarily-- is
to, again and again and again,

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
help this vulnerable
Stone Age brain,

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.330 align:middle line:84%
which is really
older than Stone Age.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system is
600 million years old.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.970 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Each of us has within us
a kind of inner lizard,

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.460 align:middle line:84%
inner mouse, and inner
monkey loosely associated

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:84%
with the three
layers of the brain.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So very loosely, that lizard
needs a lot of petting.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You're safe, little
lizard buddy.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.150 align:middle line:84%
The little mouse
needs a lot of cheese.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:90%
You have enough.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.120 align:middle line:90%
You're full.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.340 align:middle line:90%
There's enough.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And the monkey needs
a lot of hugging.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And especially is what's
called neuroplasticity.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The capacity of
the brain to learn

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.670 align:middle line:84%
goes down as you
move back in time.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
That inner mouse, but
especially the inner lizard,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.720 align:middle line:84%
needs a lot of
soothing and petting.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.490 align:middle line:84%
We need a lot of
experiences of safety.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So the third way to deal with
this fundamental issue-- this

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is a design feature in
evolution that I've described.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.750 align:middle line:84%
The three needs, the
two fundamental settings

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of the brain-- that's
a design feature.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But in the 21st
century, in many ways,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.850 align:middle line:90%
it's a kind of design flaw.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bug in
the Stone Age brain.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So the third thing we
can do about it is,

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:84%
again and again and again,
help it land inside.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.585 align:middle line:90%
10 seconds at a time-- safe.

00:48:44.585 --> 00:48:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Fed.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Connected.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Part of.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Seen.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Liked.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe loved.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Again and again and again.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.181 align:middle line:84%
And help this brain
take in the good.

00:49:03.181 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, again
and again and again,

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:84%
roughly 10 seconds at a
time, help it really land.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Because negative learning
lands immediately.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The brain fast tracks negative
experiences into storage

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.080 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Positive experiences,
unless they're

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.480 align:middle line:84%
highly intense or novel,
million-dollar moments,

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.640 align:middle line:84%
need to be held in awareness
past some loose threshold,

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.755 align:middle line:84%
that's on the order of five,
10, 20 seconds, for them

00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to have a chance of transferring
from short-term memory buffers

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:90%
down into long-term storage.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So we need to help
ourselves really register it

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.620 align:middle line:84%
when our safety needs
are basically met,

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.940 align:middle line:84%
when our reward-seeking or
satisfaction-seeking needs are

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:84%
basically met,
and really help it

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.200 align:middle line:84%
land when our needs
for connection

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:84%
are basically met-- not
necessarily perfectly.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:84%
As Jean-Paul Sartre said,
hell is other people.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.240 align:middle line:90%
So-- but basically met, OK?

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're bringing
joy and strength

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and love into a relationship.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about compassion.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And what are the neurochemical
benefits of compassion?

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.802 align:middle line:90%
And this is great for all ages.

00:50:11.802 --> 00:50:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Oh, for sure.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:13.655 --> 00:50:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Compassion
is simply the wish

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that a being not
suffer, usually combined

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.700 align:middle line:84%
with a warm-hearted
sympathetic concern.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds kind of fancy,
but it's really simple.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you just say?

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
great research

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.460 align:middle line:84%
the shows that one of the
main drivers of the evolution

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.410 align:middle line:84%
of the human brain,
which has tripled

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in its volume in the
last three million years.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the major drivers
of that is the benefits

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and love in
mother-child relationships,

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and then mother-partner
relationships, and then

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.240 align:middle line:84%
father-child relationships, and
then friendships, and the band

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.250 align:middle line:90%
So we evolved, if you will.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We are not so much
homosapiens, right?

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.230 align:middle line:90%
The clever ape.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.259 align:middle line:90%
We are homocompassionatenus.

00:51:00.259 --> 00:51:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, we are?

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this has developed
in the last three million

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.115 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:51:05.115 --> 00:51:06.626 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I would say the
level of compassion, yeah.

00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:08.625 align:middle line:84%
Compared to like
chimpanzees or bonobos,

00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:11.480 align:middle line:84%
who are very close to us,
they're mildly compassionate.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But they're very not that
compassionate, really.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Humans are very compassionate
across all things.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So how does it help us
to be compassionate?

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's very
interesting, isn't it,

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that opening your heart
to the suffering of others

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.379 align:middle line:90%
helps you suffer less over time.

00:51:26.379 --> 00:51:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.754 align:middle line:90%
That is interesting.

00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It is interesting.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're strengthening
your own heart.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And because it's our
nature to be compassionate,

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:84%
when we feel compassionate for
others, it helps us feel safer.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Because any kind of loving
feelings are a safety

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:84%
signal to the ancient
lizard inside the brain.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Because as our
ancestors evolved,

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.690 align:middle line:84%
exile was a death
sentence in the Serengeti.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's love flowing
in or love flowing out,

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:84%
broadly defined,
it's still love.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel love for
others or loved in turn,

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:90%
that says, basically, OK.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
We can get out of
the red zone now.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's safe to go green.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's one benefit.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:52:04.653 --> 00:52:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Also, the
compassion system,

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.770 align:middle line:84%
the social engagement
system, it's called,

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.625 align:middle line:84%
with related neurotransmitters
like oxytocin--

00:52:11.625 --> 00:52:12.126 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:12.126 --> 00:52:14.083 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And I just want
to say for the record

00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:15.100 align:middle line:90%
guys have oxytocin, too.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We only have about a
seventh as much as you ladies,

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.760 align:middle line:84%
but we still have
oxytocin as well.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.551 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the chemical
that bonds women.

00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:22.795 align:middle line:90%
It's what happens when we--

00:52:22.795 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: And men, as well.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --hang out together.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

>>HANSON: Oh, yeah.

00:52:25.641 --> 00:52:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good to know.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And even in spiritual
practice, devotional practices,

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.505 align:middle line:84%
of various kinds, there's
a flow of oxytocin.

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it when we
connect with each other, or--

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Have fun?

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I'm not trying to
reduce the mysteries of love

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.515 align:middle line:84%
and friendship and going
on shopping trips together

00:52:39.515 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and the delight and all that
to just one little molecule.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's a major
vehicle of the process.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a hormone.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.445 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:52:44.445 --> 00:52:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a hormone outside the
brain or nervous system,

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's called a
neurotransmitter

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.468 align:middle line:84%
when it's in the brain
or nervous system.

00:52:50.468 --> 00:52:52.252 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
molecule-- oxytocin.

00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it
makes you feel good.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.572 align:middle line:90%
Is it like serotonin?

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.155 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's
connected to serotonin.

00:52:57.155 --> 00:52:57.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:57.655 --> 00:52:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And it helps
us bond with each other.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It helps us feel
close with each other.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can
go too far with it

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and get very
territorial and jealous

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and all the craziness of that.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But a middle amount of it,
the middle way-- right?

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Moderation.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And those oxytocin systems
are connected to other systems

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:20.030 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, like the
natural opioids that

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.690 align:middle line:84%
help us feel pleasure
and joy and happiness,

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:27.370 align:middle line:84%
including subtle forms of
just contentment and ease.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, arguably, one
of the most important things

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.910 align:middle line:84%
the world needs these days
and has needed all along

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and will continue to need
is much more development

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:90%
of practices of compassion.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's easy and natural to
be compassionate for us.

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.962 align:middle line:84%
The art is to be
compassionate for them.

00:53:45.962 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's one of the
Dalai Lama's main messages.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It could be the
them who's sitting across

00:53:51.005 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:84%
from you at a
dinner table, or it

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.760 align:middle line:84%
could be a them down
the hall in your office,

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a them on the
other side of the world, who

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.571 align:middle line:84%
has a different religion from
you, a different language

00:53:59.571 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:90%
from you, and so forth.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.890 align:middle line:84%
To expand compassion
while realizing

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.802 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
waive your rights.

00:54:05.802 --> 00:54:07.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not agreeing
with the other person

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.280 align:middle line:84%
necessarily or
approving of them.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.490 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So compassion for someone
who you don't agree with.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:12.785 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:54:12.785 --> 00:54:14.243 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just
feel compassionate

00:54:14.243 --> 00:54:15.166 align:middle line:90%
for their situation.

00:54:15.166 --> 00:54:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:17.414 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
levels of that.

00:54:17.414 --> 00:54:19.610 align:middle line:84%
One level-- I admit it--
is, you know, honestly,

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:20.990 align:middle line:84%
if you weren't
suffering so much,

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.360 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't be such a jerk.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.715 align:middle line:90%
There's a place for that.

00:54:24.715 --> 00:54:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are deeper,
wiser levels, too,

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:27.921 align:middle line:90%
of just pure benevolence.

00:54:27.921 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.336 align:middle line:90%
I feel your suffering.

00:54:29.336 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:90%
I feel your pain.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I think in the Dalai Lama's line
he says, "my friends, the enemy

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.726 align:middle line:90%
Chinese government."

00:54:35.726 --> 00:54:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Isn't that
profound and powerful?

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.578 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It doesn't
mean we agree.

00:54:39.578 --> 00:54:41.390 align:middle line:84%
We maybe adversaries
at one level.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, I know
you don't want to die, either;

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.390 align:middle line:84%
you don't want your
children to die.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that you, too, will face
old age, disease, and death.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.099 align:middle line:84%
And I can have that
feeling for you.

00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if I can't do
anything about it,

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.800 align:middle line:84%
compassion is sincere-- even
if you can't help others.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.230 align:middle line:84%
We can have
compassion for people

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
world or close to home.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't do anything
about it, but we still

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.440 align:middle line:84%
wish, sincerely,
that they not suffer.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would the ultimate
place of compassion

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:12.837 align:middle line:84%
be for those who have killed
others or harmed others?

00:55:12.837 --> 00:55:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
honestly, the compassion

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is not yet
authentically available.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.481 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It takes a while.

00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You need to go
through the cycle first of anger

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.440 align:middle line:84%
or bringing to justice,
things like that.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, and then
growing over time, yeah.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.380 align:middle line:90%
I think a mature person--

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:30.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:32.421 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --and I
don't mean an age.

00:55:32.421 --> 00:55:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've known
eight-year-olds

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:34.920 align:middle line:90%
who could do this.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.931 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Where they
could have their heart

00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:39.680 align:middle line:84%
open to the kids who
were bullying them

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.110 align:middle line:84%
while simultaneously really
developing strategies

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.209 align:middle line:90%
to make that bullying stop.

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Rather than-- that's a
better choice than victimhood.

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And it
doesn't mean that they

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.640 align:middle line:90%
go to war with the bullies.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.335 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Oftentimes
they realize

00:55:52.335 --> 00:55:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that if they get caught up with
the ones who have wronged us.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Then we're trapped.

00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck to them.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:58.912 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The cycle.

00:55:58.912 --> 00:55:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And again, compassion
is very helpful there.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.725 align:middle line:84%
You know, in a
funny kind of way,

00:56:02.725 --> 00:56:06.010 align:middle line:84%
compassion has helped me be
more skillfully assertive.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.340 align:middle line:90%
It's helped me disengage.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.180 align:middle line:84%
If I can have
compassion for you,

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.147 align:middle line:84%
I can disengage from
my overreactions.

00:56:12.147 --> 00:56:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're not as triggered.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not as triggered.

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I can act more
skillfully, including

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:84%
asserting myself
more skillfully.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great way.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
questions I had

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.680 align:middle line:84%
was how do you turn
off being triggered

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.750 align:middle line:90%
by other people's behaviors.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And that, having
compassion for them,

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.430 align:middle line:90%
is a brilliant way to do that.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you two things
that are key for me.

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.130 align:middle line:84%
One is, after riding
out the storm-- which

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:37.430 align:middle line:84%
could be a few seconds
or a few hours or days--

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:38.947 align:middle line:84%
they're like, wow,
what happened?

00:56:38.947 --> 00:56:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And you get that shock.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That was intense.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Or, you know, like, what?

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:90%
How dare you?

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of sort
through what was actual

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.464 align:middle line:84%
and what was overstated in your
reaction to the other person.

00:56:48.464 --> 00:56:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Made up.

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But I'm
gonna say, yeah.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:90%
They did wrong you, for real.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I find for myself if I
get to two places, that's

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.240 align:middle line:90%
what gets me free.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I take maximum
reasonable personal

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.770 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for
my part-- reasonable.

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Maximum.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: What did I do?

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.380 align:middle line:84%
What could I have
done more skillfully?

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:84%
What could I learn
from this situation?

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.404 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And then
second, I have compassion.

00:57:15.404 --> 00:57:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I find compassion for the
other person's suffering.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And isn't that interesting?

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We think that if we take
responsibility for our part,

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.216 align:middle line:84%
even though they did us wrong,
and if we have compassion

00:57:26.216 --> 00:57:27.590 align:middle line:84%
for them, somehow
that'll make us

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:30.075 align:middle line:90%
a chump, a doormat, a weak link.

00:57:30.075 --> 00:57:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I--

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But actually
it's the opposite.

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It makes us stronger.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.215 align:middle line:90%
It makes us freer.

00:57:34.215 --> 00:57:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the way you're
describing it, yes.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:36.714 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:57:36.714 --> 00:57:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And it brings us home
to our own green zone

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional inner piece.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And especially it
is such a better option

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.670 align:middle line:84%
than fear, anger, and
resentment, and victimhood.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And in situations-- If you go
reactive with the other person,

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:55.312 align:middle line:84%
you start sputtering and
fuming and drama, drama, drama.

00:57:55.312 --> 00:57:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And saying
really harmful things.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Guess what?

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:90%
You lose your vote.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.580 align:middle line:90%
You lose credibility.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.630 align:middle line:90%
You lose traction.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Or they overreact and
you get in these cycles.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that brain
cascades, goes into the--

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And the brain overlearns
with that negativity bias

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.470 align:middle line:90%
from that whole business.

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.580 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if
you find your own center,

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:17.010 align:middle line:84%
if you see more clearly,
you have compassion

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:19.440 align:middle line:84%
for the other person,
you speak and act

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.651 align:middle line:90%
in a more measured way--

00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --a real way, you're
much more likely to prevail.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.335 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you slow
down your speech.

00:58:28.335 --> 00:58:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That helps--
a little detail.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that they
could listen, or--

00:58:31.585 --> 00:58:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, and
also, you feel centered.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.604 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it slow
down your rage response--

00:58:37.604 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
when you're really, you
know, when somebody's really

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:40.180 align:middle line:90%
doing something wrong?

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It does
help to slow down.

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Grandma's advice
is right-- you know, count

00:58:43.002 --> 00:58:43.627 align:middle line:90%
to 10, sweetie.

00:58:43.627 --> 00:58:46.543 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's good advice
for anybody at any age.

00:58:46.543 --> 00:58:47.376 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:58:47.376 --> 00:58:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.938 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That's really true.

00:58:48.938 --> 00:58:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And to be clear, I'm
not talking about a kind

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of persona, which can
be really annoying.

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, people have done therapy
and they come home, and, yes.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:58.764 align:middle line:90%
[MONOTONE VOICE] I hear you.

00:58:58.764 --> 00:59:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You just want to
like, whack them.

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.388 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm talking about
something that's authentic.

00:59:02.388 --> 00:59:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But I do notice a big
difference between rolling over

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.859 align:middle line:90%
and just, pssh.

00:59:07.859 --> 00:59:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.726 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Being nailed, or
victimized, if you will,

00:59:10.726 --> 00:59:13.469 align:middle line:84%
by the other person, or,
bam, bam, bam, going to war.

00:59:13.469 --> 00:59:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I think there's a middle place.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.657 align:middle line:84%
And you see it in great people
in the world-- Nelson Mandela.

00:59:17.657 --> 00:59:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you do.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Aung San
Suu Kyi in Burma.

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.-- people like that.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.350 align:middle line:90%
The Dalai Lama, as well.

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:25.330 align:middle line:90%
They're centered.

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:90%
They're strong.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:27.946 align:middle line:90%
They're the real deal.

00:59:27.946 --> 00:59:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As are you.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Oh, thank
you very much.

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a gravity
to them, you know?

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: When it's
time to do that bit,

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.960 align:middle line:90%
there's a gravity to them.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, thank you for
explaining that so clearly,

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and for being the
example, really truly,

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:40.840 align:middle line:90%
of what you talk about.

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.548 align:middle line:84%
Even though you might
have those moments,

00:59:42.548 --> 00:59:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you really have a clear
way of explaining it

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.916 align:middle line:84%
on a neuroscientific
level, psychological level,

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.040 align:middle line:90%
and bringing in the Buddha.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:48.582 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Ah.

00:59:48.582 --> 00:59:49.081 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:49.081 --> 00:59:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Lisa, it's
been great to be here.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.471 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:59:52.471 --> 00:59:53.572 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for the connection.

00:59:53.572 --> 00:59:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That's great.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you would like to
