>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to create
more energy, cleanse toxins,

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:31.264 align:middle line:84%
correct your digestion, or
concur infection all at once?

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.068 align:middle line:84%
Well, it all starts with
your digestive system.

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:37.338 align:middle line:84%
Even 30 different brain
chemicals are manufactured

00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:38.839 align:middle line:90%
in the gut.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.243 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to learn how
to restore your inner ecosystem

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:44.945 align:middle line:84%
so that you can restore
your health and vitality?

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Donna Gates,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.416 align:middle line:84%
founder of the Body Ecology
Diet, used by hundreds

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
worldwide for the past 25 years.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.922 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.423 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Thank you.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So how
did you get started

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.429 align:middle line:90%
in the whole health arena?

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, I
would like many people

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.432 align:middle line:90%
that step into this world.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.934 align:middle line:84%
Not well. In from the
beginning of my life,

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.435 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't feeling good.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.937 align:middle line:90%
Digestive problems.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.438 align:middle line:90%
No energy.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.174 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was a teenager,
between the toxins that,

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, form in your body
and then your hormone changes,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.813 align:middle line:84%
my skin broke out pretty badly
and my mother not wanting it

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:22.248 align:middle line:84%
to scar, took me to a
well-intentioned dermatologist

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.318 align:middle line:90%
who put me on antibiotics and -

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: The birth
control pill was another

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
treatment and I was on
those for a long, long time

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.259 align:middle line:84%
and it totally - from there,
I really went downhill.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.497 align:middle line:84%
I developed a condition that
I always teach people about,

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.366 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know I had this
condition for many, many -

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.367 align:middle line:90%
a couple more decades really.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Which was?

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Candidiasis,
yeah.

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Candidiasis.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.008 align:middle line:84%
We, the common people,
we all say "candita,"

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.477 align:middle line:84%
but in the medical world
it's called "candida."

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.379 align:middle line:84%
How does that manifest
in the body?

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.882 align:middle line:84%
How would one know that
they have an overgrowth

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.951 align:middle line:90%
of candida in the body?

00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, it
depends on where it's located.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.754 align:middle line:84%
For example, if it's in your
gut, you can all have kinds

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.757 align:middle line:84%
of inflammation, even
Crohn's and colitis or just -

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Allergies?

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Allergies
for sure.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.696 align:middle line:84%
It just completely disrupts
the environment of the gut

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.531 align:middle line:90%
because it's taking over.

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.534 align:middle line:84%
Pathogens are in your
gut, basically, and then,

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
if it's in your - a
certain cavity in your body,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.807 align:middle line:84%
like your sinuses, your ear
canal, the vagina, the lungs.

00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:22.543 align:middle line:90%
Even the lungs.

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.678 align:middle line:84%
It will cause infection
in those lungs

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and so problems in that area.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.515 align:middle line:84%
Like you'll have constant
sinus infections all the time

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.251 align:middle line:90%
that antibiotics don't treat.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
If it's systemic, which
is really the serious,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.824 align:middle line:84%
the worst place, the
symptoms are everywhere.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:39.159 align:middle line:84%
And because these are
affecting your brain,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.495 align:middle line:84%
many of those systems
are brain-related.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.832 align:middle line:84%
Depression, moodiness,
cravings for sugar,

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.433 align:middle line:90%
again, hormone imbalances.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.471 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting every single
system in the body, so -

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And,
as you told me,

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.742 align:middle line:84%
there are over 30
different brain chemicals

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:56.977 align:middle line:90%
that are produced in the gut.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: The same brain
chemicals or neurotransmitters

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:84%
that are made in the brain
for the brain are made

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.151 align:middle line:90%
in the gut for the body.

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.719 align:middle line:90%
Like serotonin, for example.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Dopamine,
all those great things

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.057 align:middle line:90%
that make you feel good.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: All of
those that - like GABA.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.361 align:middle line:90%
We're anxious all the time.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.863 align:middle line:90%
Have anxiety.

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So this
is actually a slide

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
that the candida yeast looks

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.936 align:middle line:84%
like in the body,
which is fascinating.

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:24.905 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like little
flowers basically.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah, that's
the interesting thing about it.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.044 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a picture of
it, you think, "Oh, lovely."

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.579 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple speakers] And
you don't realize at all

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.448 align:middle line:84%
that it's one of the most
dangerous infections you could

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.949 align:middle line:90%
ever have in your body.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And men and
women alike get this overgrowth

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.221 align:middle line:84%
in their body and have a
potential to get it, right?

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Sadly,
for decades now,

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:44.525 align:middle line:90%
babies are born with it.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Why?

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:47.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, because
a woman has it in her body.

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.397 align:middle line:84%
When she becomes pregnant,
her hormones go up.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.167 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to;
progesterone, estrogen.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:90%
Glucose goes up.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.704 align:middle line:84%
That's important
for a healthy brain.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.373 align:middle line:84%
But all those hormones
and the glucose elevating

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.942 align:middle line:84%
like that feels the yeast
that she has in her body.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:07.214 align:middle line:84%
So she has an acute - an acute
infection during the pregnancy

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.716 align:middle line:84%
and when women have
infections like that,

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.217 align:middle line:90%
they give it to their child.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:11.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Through the blood.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: So our
babies now are being born

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.123 align:middle line:84%
with this infection and it's
very, very important to know

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:84%
that because you can do
something right away.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now,
is a certain amount

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.261 align:middle line:90%
of yeast normal in the body?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:84%
Is a small amount of
yeast normal in the body?

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah,
yeast is in the body,

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.268 align:middle line:84%
but it's in a totally
different harmless form.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.871 align:middle line:84%
And the type of yeast infection
that we're talking about,

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:35.442 align:middle line:84%
the yeast has become
pathogenic and very dangerous.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.779 align:middle line:84%
You know, very, you
know, opportunistic,

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:84%
controlling things, manipulates
everything for its own survival.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now, how do
you get yeast in the body?

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.554 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you get it by
eating bread or brewer's yeast?

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:49.056 align:middle line:90%
Or is that a myth?

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:51.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: See, I thought a
long time ago, and everyone did,

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:53.594 align:middle line:84%
that it comes from when
you take antibiotics

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:55.095 align:middle line:90%
and birth control pills.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.597 align:middle line:90%
I know that triggered it for me.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Why?

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Because - well,

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.635 align:middle line:84%
the birth control pills alter
your hormones tremendously.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.138 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they totally
change your estrogen.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:07.074 align:middle line:84%
Estrogen feeds the yeast
and makes them grow.

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:10.144 align:middle line:84%
The antibiotics destroy all
the good bacteria in your gut.

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:13.113 align:middle line:84%
Then you lose your immune system
and then the yeast, you know,

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.582 align:middle line:84%
change because they're
there by themselves now

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and they grow tentacles, they
burrow into the mucosal lining,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.355 align:middle line:90%
and they move through the body.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:24.425 align:middle line:84%
So they create so - and
they secrete toxins.

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:27.394 align:middle line:84%
Dangerous, dangerous
toxins all the time.

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of that is
disrupting the endocrine system,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.099 align:middle line:90%
the brain, everything.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.535 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, but the
other thing is sugar.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.071 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
a high sugar diet

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:40.073 align:middle line:84%
and that kills the good
bacteria in your gut.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:44.011 align:middle line:84%
It lets the yeast grow and
it keeps you very acidic,

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.214 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what they
thrive in is an acidotic body.

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:48.882 align:middle line:90%
Stress does the same thing,

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:51.552 align:middle line:84%
and that's just a recipe
for our life today.

00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:55.622 align:middle line:84%
Sugar, lots of carbs
in our diet, stress,

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.124 align:middle line:90%
drugs like antibiotics.

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And so all
of that feeds the yeast.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: It creates an
environment that creates them.

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:06.934 align:middle line:84%
You know, takes them from
the bad form to the good -

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.102 align:middle line:84%
from the good form
to the bad form,

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:12.372 align:middle line:84%
and it creates an environment
to allow them to grow and thrive

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.874 align:middle line:90%
and take over your body.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.378 align:middle line:84%
According to the slide, if
you have Crohn's Disease,

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.914 align:middle line:84%
then that's usually a system of
overgrowth of yeast in the body.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:22.416 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:23.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, there
it's literally an infection

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.753 align:middle line:84%
in your gut and it can
be a mild infection.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:32.125 align:middle line:84%
And, also, don't forget that
the yeast are interacting

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.361 align:middle line:84%
with their environment,
which is our gut,

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.964 align:middle line:84%
and the food we're
putting into it.

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.467 align:middle line:84%
So they're altering even the
food that's going into our gut.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.302 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
saturated fat.

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:45.873 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got
pathogenic bacteria in your gut

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:47.975 align:middle line:90%
and you're eating saturated fat,

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:49.676 align:middle line:84%
which is a huge part
of our diet.

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:52.746 align:middle line:84%
It causes tremendous
inflammation in the gut.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.815 align:middle line:84%
Now when inflammation
is in the gut,

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:58.886 align:middle line:84%
it can go on to become more
severe and become, you know,

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:01.989 align:middle line:84%
become Crohn's and colitis and
that's a very common - I mean,

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.892 align:middle line:84%
we even have babies being born
with colitis and all today,

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:07.961 align:middle line:84%
sadly enough, because their
little intestines are getting

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.463 align:middle line:90%
enflamed in the womb.

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:10.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's a
lifelong struggle for people

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and there's not a lot of
solutions around it other

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
than fixing the symptoms
of the Crohn's and colitis

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.505 align:middle line:84%
and those types of
digestive disorders.

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:20.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, the
biggest problem I see is

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:23.443 align:middle line:84%
that even though
your best doctors,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.945 align:middle line:84%
your functional medicine
doctors,

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.148 align:middle line:90%
are very aware of candidiasis.

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:30.217 align:middle line:84%
They know it exists,
but their fix

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:34.221 align:middle line:84%
for it is usually an antifungal
drug, which doesn't take care

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.722 align:middle line:90%
of the problem at all.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:38.225 align:middle line:84%
Diet's the most important thing
and change to your lifestyle

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:84%
so you bring the
stress level down.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.228 align:middle line:90%
That's important, too.

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.931 align:middle line:84%
But they really don't
get this condition.

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:45.866 align:middle line:90%
Very, very few people do.

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.335 align:middle line:90%
And then the other thing is -

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
so your doctor's not
going to help you.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Multiple
speakers] But, now,

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:53.173 align:middle line:90%
why don't they get it?

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:55.876 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more of a
root cause of something?

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:90%
It's -

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
it's vague.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, the symptoms - you
come in and you say, "Well,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.082 align:middle line:84%
I'm really tired
and I'm depressed."

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.784 align:middle line:90%
You think depression, "Oh,

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.285 align:middle line:84%
you probably need
an antifungal drug."

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.854 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it's not a
functional medicine doctor.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.791 align:middle line:84%
It's a traditional rank and
file doctor who's trained

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
in medical school and knows
all the drugs and everything,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.262 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't really know
the body that well.

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:16.863 align:middle line:90%
So those - you don't want to go

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.365 align:middle line:84%
to those type of
doctors for sure.

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:21.368 align:middle line:84%
They don't know anything because
they've only been trained

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:22.869 align:middle line:90%
to give you a drug.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.371 align:middle line:90%
But -

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, they've been
trained to fix the symptoms,

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.741 align:middle line:84%
but the root cause
is more systemic.

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah, that's
what you always want to do.

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.144 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Where
did this come from?

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:32.912 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have this symptom?"

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.414 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else will show up and,

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.916 align:middle line:90%
"Well, why do I have that?"

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:39.319 align:middle line:84%
And you always go back and back
and back to the root cause.

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And I've always done that.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, these
mysterious illnesses

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:46.627 align:middle line:84%
that are called "incurables,"
like thyroid disease or Crohn's

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:49.963 align:middle line:84%
and colitis and those types
of diseases, are they linked

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.966 align:middle line:90%
to yeast infections in the body?

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:55.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: You know,
there's not a single condition -

00:08:55.802 --> 00:09:00.307 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, you name it,

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.644 align:middle line:90%
hormone imbalances, obesity -

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:07.114 align:middle line:84%
there's not a single
condition, cancer especially -

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:08.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: That
doesn't have -

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:11.618 align:middle line:84%
that person has a yeast
infection in their body

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and you have to treat
the yeast infection.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.757 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have cancer
and you start taking drugs,

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.526 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy, your yeast
infection's going to get worse

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:21.962 align:middle line:84%
and very often the
person with cancer dies

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:90%
of the yeast infection.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.067 align:middle line:84%
Now they had cancer so the death
certificate will say "cancer,"

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
but the real cause was
the fungal infection,

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle line:84%
the fungal overgrowth
in their body

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:35.042 align:middle line:84%
that becomes very
acute with the drugs.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Alright,
so now how are yeast

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:39.646 align:middle line:90%
and thyroid conditions related?

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:41.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Well, a lot

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:42.648 align:middle line:84%
of people have thyroid
conditions today

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.686 align:middle line:84%
and they don't realize the
thyroid can have an infection

00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.187 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:49.056 align:middle line:84%
So anytime the thyroid
has toxins in it,

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:51.625 align:middle line:84%
if it has infections attacking
it like a viral infection,

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:55.195 align:middle line:84%
but also very commonly a
yeast infection attacking

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:59.199 align:middle line:84%
and sending poisons into the
thyroid, you will test positive

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:02.502 align:middle line:84%
for having thyroid antibodies
and that's called Hashimoto's.

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:04.104 align:middle line:90%
And that's very common.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Most
common in women, though.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.107 align:middle line:90%
Do you notice that?

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: It is.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Why is that?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
I think in a woman,

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.247 align:middle line:84%
her whole endocrine system is
much, much more complicated

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:17.617 align:middle line:84%
and sensitive than
in a man's body.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Multiple
speakers]

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Because of the hormonal balance.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Especially young
men today are - and babies.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:26.193 align:middle line:84%
We even have babies that are
born with thyroid problems.

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Really?

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:29.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Very commonly.

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:30.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Because of
the mother's antibodies?

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:32.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, I think
it's a combination of the toxins

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle line:84%
that they're inheriting, bad
diet during the pregnancy.

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.304 align:middle line:84%
Not just that, before the
pregnancy the woman didn't

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle line:90%
eat well.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.773 align:middle line:84%
And the babies today
are just not strong

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:90%
and healthy like they should be.

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:43.777 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my biggest concerns

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in the whole wide
world is the health

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.182 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
generation of children.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:50.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah,
you talk about it a lot

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.185 align:middle line:90%
and you see a lot of it.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:53.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah,
because somebody needs to.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.188 align:middle line:90%
It's like, "What's wrong?"

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Can't people wake up, you know?

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.191 align:middle line:90%
Our children are their future

00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.693 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't have
healthy children,

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.194 align:middle line:90%
there is no future for us.

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:04.331 align:middle line:84%
I cant believe how
people are not getting it,

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:05.832 align:middle line:90%
you know, really.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I saw a
whole news piece on this

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.835 align:middle line:84%
that you were a large
part of on your website

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.439 align:middle line:84%
about how diet has
changed the face of autism

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.374 align:middle line:84%
in so many different
children that you've worked

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:16.209 align:middle line:84%
with specifically by
changing their diet.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:17.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Oh,
it's been critical.

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:20.113 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, about 10 or 11 years
ago, I stepped into the world

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:24.017 align:middle line:84%
of autism and everybody was
completely focused on mercury.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.419 align:middle line:84%
Like the kids, you know, got
mercury in their vaccine.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.954 align:middle line:90%
And I though, "I don't know.

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:30.323 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a lot of other
stuff here, you know."

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.126 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew they did
have yeast infections.

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.962 align:middle line:84%
They had, you know, gut
problems, digestive disorders,

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:38.665 align:middle line:84%
lots of heavy metals
in their body, yes,

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.667 align:middle line:90%
but so do a lot of children.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of children who aren't
autistic have heavy metals

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.071 align:middle line:90%
in their body, too.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.573 align:middle line:90%
What was different?

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:49.843 align:middle line:84%
And I though, "You know, these
kids - all these conditions

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:53.079 align:middle line:84%
that these kids have, we
deal with that in adults."

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.017 align:middle line:84%
So I was very fortunate to start
attracting of course, as we do,

00:11:57.017 --> 00:11:58.885 align:middle line:84%
mothers whose children
had autism.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.587 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "Now, here's
what I think you should do."

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.589 align:middle line:84%
And the kids started
getting well.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:04.858 align:middle line:84%
So at about two years
of these moms going

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:07.093 align:middle line:84%
into the doctors saying,
"Look, he's talking now.

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:08.595 align:middle line:90%
He's normal now."

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.096 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever.

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:11.598 align:middle line:84%
The doctors started
moving off their -

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:13.099 align:middle line:84%
looking off in the
wrong direction

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.068 align:middle line:84%
and realizing how
really important diet is.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.037 align:middle line:90%
And not just diet.

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:18.538 align:middle line:90%
It's about the gut.

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The specific diet.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Because
health begins in the gut.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.043 align:middle line:90%
Disease begins there.

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.544 align:middle line:90%
You got to start there.

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:26.046 align:middle line:90%
Fix the gut first.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And now cortisol
production also is affected

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:29.049 align:middle line:90%
by yeast.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What is the role of
cortisol in the body?

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, it's
a stress hormone that -

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.788 align:middle line:90%
pretty, very damaging.

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It very - it does
affect all the hormones.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.592 align:middle line:90%
It alters them completely.

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But the thyroid - the thyroid
makes a hormone called T-4,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.869 align:middle line:84%
but that isn't active
until it becomes T-3.

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:52.038 align:middle line:84%
And T-3 goes into every single
cell in the body and gives

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.207 align:middle line:84%
that cell energy
all over the body.

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.909 align:middle line:90%
So we have to have the T-3.

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, if
you have cortisol,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.282 align:middle line:90%
T-4 wont convert to T-3.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.985 align:middle line:84%
If you have a yeast
infection in your body,

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:08.989 align:middle line:84%
one of the many dangerous toxins
that they use for secreting,

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:14.461 align:middle line:84%
acetaldehyde also stops
the T-4 from becoming T-3.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.962 align:middle line:90%
So we have no energy.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:19.199 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is advantageous
to the yeast

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:22.435 align:middle line:84%
because low thyroid
means low energy.

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:26.473 align:middle line:84%
It also means you're cold
a lot, cold hands and feet.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:30.176 align:middle line:84%
The yeast grow very well in the
body of somebody who's cold.

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Really?

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:36.316 align:middle line:84%
If you were, like, a chameleon
or a lizard or a bat that goes

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.952 align:middle line:84%
to sleep and gets cold in the
wintertime and you get infected

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.687 align:middle line:90%
by a yeast infection, that's it.

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
A frog. That's where
millions and millions

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.392 align:middle line:90%
of our frogs have gone.

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.394 align:middle line:90%
They were attacked by -

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:48.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Funguses
and yeast.

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Same
thing with other - bats.

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We're losing our bats here
in America because they go

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.269 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, they get attacked
by a fungus, and they're gone.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:84%
So at least humans
are warm-blooded,

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:84%
but not when the
thyroid goes down.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:04.277 align:middle line:84%
So you're more of a perfect
host for the yeast to live in.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:07.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Okay, so you
mentioned that the main solution

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
on how to attack these
types of symptoms

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.852 align:middle line:84%
in the body is going
to be through diet.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.088 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is
mainly through diet.

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.891 align:middle line:90%
Explain what you mean by that.

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:20.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, the
diet has to be sugar-free.

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think
they're eating healthy foots

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.167 align:middle line:84%
like carrot juice and beet
juice, rice, brown rice.

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:30.971 align:middle line:84%
They think they're eating
foods that are good for them,

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:34.741 align:middle line:84%
but those foods have too much
sugar and they're feeding yeast.

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:39.612 align:middle line:84%
So they're - you've got to be
on a totally sugar-free diet.

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.849 align:middle line:84%
So in the Body Ecology Diet,
we've identified all the sources

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:46.219 align:middle line:84%
of sugar and identified
all the safe foods to eat -

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.721 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of delicious foods.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you'll lose
everything that you eat

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.858 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing left at all.

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The diet - I always
forget to tell people,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.861 align:middle line:90%
it's a super healthy diet.

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.363 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be
a delicious diet.

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:57.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: But
it's more than a diet.

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.366 align:middle line:90%
It's a lifestyle.

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:00.867 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:02.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Well, it is.

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I always say it's a system
of health and healing.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.372 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
Chinese medicine

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and there's Ayurvedic medicine
and those are fantastic systems.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.343 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is that our
bodies are really different

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:12.379 align:middle line:84%
today and they didn't
really address -

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
like Chinese medicines
are excellent

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.983 align:middle line:84%
for addressing adrenaline
fatigue and hormone imbalances.

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:19.452 align:middle line:84%
That's - they're
the best at that.

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.855 align:middle line:84%
But I've brought a lot
of that into Body Ecology

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:25.558 align:middle line:84%
to create a new system of
health and healing that we need

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:28.028 align:middle line:84%
because we have really
different bodies today

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:31.031 align:middle line:84%
than people had 100
or 1,000 years ago.

00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That -
well, that's interesting

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.034 align:middle line:90%
because what you've done

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.935 align:middle line:84%
with this is you've
made it a way of life.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.838 align:middle line:84%
Or you've made it so that
people can be supported.

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.875 align:middle line:84%
They can talk to people in
your community and other people

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.943 align:middle line:84%
in the community
about Body Ecology.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You have been teaching
this system for 25 years.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah,
the five - very actively.

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.518 align:middle line:84%
Like, the first five, I was
still teaching, learning,

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.019 align:middle line:84%
teaching, learning
kind of thing,

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.521 align:middle line:90%
putting something together.

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:56.423 align:middle line:84%
But for 20 years we've been
out there and, you know,

00:15:56.423 --> 00:16:00.026 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting because I -
my, you know, way is to be ahead

00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:02.328 align:middle line:84%
of the pack, sort
of, considerably.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when
I brought stevia in,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.532 align:middle line:90%
no one knew what stevia is.

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:07.033 align:middle line:90%
I brought back coconut evil

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:84%
and everybody thought
that was an evil fat.

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:12.572 align:middle line:84%
You know, and so - but we
needed those foods and I began

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:14.074 align:middle line:84%
to bring back the
things we needed

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:84%
and teach these new concepts
about fermented foods

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.912 align:middle line:90%
and nobody's ready for it yet.

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:21.681 align:middle line:84%
So it takes five years or
so and, all of a sudden,

00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:23.183 align:middle line:90%
coconut oil is everywhere.

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:24.684 align:middle line:90%
Stevia, everyone's using it.

00:16:24.684 --> 00:16:26.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Multiple
speakers] Yes,

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:90%
you've been quite a pioneer.

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: A long time.

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of exciting
because the other day I was

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.461 align:middle line:84%
on Amazon and I test - you
know, I typed in all the books

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
on fermented foods, cultured
vegetables, and so on.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:84%
I ordered at least 15
of them because I wanted

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.234 align:middle line:90%
to check them all out.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:44.938 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed at how many
books - they're all, you know,

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:46.806 align:middle line:90%
in the last two years or so.

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.075 align:middle line:84%
But, so, that was like
a confirmation to me

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:50.577 align:middle line:84%
that we're going in
the right direction

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:52.078 align:middle line:90%
and people are getting it.

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes, yes.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.081 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've been a pioneer

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.583 align:middle line:84%

for a long time.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.084 align:middle line:84%

we've talked a little bit

about the diet being
sugar-free, first of all,

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.742 align:middle line:84%
and what are the
other aspects of it?

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
it's gluten-free, too,

00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:06.112 align:middle line:84%

issue for people today.

They may be completely
asymptomatic,

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:14.954 align:middle line:84%
which means they don't
have any obvious signs,

00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:16.689 align:middle line:90%
but they are reacting to it.

00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:20.426 align:middle line:84%
Gluten and sugar are two foods
that, if you eliminate them

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:23.563 align:middle line:84%
from your diet, your health
will improve enormously,

00:19:23.563 --> 00:19:25.064 align:middle line:90%
whether they have yeast or not.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.566 align:middle line:90%
No matter what you have,

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:28.067 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get rid
of sugar and gluten.

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:84%
Something I discovered recently
by connecting different dots

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:34.307 align:middle line:84%
of research is that
the gluten - you know,

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:38.077 align:middle line:84%
so the yeast secrete
toxins all the time.

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:41.347 align:middle line:84%
And these toxins just
slam the immune system.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why the yeast are
so difficult to get rid of,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.652 align:middle line:84%
because you need
your immune system

00:19:45.652 --> 00:19:47.153 align:middle line:90%
to overcome the yeast infection.

00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:51.024 align:middle line:84%
But now the yeast are great at
producing these dangerous toxins

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:54.627 align:middle line:84%
that slam the immune system,
so you don't have one really.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:58.798 align:middle line:84%
And then the immune
system - you eat gluten

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:01.567 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system, which
is yeastified in yeast,

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.504 align:middle line:84%
sees the gluten and says, "Oh,
looks like the same enemy,"

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:06.005 align:middle line:84%
because yeast and
gluten look alike.

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.774 align:middle line:84%
They're both proteins
that look alike.

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:09.909 align:middle line:84%
And then the immune
system attacks the yeast

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:14.013 align:middle line:84%
and you have an autoimmune
reaction to the gluten.

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:16.783 align:middle line:84%
It also enflames the gut
and the kind of gluten

00:20:16.783 --> 00:20:19.719 align:middle line:84%
that we're eating today is
not like the gluten man used

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.721 align:middle line:90%
to have before the '50s.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:25.058 align:middle line:84%
It's just truly a food you want
to eliminate from your diet

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.993 align:middle line:90%
and only be better for it.

00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:28.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So it's a protein.

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:30.997 align:middle line:84%
Yeast is a protein and
gluten is a protein.

00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:34.867 align:middle line:84%
So the yeast feeds off of
the gluten in order to grow.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.603 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:39.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, it feeds
it - usually gluten comes

00:20:39.372 --> 00:20:42.709 align:middle line:84%
in something, like a
piece of bread, let's say.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It feeds off the
sugar in the bread,

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.914 align:middle line:84%
but what it sees is the
gluten is another enemy.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.683 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's used to
fight - the immune system's used

00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to fighting really hard to
bring the yeast under control.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.321 align:middle line:90%
And then it sees this gluten,

00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:59.025 align:middle line:84%
which looks like more
yeast, and it attacks that.

00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:02.562 align:middle line:84%
So you're reacting to
this protein that's come

00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:04.063 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:05.565 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system's
attacking it.

00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:07.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What about
something like corn,

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
that's also high in
sugar and a grain?

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.071 align:middle line:90%
Does the yeast react to corn?

00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:14.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
the - no, not to corn.

00:21:14.674 --> 00:21:18.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Good,
something we can eat.

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:19.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah,
corn is - yeah,

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:23.049 align:middle line:84%
corn is pretty a good
choice except for it's just

00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:25.451 align:middle line:90%
so genetically modified today.

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.787 align:middle line:84%
You've really got to
find organic corn.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Right,
that is hard to find.

00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:33.025 align:middle line:84%
Alright, so what is the
role of the cultured foods

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:37.597 align:middle line:84%
and how does this help really
reduce candida and yeast growth

00:21:37.597 --> 00:21:39.532 align:middle line:90%
and stop it in its tracks?

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, I think
the best way to answer that,

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:45.538 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind a long
answer to your question,

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:50.209 align:middle line:84%
when we're born nature
puts an inner ecosystem

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:51.978 align:middle line:90%
in place in our gut.

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:84%
It's really important and
no one ever knew about it.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.784 align:middle line:84%
Back like 20 years ago,
I started - I was allowed

00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to discover this information
and see how important it was

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.357 align:middle line:84%
and put it all together and,
again, nobody was really ready

00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:07.026 align:middle line:84%
for it yet and there really
wasn't a term for it, you know.

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:09.796 align:middle line:84%
And so I came up with this
term called the inner ecosystem

00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:13.132 align:middle line:84%
because we have this ecosystem
outside in the world, you know,

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:16.035 align:middle line:84%
with birds eating
worms and all that.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:17.537 align:middle line:90%
You know, that whole ecosystem

00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:19.038 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's
always concerned

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:84%
about because we're
disrupting that.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:25.311 align:middle line:84%
But we have an ecosystem in our
gut, too, of beneficial microbes

00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:28.915 align:middle line:84%
and it's set into - it
begins forming at birth.

00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:32.285 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when we slip
through the birth canal,

00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:33.786 align:middle line:90%
we're supposed to pick

00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:36.656 align:middle line:84%
up all this really healthy
bacteria from our mother.

00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:38.991 align:middle line:84%
We come out in the world, our
whole body is covered with it,

00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:40.626 align:middle line:84%
it gets down into
our digestive track -

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:42.862 align:middle line:84%
which is actually still the
outside world, it just happens

00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:47.333 align:middle line:84%
to be in the middle of our body
- and we have that bacteria

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:50.636 align:middle line:84%
on us and it begins to do
very, very important things.

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.405 align:middle line:90%
And no one knew that.

00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:55.475 align:middle line:84%
They didn't realize how
important these bacteria are.

00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:59.846 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question,
these bacteria, they're vital.

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:03.683 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the hottest
areas of research right now,

00:23:03.683 --> 00:23:05.351 align:middle line:84%
taking the bacteria
and deciding,

00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:06.853 align:middle line:90%
"What does this one do?

00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:08.354 align:middle line:90%
What does this one do?"

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:09.856 align:middle line:84%
Because there's thousands
and thousands.

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:11.524 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least a
thousand species

00:23:11.524 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:90%
of bacteria in and on us.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.162 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting because
you might have a completely

00:23:16.162 --> 00:23:18.631 align:middle line:84%
different little
ecosystem under this armpit

00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:20.132 align:middle line:90%
than you have under this one.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:23.769 align:middle line:84%
And completely different
bacteria in my gut and your gut.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.271 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a fingerprint.

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:26.772 align:middle line:90%
We're all quite unique.

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:30.409 align:middle line:84%
But they're important because
they make B vitamins for us

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:36.182 align:middle line:84%
and they're vital for having
energy and for detoxifying.

00:23:36.182 --> 00:23:38.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Do cultured
foods make B vitamins for us?

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:40.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
the bacteria do.

00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:41.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: The bacteria does.

00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: The bacteria
are in the fermented foods,

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.391 align:middle line:84%
which I'd like to
talk about next.

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry if I'm confusing you.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:90%
But the bacteria - you know,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.566 align:middle line:84%
if you understand what the
bacteria do, then you look

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:57.303 align:middle line:84%
at the vegetables and other
things we teach people to make

00:23:57.303 --> 00:23:59.372 align:middle line:84%
that are fermented
and then you all

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden appreciate
them because, you know,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.742 align:middle line:90%
we can't see the bacteria.

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:06.212 align:middle line:84%
Very, very fortunately,
when our eyes were created,

00:24:06.212 --> 00:24:09.849 align:middle line:84%
we were given eyes that
can't see bacteria.

00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:11.851 align:middle line:84%
So that's good because
you look at a plant,

00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:15.087 align:middle line:84%
you look at another person, you
look at the walls or something,

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:16.923 align:middle line:84%
and all we would
see is bacteria.

00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:18.791 align:middle line:90%
Like I couldn't even see you.

00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:20.293 align:middle line:90%
I would just this shape.

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:22.862 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't tell that
you had brown eyes and,

00:24:22.862 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:90%
you know, beautiful smile.

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:27.433 align:middle line:84%
I'd just see this
massive wiggly shapes.

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:30.369 align:middle line:84%
And so, fortunately,
we can see color,

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:32.004 align:middle line:84%
we can see each other;
it's a big deal.

00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:35.741 align:middle line:84%
And - but then the other side
of that is that when you look

00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:37.243 align:middle line:90%
at something fermented,

00:24:37.243 --> 00:24:39.879 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize there's a
whole lot of great bacteria

00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:42.949 align:middle line:84%
in there and, of course,
we know nothing about what

00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:90%
that bacteria's doing.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, in
the Western culture,

00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:49.422 align:middle line:84%
we are not as familiar with
fermented foods as we could be

00:24:49.422 --> 00:24:52.792 align:middle line:84%
and so you have really brought
and introduced the concept

00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:55.361 align:middle line:84%
into the Western
culture in a huge way.

00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:58.898 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to wrap your
head around sometimes.

00:24:58.898 --> 00:25:02.668 align:middle line:84%
When I've tried to figure it out
- so I wanted you to bring them,

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:90%
which these are beautiful.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.671 align:middle line:84%
You just did these
last night, right?

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
this one I made last week

00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:08.674 align:middle line:90%
and it's ready to eat.

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.176 align:middle line:84%
And this one I made
yesterday, so it needs a week

00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:11.677 align:middle line:90%
and then you can eat it.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So it
takes about a week for -

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: A
week to ferment, yeah.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
what does that mean?

00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:17.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: What does
it mean to ferment it?

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:20.586 align:middle line:84%
Oh, okay. Now, they are
made from vegetables.

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:24.724 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case, cabbage
and there's a pepper in there

00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:27.226 align:middle line:84%
and red pepper and
onions and so on.

00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:29.362 align:middle line:84%
In this green one,
I put in cucumber

00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:31.163 align:middle line:84%
and the sea vegetable
called wakame,

00:25:31.163 --> 00:25:33.232 align:middle line:90%
and lots of green cabbage.

00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:38.104 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so they sit there and,
because these vegetables came

00:25:38.104 --> 00:25:40.339 align:middle line:84%
in from the garden,
they're actually coated

00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:43.175 align:middle line:90%
with bacteria that we can't see.

00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:47.847 align:middle line:84%
These bacteria are in a special
relationship with each other.

00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:50.349 align:middle line:84%
This is something so
important to understand.

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:53.085 align:middle line:84%
Probiotics are hot and your
doctor and everybody else,

00:25:53.085 --> 00:25:57.923 align:middle line:84%
every article you read, will say
go get a probiotic, you know.

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:02.228 align:middle line:84%
But the bacteria on -
these are way more powerful

00:26:02.228 --> 00:26:06.499 align:middle line:84%
than a probiotic because
this cabbage, for example,

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:10.036 align:middle line:84%
is growing in the garden and
from a tiny seed bacteria begin

00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:11.671 align:middle line:84%
to grow on the, you
know, cabbage.

00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:84%
And then as the cabbage grew up,
these bacteria started changing

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:18.744 align:middle line:84%
and growing and relating
to each other

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.847 align:middle line:84%
and they form this amazing
symbiotic relationship that's

00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything human
beings can ever figure out.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.452 align:middle line:84%
So you bring the cabbage
in, you shred it up,

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:29.622 align:middle line:84%
you pack it in a jar and wait
a week and start eating it,

00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:33.259 align:middle line:84%
you have this extraordinary
wisdom of nature and, well,

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:36.929 align:middle line:84%
we're quite a ways from figuring
out why these work so well.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.998 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I mentioned before,
they make these vitamins

00:26:38.998 --> 00:26:42.501 align:middle line:84%
and Vitamin K. These
bacteria keep the gut clean.

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:44.637 align:middle line:84%
They have to live in
a clean environment.

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:48.407 align:middle line:84%
So the whole entire
intestinal tract is kept clean.

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:50.743 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, then
so is your liver,

00:26:50.743 --> 00:26:53.112 align:middle line:84%
so is every single cell
everywhere in your body,

00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:56.482 align:middle line:84%
and that is one of the secrets
to health and to longevity

00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:58.818 align:middle line:90%
and to growing old very slowly.

00:26:58.818 --> 00:27:01.787 align:middle line:84%
Because clean cells that
are well-nourished - also,

00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:05.925 align:middle line:84%
you eat these foods - so you're
going to eat them in your meal

00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:09.795 align:middle line:84%
and you're eating other things,
too, vegetables, fish, whatever,

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:13.532 align:middle line:84%
now the bacteria are traveling
through your digestive tract

00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:16.569 align:middle line:84%
with that food, acting
upon it, breaking it down,

00:27:16.569 --> 00:27:19.672 align:middle line:84%
breaking down the proteins
into amino acids and fats

00:27:19.672 --> 00:27:21.907 align:middle line:84%
and fatty acids, and they're
pulling out the minerals

00:27:21.907 --> 00:27:24.043 align:middle line:84%
and holding onto
them so they can get

00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:25.544 align:middle line:84%
out into the cells
and everything.

00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
They're just doing
all this great stuff.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.883 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have this
nice quiet digestive tract, too.

00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:32.384 align:middle line:90%
It's not all gassy and bloated

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.987 align:middle line:84%
like when people
deal with that today.

00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:36.489 align:middle line:90%
And so -

00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It doesn't
reduce the acidity in the body?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.492 align:middle line:90%
In the digestive tract as well?

00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:42.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, actually,
the food itself is acidic

00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:44.296 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy kind of way.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:46.565 align:middle line:90%
Lactic acid bacteria.

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:90%
But they're - they're breaking

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:50.803 align:middle line:84%
down the food, which
is essential.

00:27:50.803 --> 00:27:52.571 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why eat food
if you can't digest it?

00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:54.073 align:middle line:90%
It just becomes a toxin.

00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:56.342 align:middle line:84%
And then they're traveling
through your digestive tract,

00:27:56.342 --> 00:27:59.145 align:middle line:84%
keeping that inner world
always, if you're eating them

00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:00.646 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis like I do,

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:02.148 align:middle line:84%
they'll always keep
your gut clean.

00:28:02.148 --> 00:28:06.085 align:middle line:84%
Well, that shows up everywhere,
in your energy, in your skin,

00:28:06.085 --> 00:28:10.456 align:middle line:84%
you know, like your - I'm
66 now and I have tiny bits

00:28:10.456 --> 00:28:13.926 align:middle line:84%
of gray hair, like a few strands
here and there, and I expected

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:16.529 align:middle line:84%
to turn gray sooner,
but it's not happening.

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:19.165 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, because I
have minerals in my body.

00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:20.733 align:middle line:84%
When I go get tested
for nutrients,

00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ever lacking anything.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:23.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow,
absolutely huge.

00:28:23.836 --> 00:28:25.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: And
this is what I do.

00:28:25.337 --> 00:28:26.839 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do the diet and
I do these fermented foods

00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:29.375 align:middle line:90%
and I believe in clonics.

00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:32.578 align:middle line:84%
You know, we teach about
that and, you know, so on.

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:34.947 align:middle line:84%
But it works, I guess
is what I'm saying.

00:28:34.947 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now, you
take the cultured starter,

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of important.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how that works in
the cultured food process.

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:41.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: This is good.

00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you mentioned that
because all those bacteria

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.426 align:middle line:84%
and yeast and everything
from the garden - good yeast,

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:48.928 align:middle line:90%
not bad ones, but good yeast -

00:28:48.928 --> 00:28:50.429 align:middle line:84%
are on that head
of cabbage, right.

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:53.866 align:middle line:84%
Or carrots or garlic or onions,
whatever you're shredding up.

00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:56.669 align:middle line:84%
You pack them in the jar and
they've got bacteria, but,

00:28:56.669 --> 00:29:00.606 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to add extra
bacteria, which is what I teach,

00:29:00.606 --> 00:29:03.576 align:middle line:84%
I have people put in
this bacteria right here,

00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:05.077 align:middle line:90%
which is called plantarum.

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:06.579 align:middle line:90%
And plantarum is like one

00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
of those magical,
magical bacterias.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.382 align:middle line:84%
It does so many things, I
won't even go into that.

00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:13.452 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
plantarum does is if you have

00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:15.187 align:middle line:84%
to take an antibiotic,
and people will,

00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:16.689 align:middle line:90%
you know, from time to time.

00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:19.291 align:middle line:84%
And antibiotics, I used to
think they were really bad.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.794 align:middle line:84%
They told me it messed up
my body because I took them

00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
for so long, but they've
also saved millions

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:90%
of people's lives.

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.333 align:middle line:90%
They're here to stay.

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:28.834 align:middle line:90%
But they kill all the bacteria

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.936 align:middle line:84%
in your gut unless you have a
lot of plantarum living there

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:84%
and then they don't destroy
the plantarum so you can't get

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:35.908 align:middle line:90%
that overgrowth of yeast

00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:38.277 align:middle line:84%
that then spreads
systemically through your body.

00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:39.778 align:middle line:90%
And it's a big deal.

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they do
other things, too.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.249 align:middle line:90%
They're antiviral.

00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:46.151 align:middle line:84%
There's - in plants -
like, we're really big

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:84%
on people eating a
lot of plant foods.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.856 align:middle line:84%
Eighty percent of our
diet is plant foods.

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:54.193 align:middle line:84%
But plant foods - all foods have
a positive and negative side

00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.962 align:middle line:84%
to them, what I call
a front and back.

00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:59.231 align:middle line:84%
Plant foods have
poisons in them,

00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:01.667 align:middle line:90%
like oxalates, for example.

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:03.502 align:middle line:84%
Well these guys are
oxalate eaters.

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:05.471 align:middle line:84%
Plantarum's a great
oxalate eater.

00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:08.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So if you were
to just have a jar of cabbage

00:30:08.374 --> 00:30:10.743 align:middle line:84%
and you left it in
a jar for a week,

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:14.413 align:middle line:84%
it would most likely mold unless
you put in the cultured starter.

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:15.915 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:30:15.915 --> 00:30:17.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: If
you do it right

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:18.918 align:middle line:84%
and keep the air
out, it won't mold.

00:30:18.918 --> 00:30:20.419 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question, too.

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:21.921 align:middle line:84%
People say they go to
the trouble, you know,

00:30:21.921 --> 00:30:23.422 align:middle line:84%
shredding the vegetables
and pack them into jars.

00:30:23.422 --> 00:30:24.924 align:middle line:90%
It's not that much trouble.

00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:27.293 align:middle line:84%
They make them, right, and it's
time to eat them and they think,

00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:28.794 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, my God, what
if they're spoiled

00:30:28.794 --> 00:30:30.462 align:middle line:90%
and I die from eating these?"

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:32.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It
sat out on a counter

00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:33.666 align:middle line:90%
for a week [multiple speakers] -

00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:35.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:36.669 align:middle line:84%
It could be spoiled
and I could die.

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:38.237 align:middle line:90%
We get calls like that.

00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:40.172 align:middle line:84%
So, fortunately, there's
lots more information

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:43.742 align:middle line:84%
in YouTube videos so people
don't call so much anymore, but,

00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:48.547 align:middle line:84%
yes, if it's a beautiful bright
color, for sure it's fermented.

00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:50.049 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:52.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: If it - but if you
left a piece of fruit in a jar

00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:53.886 align:middle line:84%
for a week, it would
definitely -

00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:55.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: You
don't ferment fruit.

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:57.723 align:middle line:84%
[Multiple speakers] Because,
like, grapes turn into wine.

00:30:57.723 --> 00:30:59.224 align:middle line:90%
Fruit turns into alcohol.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: But it also grows
fungus because of the sugar.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: It does,
and here's the thing.

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:05.764 align:middle line:90%
This is important to say, too.

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:07.566 align:middle line:84%
There are different
types of fermentation.

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:11.103 align:middle line:84%
There's wild fermentation,
so if you're making beer,

00:31:11.103 --> 00:31:14.039 align:middle line:84%
if you're making wine, if
you're making sourdough bread,

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:16.508 align:middle line:84%
if you're making kombucha, which
everybody thinks is healthy

00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:20.946 align:middle line:84%
and it's not for maybe people -
not for anyone with candidiasis.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh,
because it's a fungus.

00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:24.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Well,

00:31:24.316 --> 00:31:28.053 align:middle line:84%
what happens is those are all
examples of wild fermentation.

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:32.725 align:middle line:84%
So that means the yeast from
the air are getting in there

00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:35.327 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
that wild yeast.

00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:38.063 align:middle line:84%
That's another yeast that
when you get it in your body,

00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:42.334 align:middle line:84%
your immune system says
it's an enemy and it reacts.

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:43.836 align:middle line:84%
And usually they
give you a lot -

00:31:43.836 --> 00:31:46.872 align:middle line:84%
like kombucha gives people
a lot of gas and bloating.

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:48.374 align:middle line:84%
The type of fermentation
I'm talking

00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:50.776 align:middle line:90%
about is all the fermentation

00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:52.778 align:middle line:84%
where you've got a
specific bacteria

00:31:52.778 --> 00:31:55.714 align:middle line:90%
and your inoculating that food.

00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:57.449 align:middle line:90%
Another example is miso.

00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:01.453 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Japan, for example,
they inoculate the soybeans

00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:07.893 align:middle line:84%
with a bacteria that turn those
beans over the next three months

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.561 align:middle line:84%
or six months or
sometimes even years.

00:32:09.561 --> 00:32:13.232 align:middle line:84%
They turn them into - they
ferment it and break it down

00:32:13.232 --> 00:32:15.834 align:middle line:84%
and totally turn it into a
different food that's now safe.

00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:18.337 align:middle line:84%
Soy is not safe, but
soy fermented is.

00:32:18.337 --> 00:32:21.707 align:middle line:84%
Natto is another -
popular among the Japanese

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.542 align:middle line:84%
and I highly recommend
it for people.

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:27.379 align:middle line:84%
If you're anywhere
near a Japanese market,

00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:30.182 align:middle line:84%
go buy some natto
because a spoonful

00:32:30.182 --> 00:32:33.952 align:middle line:84%
of natto everyday is
off the charts powerful.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: What is it?

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:36.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, it's
another fermented soy bean

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:40.459 align:middle line:84%
where this is a different
bacteria called natto bacillus.

00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:43.328 align:middle line:84%
Natto bacillus is so strong,
you can put a whole bunch of it

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:47.332 align:middle line:84%
in an autoclave and sterilize
it for 15 minutes and open it up

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.901 align:middle line:84%
and all that good
bacteria is left.

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:52.604 align:middle line:84%
It's a very funny food
because if you beat it,

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.908 align:middle line:84%
it starts to get these long
strands - strains, strands,

00:32:55.908 --> 00:32:59.144 align:middle line:84%
I guess you call them - and
that's actually a biofilm

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.979 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you
can't destroy natto

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.648 align:middle line:84%
because it's made
its own biofilm.

00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:06.151 align:middle line:84%
It's like surrounded itself
in this polysacroid wall

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.887 align:middle line:84%
that an antibiotic can't
get in and kill it.

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:10.823 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can kill it.

00:33:10.823 --> 00:33:12.724 align:middle line:84%
It's a great, great,
great bacteria.

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:14.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So now, in terms
of the soy beans, though,

00:33:14.293 --> 00:33:16.195 align:middle line:84%
do you get a high
amount of estrogen?

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:84%
When you culture it, does
it balance that out at all?

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:22.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: No, it would
be a good food for women to eat

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's a healthy
source of estrogen.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.473 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
another whole show

00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:31.276 align:middle line:84%
because what's the
problem is that -

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.679 align:middle line:84%
it's not that we're eating
the foods that make estrogen.

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:37.182 align:middle line:84%
It's the wrong kind of estrogen
because different things happen

00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:40.586 align:middle line:84%
in your body, particular as
we age, when you eat wrong.

00:33:40.586 --> 00:33:43.388 align:middle line:84%
Hormones, like testosterone,
I'll just use that one.

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:46.925 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone enzyme comes along
and acts on the testosterone

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:50.929 align:middle line:84%
and turns it into a type
of estrogen called estrone.

00:33:50.929 --> 00:33:53.565 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
causes cancer.

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't that
estrogen is bad.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.937 align:middle line:84%
I want to clear that up because
there's so much misunderstanding

00:33:58.937 --> 00:34:00.606 align:middle line:90%
about the hormones and -

00:34:00.606 --> 00:34:02.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's a
complicated system, yes.

00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:03.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: You
know, I thought so, too.

00:34:03.642 --> 00:34:07.045 align:middle line:84%
Like I was getting an advanced
certification in endocrinology

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.647 align:middle line:84%
through [inaudible] right
now and I started, you know,

00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:11.216 align:middle line:84%
taking all these modules and
I was like, "Oh, my gosh,

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:12.751 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'll
ever master this."

00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:14.253 align:middle line:90%
But after awhile you do.

00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:17.622 align:middle line:84%
It all starts clicking and
this probably seems complicated

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.124 align:middle line:84%
to people, but if
you just do it.

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:21.727 align:middle line:84%
You know, I try to
simplify it for people

00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:23.228 align:middle line:90%
and it is very simple.

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:26.231 align:middle line:84%
We have a real simple chart
that people can follow

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:28.566 align:middle line:90%
that shows you how simple it is.

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:31.937 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to know
this, you know, like, again,

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:34.807 align:middle line:84%
I sit in all these modules with
all this great research taught

00:34:34.807 --> 00:34:37.376 align:middle line:84%
by fantastic functional
medicine doctors

00:34:37.376 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:84%
and all the time it validates
what I've been teaching

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:42.481 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:43.981 align:middle line:84%
It's like the research
of today is saying,

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.484 align:middle line:90%
"This is what you do."

00:34:45.484 --> 00:34:47.419 align:middle line:90%
So I'm grateful for that.

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:48.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: This
is how you get to it.

00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:51.657 align:middle line:84%
Alright, well we have a video of
Donna making the cultured foods

00:34:51.657 --> 00:34:53.191 align:middle line:90%
that you can just get an idea

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of what it looks
like in the kitchen.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.395 align:middle line:90%
So take a look.

00:34:56.395 --> 00:34:58.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Now, what we're
going to do is very, very noisy

00:34:58.664 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:84%
and we've done some of this
ahead of time, but we're going

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:04.603 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and just put
in a little bit of cabbage.

00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:07.506 align:middle line:84%
I've already got some
shredded to save time here.

00:35:07.506 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
And if you're using
something like this,

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:12.578 align:middle line:84%
you have to cut your
cabbage kind of small.

00:35:12.578 --> 00:35:16.114 align:middle line:84%
But in the Robot Coupe you can
put big chunks of cabbage in.

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:20.953 align:middle line:84%
And just push it through
the food processor.

00:35:20.953 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:84%
[Background noise]
What I've done is I put

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.423 align:middle line:84%
in the blade beyond - it's
like a shredding blade,

00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:25.924 align:middle line:90%
so it's sitting up on a post

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and there's a shredding
blade on the top.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.862 align:middle line:84%
You can get different
size shredding blades

00:35:29.862 --> 00:35:33.632 align:middle line:84%
and you can make your cultured
vegetables be as finely shredded

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit coarser.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
are very opinionated

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.239 align:middle line:84%
about their cultured
vegetables and some people

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:43.308 align:middle line:84%
like them juicier, some
people like them drier,

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:47.412 align:middle line:84%
some people like them finely
shredded or coarsely shredded,

00:35:47.412 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:84%
but you can control
that yourself.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:52.417 align:middle line:84%
>> My son, my own son,
likes them chopped

00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:56.388 align:middle line:84%
so I don't even use
[multiple speakers] -

00:35:56.388 --> 00:35:57.889 align:middle line:90%
[ Background noise ]

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:00.559 align:middle line:90%
[ Multiple speakers ]

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:02.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: That's what
a mom will do for her child.

00:36:02.394 --> 00:36:04.329 align:middle line:90%
[ Background noise ]

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.332 align:middle line:84%
But often times I'll use a
simple recipe of three heads

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:14.172 align:middle line:84%
of green cabbage, three
bunches of keel, six carrots,

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:19.745 align:middle line:84%
and then a lot of times
I'll put in red pepper.

00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, because people -

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.549 align:middle line:84%
some people like that
spicy salsa flavor,

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:27.052 align:middle line:90%
you can add different peppers.

00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:30.856 align:middle line:84%
Like some of the peppers
are very, very hot and spicy

00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:32.357 align:middle line:90%
and some are much milder.

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the seeds that you
have to watch out for.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.062 align:middle line:84%
Like if you put the
seeds in, they're going

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:38.997 align:middle line:90%
to be really hot and spicy.

00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:41.433 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of fun, you
know, peppers on the market

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.569 align:middle line:90%
and that's a good possibility.

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.405 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
do that today.

00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:49.374 align:middle line:84%
>> We should say that every
time you ferment something,

00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:53.011 align:middle line:84%
it really enhances the flavor
and so, if you are going

00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:56.882 align:middle line:84%
to add peppers, you
really don't need a lot.

00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:59.518 align:middle line:90%
A little goes a long way.

00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:01.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: That's true.

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:05.157 align:middle line:84%
Another thing to talk about,
too, probably, is garlic.

00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Garlic is another one of those
vegetables, if you put it in,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.197 align:middle line:84%
a little bit will really
strongly flavor the whole -

00:37:12.197 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle line:84%
flavor will dominate with the
garlic if you use too much.

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:16.635 align:middle line:90%
Even two or three cloves

00:37:16.635 --> 00:37:19.071 align:middle line:84%
for three cabbage
heads would be plenty.

00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:20.706 align:middle line:90%
And I put the whole clove in.

00:37:20.706 --> 00:37:24.543 align:middle line:84%
But one thing about garlic
is it is an inhibiter

00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:26.578 align:middle line:84%
of the [inaudible]
microflora so it will slow

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:84%
down the fermentation
process a little bit.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:32.884 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is
it will take longer to ferment

00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:34.386 align:middle line:84%
if you have garlic
in your batch?

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:36.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: I just
don't think you'll end

00:37:36.922 --> 00:37:39.858 align:middle line:84%
up with a product that has
quite as much microflora in it.

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:43.195 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we're going
for is a product with a lot

00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:44.696 align:middle line:90%
of good beneficial bacteria.

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:49.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, garlic actually,
for me, makes it taste a lot,

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:52.237 align:middle line:84%
too strong, and so I
really don't use garlic.

00:37:52.237 --> 00:37:55.841 align:middle line:84%
So I know garlic is very
healthy, but that's really good

00:37:55.841 --> 00:37:57.476 align:middle line:84%
to learn that you
don't really need it.

00:37:57.476 --> 00:37:58.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: No,
it's good, though.

00:37:58.977 --> 00:38:00.479 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's good for you.

00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It really also - it's
going to change the flavor.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.749 align:middle line:84%
So we want - no matter
what you make,

00:38:03.749 --> 00:38:05.384 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be good for you.

00:38:05.384 --> 00:38:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So we want people to enjoy
their finished product

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.622 align:middle line:90%
so they really do eat these.

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:14.092 align:middle line:84%
They're very sour and we're
not used to the sour flavor.

00:38:14.092 --> 00:38:18.964 align:middle line:84%
We're used to having sweet
and salty in our country here,

00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:22.667 align:middle line:84%
but sour's a very important
flavor to introduce into a meal.

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:26.772 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the sour
flavor, it stimulates digestion,

00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:29.207 align:middle line:84%
but it also dampens
your desire for sweets.

00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:30.976 align:middle line:84%
So you won't find
yourself overeating.

00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I have
been forever trying

00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:36.481 align:middle line:84%
to demystify cultured foods
because it makes so much sense

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:37.983 align:middle line:90%
that they're so good for you,

00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:39.484 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
how to make them.

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:40.986 align:middle line:90%
So that helped a little bit.

00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:43.555 align:middle line:84%
And I came to your house one
day because I really wanted

00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:46.057 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to do
this, and it was easy.

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.993 align:middle line:90%
So explain - yeah, so -

00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:49.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Okay, just
think of three simple steps.

00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Step Number One,
you've got to shred

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.666 align:middle line:84%
up whatever vegetables you
want and I have great recipes.

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:57.936 align:middle line:84%
After all the years of making
some pretty crummy batches,

00:38:57.936 --> 00:38:59.738 align:middle line:84%
you know, that I -
I've really discovered

00:38:59.738 --> 00:39:01.273 align:middle line:90%
that simple is better.

00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:03.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And it has to be
organic because you don't want

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:04.709 align:middle line:90%
to get all the chemicals.

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.211 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: You know, it
should ideally be organic,

00:39:06.211 --> 00:39:08.447 align:middle line:84%
but here's another wonderful
thing about the bacteria.

00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:09.948 align:middle line:90%
They're master cleansers.

00:39:09.948 --> 00:39:12.417 align:middle line:84%
Like if you eat a piece of
salmon and you're worried

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:14.219 align:middle line:84%
because it has a lot
of mercury in it and -

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:17.823 align:middle line:84%
salmon isn't a high source
of mercury, but heavy metals

00:39:17.823 --> 00:39:19.658 align:middle line:84%
in our foods or chemicals
in our foods

00:39:19.658 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:90%
because they've been sprayed,

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:23.328 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the main
jobs of the bacteria.

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:90%
They'll eat it up.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.331 align:middle line:90%
They'll get rid of it for you.

00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:29.601 align:middle line:84%
So if you can only afford a head
of cabbage - now, I have to say

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:32.304 align:middle line:84%
that I went to the farmer's
market and I made nine jars

00:39:32.304 --> 00:39:38.376 align:middle line:84%
for - I made six - yeah, nine
jars for $9.00, $9.00 or $10.00.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:39.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh,
you're kidding.

00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: I bought
them at the farmer's market.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.881 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot more expensive
at whole foods,

00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
but still it's extraordinary.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.052 align:middle line:84%
I always wish I could
go into neighborhoods

00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:49.888 align:middle line:84%
where people are not eating
well and they're always worried

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.423 align:middle line:90%
that healthy is expensive.

00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:52.924 align:middle line:90%
This is not expensive.

00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing for the money.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Now, I asked
you once about red peppers

00:39:57.028 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and green peppers and
so forth and those -

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.499 align:middle line:84%
I tend to be allergic
to some nightshades.

00:40:00.499 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:90%
But you said -

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: It's

00:40:03.502 --> 00:40:05.003 align:middle line:84%
like fermenting changes
everything, you know.

00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:06.505 align:middle line:90%
It just improves everything.

00:40:06.505 --> 00:40:08.707 align:middle line:84%
Green peppers are left
- are picked immature

00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:10.208 align:middle line:90%
and red are left on the vine.

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to pick a pepper,

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.945 align:middle line:90%
pick a red or yellow pepper.

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:15.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: A pickled pepper.

00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:16.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: That's
exactly what I -

00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's a
pickled pepper, isn't it?

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.951 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: It
was a picked pepper.

00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:21.453 align:middle line:90%
Picked red.

00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:23.121 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is - I
wanted just to say,

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:25.757 align:middle line:84%
because we got off the
subject, as we often do,

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:27.325 align:middle line:90%
okay, three simple steps.

00:40:27.325 --> 00:40:29.895 align:middle line:90%
First, shred your cabbage.

00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, you want
to make a brine.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.767 align:middle line:84%
So you take your blender and
you put in some water and then,

00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:38.403 align:middle line:84%
what I've learned to do now -
this is the best, simplest way -

00:40:38.403 --> 00:40:39.905 align:middle line:90%
is I put in a couple apples

00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:43.675 align:middle line:84%
because they're sweet
and they love sugar.

00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:46.278 align:middle line:84%
So I put a couple of sweet
apples in there and blend those

00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:49.581 align:middle line:84%
up and then I'll put in our
starter, our plantarum starter,

00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:53.285 align:middle line:84%
because I want this to be
a super, super rich batch

00:40:53.285 --> 00:40:55.787 align:middle line:84%
with all these great - you know,
you don't have to do it, but -

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You've done the
work for us with the starter.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: [Multiple
speakers] It really makes it

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.292 align:middle line:84%
great if you would
put the starter in.

00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:02.027 align:middle line:84%
Okay, then I put in some - I
open up some of our minerals

00:41:02.027 --> 00:41:04.362 align:middle line:84%
because they love
minerals and, you know,

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:06.765 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time our food
grew in mineral-rich soil

00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:08.266 align:middle line:90%
so I dump in some minerals.

00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:11.736 align:middle line:84%
And I put a small amount of
salt, like two teaspoons maybe,

00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:14.639 align:middle line:84%
and then I put in - we have
something called Eco Bloom

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.141 align:middle line:84%
and I'll put a scoop
of that in there

00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:17.842 align:middle line:90%
because that feeds them also.

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:22.047 align:middle line:84%
So you can tell it, but
our jars are very hearty,

00:41:22.047 --> 00:41:23.548 align:middle line:90%
super ready-to-go when they're -

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:25.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: [Multiple
speakers] Wow, a complete meal.

00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well,
they do have all kinds -

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.721 align:middle line:84%
if you have a piece of
protein, like a piece of fish

00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:32.224 align:middle line:84%
or scrambled eggs or something,
and a scoop or two of these,

00:41:32.224 --> 00:41:33.992 align:middle line:90%
you've got a complete meal.

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:36.328 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just explaining that
the way we make them is hearty

00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:38.029 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to
make them that way.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:41.233 align:middle line:84%
But, okay, so Step Two is
you blend up this brine,

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:43.668 align:middle line:84%
pour it into your
veggies that you shredded,

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:45.303 align:middle line:84%
and Step Three is you
pack them in a jar.

00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:48.273 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get to the
top of the jar - you see,

00:41:48.273 --> 00:41:52.544 align:middle line:84%
you want them to be juicy,
so you put the brine in there

00:41:52.544 --> 00:41:54.813 align:middle line:84%
and you make enough brine so
that they're nice and juicy

00:41:54.813 --> 00:41:56.514 align:middle line:84%
because the juice
is great for you.

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
pack them down, right?

00:41:58.016 --> 00:41:59.517 align:middle line:90%
You push them down?

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Pack
them real tight

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:90%
because you don't want any air.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.022 align:middle line:84%
And then at the very top,
we take a leaf of cabbage

00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:05.824 align:middle line:84%
or collared greens or something
and put that at the top.

00:42:05.824 --> 00:42:10.562 align:middle line:84%
We put on the lid, no air can
get in, and you're good to go.

00:42:10.562 --> 00:42:12.364 align:middle line:84%
Nature does the rest
of the work for you.

00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:13.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: And it just -

00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:15.367 align:middle line:84%
and it goes through
the fermenting process.

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:16.868 align:middle line:90%
Now what if it starts to bubble?

00:42:16.868 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Or is there anything
to look out for?

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Sometimes
it might

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.373 align:middle line:84%
because you might overfill
them and so, like on Day Two

00:42:21.373 --> 00:42:23.675 align:middle line:84%
or something, they're beginning
to bubble a little bit.

00:42:23.675 --> 00:42:25.176 align:middle line:90%
So just loosen the lid.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.345 align:middle line:84%
If you want to pour out
some of the juice, you can.

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:28.847 align:middle line:90%
Tighten it back up again.

00:42:28.847 --> 00:42:31.716 align:middle line:84%
The juice, though - oh, my gosh,
the juice is very important.

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.519 align:middle line:84%
We encourage our mothers to
eat this when they're pregnant

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:37.422 align:middle line:84%
to get that good bacteria in
their gut, in the birth canal,

00:42:37.422 --> 00:42:40.592 align:middle line:84%
so the baby picks it up and
has a healthy inner ecosystem.

00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:44.462 align:middle line:84%
That's important for
when they're born.

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:45.964 align:middle line:90%
But we give it to our babies.

00:42:45.964 --> 00:42:48.900 align:middle line:84%
We actually give the juice in
little dropper fulls to babies

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.602 align:middle line:90%
when they're born to make sure

00:42:50.602 --> 00:42:53.071 align:middle line:84%
that they are digesting
their mother's milk

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and they get this
healthy inner ecosystem

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.841 align:middle line:84%
which will be their
immune system.

00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:58.343 align:middle line:90%
I keep -

00:42:58.343 --> 00:42:59.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I would think
[inaudible] for good, huh?

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:01.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Oh, it's the
beginning of your immune system.

00:43:01.346 --> 00:43:04.449 align:middle line:84%
Seventy-five percent of
your immune system is there

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:07.085 align:middle line:84%
or not based on whether you
have these bacteria living,

00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:10.355 align:middle line:84%
all this community of
bacteria, living in your gut.

00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:11.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
then the small amount

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:13.358 align:middle line:84%
of the apple doesn't
ferment in -

00:43:13.358 --> 00:43:14.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: No, no.

00:43:14.859 --> 00:43:16.594 align:middle line:84%
For them, it's just now a
little bit of apple juice water

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.464 align:middle line:84%
and they're eating that
sugar during the week

00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:20.965 align:middle line:90%
and growing more.

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:22.734 align:middle line:84%
If they have more food,
more of them won't grow.

00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:25.603 align:middle line:90%
It's all about food competition.

00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:27.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So, well,
speaking of foods.

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:28.606 align:middle line:84%
So you've given us a
chart here that we have

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:32.711 align:middle line:84%
that we can take a look at and
it is a combination of you say

00:43:32.711 --> 00:43:36.081 align:middle line:84%
about 80 percent
alkaline-forming foods,

00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:38.016 align:middle line:90%
which you said are green foods.

00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:39.517 align:middle line:90%
Are they cooked or raw?

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:41.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Well, both.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Cooked, raw, and fermented.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.022 align:middle line:90%
They can be from the ocean.

00:43:44.022 --> 00:43:45.523 align:middle line:90%
They can be from the land.

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:47.025 align:middle line:84%
I created this because
I got sick and tired

00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:48.626 align:middle line:84%
of having people say, "I
love the Body Ecology Diet.

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:50.729 align:middle line:84%
It makes so much sense,
but it's so hard to do."

00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:53.098 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
"No, it isn't."

00:43:53.098 --> 00:43:56.301 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed that the U.S.
Government had this thing called

00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:59.904 align:middle line:84%
MyPlate and I thought, "Well,
this is not a very good MyPlate,

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:04.209 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to create an
OurPlate for all of us."

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll notice that 80
percent of what's in green,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.784 align:middle line:84%
those are just alkaline-forming
foods and they're vegetables,

00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:16.821 align:middle line:84%
cooked, steamed, you
know, fermented, raw.

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.323 align:middle line:90%
You want everything.

00:44:18.323 --> 00:44:20.525 align:middle line:84%
They're all good and
it's about balance.

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:22.026 align:middle line:90%
And then ocean vegetables.

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:84%
Like these green
ones, the ones I made,

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:26.331 align:middle line:90%
they have wakame in them.

00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:27.832 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to mix.

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:29.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
mentioned that.

00:44:29.334 --> 00:44:30.835 align:middle line:90%
What is wakame?

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:32.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: This
is just one of five

00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:33.838 align:middle line:84%
or six great sea vegetables
that you can incorporate

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:90%
into salads and soups and all.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.509 align:middle line:84%
They give you a lot of
extra minerals in your diet.

00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:39.144 align:middle line:90%
Very alkalizing.

00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Green, leafy
- do you have kale in there?

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: I did put
kale in this one, I think.

00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:46.818 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I forget
how I make them.

00:44:46.818 --> 00:44:48.319 align:middle line:90%
But then the little orange part

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:51.956 align:middle line:84%
of the pie chart is your animal
proteins, like eggs and fish

00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:54.559 align:middle line:84%
and chicken and beef,
and I encourage people

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:59.097 align:middle line:84%
to find the foods that they tell
really work well in their body.

00:44:59.097 --> 00:45:01.966 align:middle line:84%
If fish is better for you,
don't eat beef, you know.

00:45:01.966 --> 00:45:04.169 align:middle line:84%
But if you have to have a
piece of beef every week

00:45:04.169 --> 00:45:06.638 align:middle line:84%
to feel strong and build
muscles, eat the beef,

00:45:06.638 --> 00:45:08.173 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
really different.

00:45:08.173 --> 00:45:09.774 align:middle line:84%
And then it's really
that simple.

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:11.843 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll notice
little circles on the outside

00:45:11.843 --> 00:45:14.679 align:middle line:84%
that say - the oils
are really important.

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:16.181 align:middle line:90%
Good, healthy oils.

00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:17.682 align:middle line:90%
And then dairy maybe.

00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:20.151 align:middle line:84%
Maybe. Some people thrive on
dairy and some people never do.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:21.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well,
you've talked a lot

00:45:21.653 --> 00:45:23.154 align:middle line:90%
about the coconut kefir.

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:24.856 align:middle line:90%
Now let's find out what it is.

00:45:24.856 --> 00:45:26.357 align:middle line:90%
What is coconut kefir?

00:45:26.357 --> 00:45:27.859 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite things

00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:90%
because this is really simple.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: It's
very magical.

00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:33.131 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so - and, also,
I have to tell you

00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that people think
I did this diet.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.502 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do this diet.

00:45:37.502 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Some power has been helping me
put it together, even telling me

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.443 align:middle line:84%
to put it together, forcing me
at times, sometimes even to go

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:48.012 align:middle line:84%
to other parts of the world to
find someone or meet someone

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:50.081 align:middle line:84%
or to get something
that's needed.

00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:52.617 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's amazing
really when I look back.

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:54.118 align:middle line:90%
It all came together.

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:57.822 align:middle line:84%
But this is another one of those
miracles that kind of got formed

00:45:57.822 --> 00:46:01.359 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to help kids
with autism and I kept saying,

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:03.127 align:middle line:84%
"I really want to help
kids with autism."

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:07.432 align:middle line:84%
And then a series of what I call
divine arrangements occurred

00:46:07.432 --> 00:46:12.503 align:middle line:84%
and I learned from a man about
coconuts and I noticed everybody

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:15.240 align:middle line:84%
out here in California was
drinking all this coconut water,

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.443 align:middle line:84%
but I knew it was loaded with
sugar and that if people ate it,

00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:20.144 align:middle line:84%
they'd age really fast
and they'd be really sick

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.646 align:middle line:90%
and they'd have candidiasis.

00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:23.514 align:middle line:84%
So one day I'm standing
in my kitchen

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:28.152 align:middle line:84%
and this little voice kind of
idea in my head says, "Ferment."

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.488 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that's too much
sugar in that coconut water.

00:46:30.488 --> 00:46:31.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not good for people.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.626 align:middle line:84%
And the voice says,
"Ferment the coconut water."

00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:38.696 align:middle line:84%
So I started fermenting it and
putting the good kefir starter,

00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:41.366 align:middle line:84%
which I was already teaching
people about milk kefir.

00:46:41.366 --> 00:46:43.968 align:middle line:84%
For people that can do milk,
they need to ferment it.

00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It's way better.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.971 align:middle line:84%
It's way better for
you than yogurt.

00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So the
bacteria eats the sugar?

00:46:48.473 --> 00:46:49.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: That's
their food source.

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
They break down the protein,
they digest the fats for you,

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.178 align:middle line:90%
and they eat up the sugar.

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So in milk there's
lactose, right?

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.584 align:middle line:84%
And I was encouraging people
to make milk kefir and give it

00:46:59.584 --> 00:47:01.619 align:middle line:84%
to their kids and all
instead of regular milk.

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:04.289 align:middle line:84%
Even babies at four months
can start having milk kefir.

00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:07.558 align:middle line:84%
But all the people in the world,
including autistic children

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:11.896 align:middle line:84%
that can't have dairy, you
know, again, it was amazing

00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:13.631 align:middle line:84%
because when the
first mom called

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:17.669 align:middle line:84%
with a little three-year-old, I
said - she lived in Charleston

00:47:17.669 --> 00:47:21.706 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, "She'll never
find coconuts in Charleston."

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:23.207 align:middle line:90%
But she did.

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:84%
She found them, she went home,
she started Thomas on these.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.279 align:middle line:84%
He's been well for
over 11 years now,

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:29.914 align:middle line:90%
completely well for a long time.

00:47:29.914 --> 00:47:31.416 align:middle line:84%
We've helped hundreds
of children recover.

00:47:31.416 --> 00:47:33.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So
how do you make it?

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:34.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: So
this is a magical food.

00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:38.389 align:middle line:84%
Because the autism community,
doctors and all and parents,

00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:41.392 align:middle line:84%
were finding out about this, it
spread all over very quickly.

00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:43.227 align:middle line:84%
In countries like
Australia, we've got lots

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:84%
of doctors recommending
it for autism.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so you take
the coconut water,

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.437 align:middle line:84%
which in this case is frozen
coconut water, and you want

00:47:52.437 --> 00:47:53.938 align:middle line:84%
to get coconut water
from Thailand

00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:56.107 align:middle line:84%
because it's the sweetest,
best for fermenting.

00:47:56.107 --> 00:47:58.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So you can get it
from a real Thai coconut or -

00:47:58.476 --> 00:47:59.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: In
the beginning,

00:47:59.978 --> 00:48:01.479 align:middle line:84%
that's all we had
was you had to break

00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:02.981 align:middle line:90%
up the coconut and pour it out.

00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:04.482 align:middle line:84%
Now the stores have the
coconuts open for you,

00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:07.986 align:middle line:84%
so you can buy three coconuts,
put it into a jar - well,

00:48:07.986 --> 00:48:11.556 align:middle line:84%
warm it first just to skin
temperature and then put it

00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:14.192 align:middle line:84%
in a jar and then
put your starter in.

00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:16.961 align:middle line:84%
Now, this - the only tricky
part of this is that you need

00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to keep it at a steady
temperature.

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.366 align:middle line:84%
It's more sensitive
than the vegetables.

00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:23.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: When you say
warm it, do you heat it or -

00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Yeah, I
put it in a little saucepan

00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:27.605 align:middle line:84%
and actually what I do is
I stick my finger in it.

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:30.341 align:middle line:84%
Wash my hands real well,
stick my finger in it,

00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:33.578 align:middle line:84%
and then when it's kind
of like skin temperature,

00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:35.079 align:middle line:90%
I know it's perfect.

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:38.483 align:middle line:84%
So I'll then pour it in the
glass jar, like one of these,

00:48:38.483 --> 00:48:42.153 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll put
in the starter.

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:44.288 align:middle line:84%
And then here's what I
do, I've learned to do,

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is I have this little
heating pad.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.259 align:middle line:84%
It's actually really
a table warmer.

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:53.097 align:middle line:84%
It's for the perfect
hostess that wants her dishes

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:55.666 align:middle line:90%
to be hot when her guests come.

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.168 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a plate warmer.

00:48:57.168 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So she sticks all
her plates in there,

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.671 align:middle line:84%
but it's like a really
long, skinny heating pad

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.173 align:middle line:90%
that I ordered off the Internet.

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.376 align:middle line:84%
So I just make this little
fence around my bottles

00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of coconut water and then it
can stay at a really steady -

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.650 align:middle line:84%
other people have different
techniques and they put them

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.919 align:middle line:84%
in their microwave
and underneath it.

00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:17.321 align:middle line:84%
They keep the light
on their microwave.

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: To
keep it warm, right.

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: They have
different techniques,

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.326 align:middle line:90%
but this is my latest technique.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.129 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens in
48 hours, it's fermented.

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:27.498 align:middle line:84%
And it tastes very
champagne-y like.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:30.968 align:middle line:84%
People are crazy about it, but
if you've got a real picky child

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.538 align:middle line:84%
with autism that are sensory -
you know, that have all kinds

00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:36.874 align:middle line:84%
of issues because their brain is
still not working right, they -

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:84%
their moms put a little juice,
like cranberry, pomegranate,

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:46.517 align:middle line:84%
acacia, a little bit of stevia,
and they just think it's juice.

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:48.853 align:middle line:90%
But it is really, truly magical.

00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:51.556 align:middle line:84%
It starts healing the gut
and, again - oh, I didn't get

00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:54.192 align:middle line:84%
to say this, but it's
important to say.

00:49:54.192 --> 00:49:58.796 align:middle line:84%
We have - this whole
region of our body,

00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:02.266 align:middle line:90%
this abdominal area, is a brain.

00:50:02.266 --> 00:50:03.768 align:middle line:90%
A major, major brain.

00:50:03.768 --> 00:50:06.637 align:middle line:84%
And it's connected through this
big nerve, the vagus nerve,

00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:08.139 align:middle line:90%
to the brain in our head.

00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:11.742 align:middle line:84%
So you can just imagine that
when you've got problems here,

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:13.244 align:middle line:90%
you've got problems here.

00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:16.614 align:middle line:84%
So now you have bacteria living
in there, good healthy bacteria.

00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:20.251 align:middle line:84%
They're talking to each other
and they really are amazing

00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:22.587 align:middle line:84%
at communicating and
helping each other grow.

00:50:22.587 --> 00:50:25.256 align:middle line:84%
One good bacteria
will secrete something

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:27.625 align:middle line:84%
to make another one grow beside
it, and they're just amazing.

00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:30.495 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll - some
will sacrifice themselves

00:50:30.495 --> 00:50:31.996 align:middle line:90%
for the good of the community

00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:35.199 align:middle line:84%
and it's really extraordinary
what they're doing inside of us.

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:37.735 align:middle line:84%
But they're communicating
to the gut wall

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:39.237 align:middle line:90%
and why are they doing that?

00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:42.573 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're telling the
brain important things.

00:50:42.573 --> 00:50:45.409 align:middle line:84%
And so you start healing the
gut with these fermented foods

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.478 align:middle line:84%
and changes start
happening all over your body.

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:50.148 align:middle line:90%
And it's a must for these kids.

00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:51.649 align:middle line:90%
It's a must for everybody.

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:54.185 align:middle line:84%
We all have a gut, we all have
a brain, and we all have a body.

00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:57.855 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
important missing link.

00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:00.658 align:middle line:84%
You know, if people would
get their yeast infections

00:51:00.658 --> 00:51:03.461 align:middle line:84%
under control, which they
will do with the diet -

00:51:03.461 --> 00:51:06.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You also talked
about the anti-aging aspects

00:51:06.364 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
of this and how correcting
the gut and the lining

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.869 align:middle line:84%
of the gut communicates
to the cells

00:51:11.869 --> 00:51:14.172 align:middle line:90%
to reverse the aging process.

00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:15.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well
this isn't new.

00:51:15.673 --> 00:51:17.175 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Elie Metchnikoff

00:51:17.175 --> 00:51:18.676 align:middle line:84%
over a hundred years ago
said, "You know what?

00:51:18.676 --> 00:51:21.846 align:middle line:84%
When people eat fermented foods,
they seem to live a long time

00:51:21.846 --> 00:51:23.848 align:middle line:90%
and they seem to live well."

00:51:23.848 --> 00:51:28.653 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't have any pain
in my body and, you know,

00:51:28.653 --> 00:51:30.988 align:middle line:84%
and I'm actually sort
of surprised, you know,

00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:90%
that I'm holding up so well

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.692 align:middle line:84%
because I do have a
busy, stressful life.

00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:38.963 align:middle line:84%
But Elie Metchnikoff,
he lived almost -

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:41.866 align:middle line:84%
he way outlived his
normal lifespan.

00:51:41.866 --> 00:51:44.669 align:middle line:84%
He lived into his 70s and
people died in those days

00:51:44.669 --> 00:51:46.504 align:middle line:90%
in their mid-40s or so.

00:51:46.504 --> 00:51:49.807 align:middle line:84%
So he ate fermented foods,
too, so it's not new.

00:51:49.807 --> 00:51:51.309 align:middle line:90%
It's just new to us.

00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Actually, all over the world

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.146 align:middle line:84%
where people eat fermented
foods, and they're everywhere.

00:51:55.146 --> 00:51:57.481 align:middle line:84%
People eat them and
their concept is,

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.983 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, they're healthy.

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:00.484 align:middle line:90%
They're good for you."

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.986 align:middle line:84%
They don't know why
they're good for you.

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:03.487 align:middle line:84%
And so I've tried
to bring the science

00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and now there's science
beyond my science.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words, now there's
this vast number of scientists

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.595 align:middle line:90%
out there, microbiologists,

00:52:10.595 --> 00:52:13.231 align:middle line:84%
studying the way these
microbes relate to each other.

00:52:13.231 --> 00:52:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I call them sociologists,
microbiologists,

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.103 align:middle line:84%
and explaining what they do and
what each individual one does,

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:21.706 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be -
it is literally bringing

00:52:21.706 --> 00:52:24.041 align:middle line:84%
about an entire revolution
in medicine.

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:25.543 align:middle line:90%
Very, very exciting.

00:52:25.543 --> 00:52:29.313 align:middle line:84%
For those of us alive today,
with the advances in medicine

00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:32.984 align:middle line:84%
like this and SimCells and
understanding our cells,

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:35.519 align:middle line:84%
which tell us specifically
you can't have saturated fats.

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.321 align:middle line:90%
You can eat certain fats.

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:40.291 align:middle line:84%
You know, the genes are going
to lead us to a lot of -

00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:41.792 align:middle line:90%
give us a lot of information

00:52:41.792 --> 00:52:43.561 align:middle line:84%
about what we can
and cannot eat.

00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:45.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You've
been a big passion -

00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:48.065 align:middle line:84%
you've had a huge passion for
anti aging and for the community

00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:51.402 align:middle line:84%
of people who don't need
to necessarily fall prey

00:52:51.402 --> 00:52:53.704 align:middle line:90%
to the normal ideas of aging.

00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:56.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: That's why I
wrote the Body Ecology Guide

00:52:56.574 --> 00:52:58.075 align:middle line:90%
to Growing Younger.

00:52:58.075 --> 00:53:00.945 align:middle line:84%
It's because we have,
just in the U.S. alone,

00:53:00.945 --> 00:53:06.517 align:middle line:84%
79 million Baby Boomers who,
in the next, most of them

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:09.387 align:middle line:84%
in the next 10 to 15 years, are
going to be leaving the planet.

00:53:09.387 --> 00:53:10.888 align:middle line:90%
Twenty for sure.

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:13.791 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have to
be that they suffer.

00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:17.528 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a matter of fact, the
real new age is at least 105.

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what our potential is.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:23.601 align:middle line:84%
But how are we going to
survive the next 15-20 years.

00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you die in 15 years.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.507 align:middle line:84%
With the Obamacare plan, you're
not going to get any help.

00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:31.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's got
to get back to basics.

00:53:31.008 --> 00:53:32.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: We have
to take care of ourselves.

00:53:32.743 --> 00:53:36.881 align:middle line:84%
So this is urgent that people
that are aging, which happens

00:53:36.881 --> 00:53:40.651 align:middle line:84%
to be everybody, by the way,
understands how to reverse

00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:43.821 align:middle line:84%
and prevent aging and we have
the answers for that, too.

00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:45.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So we have a slide

00:53:45.323 --> 00:53:50.194 align:middle line:84%
that shows the seven universal
laws of what Body Ecology is

00:53:50.194 --> 00:53:53.064 align:middle line:84%
and that is a very
important point of what -

00:53:53.064 --> 00:53:56.600 align:middle line:84%
how to teach the
system of Body Ecology -

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.636 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is the
principle of uniqueness

00:53:58.636 --> 00:54:01.505 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
principle of balance.

00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:06.477 align:middle line:84%
There's the principle of acid
alkaline - I'm getting there.

00:54:06.477 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And food combining,
which we talked about.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.248 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't actually
talk about that.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: And
the principle

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.819 align:middle line:84%
of cleansing is really,
really important.

00:54:14.819 --> 00:54:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And combining, yeah.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.822 align:middle line:84%
Food combining, do you
want to talk about that?

00:54:17.822 --> 00:54:19.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Just real quickly.

00:54:19.323 --> 00:54:20.825 align:middle line:84%
We just have about
a minute left.

00:54:20.825 --> 00:54:22.326 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Oh, dear.

00:54:22.326 --> 00:54:23.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I know,
it's a huge topic.

00:54:23.828 --> 00:54:25.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Actually,
if we only have a minute,

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:26.831 align:middle line:84%
all this is in the
book, you know,

00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:28.332 align:middle line:90%
and I've got so many websites.

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.834 align:middle line:84%
Please go to the website
and join Facebook,

00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:31.435 align:middle line:84%
where we have a community, but
I would just like to tell people

00:54:31.435 --> 00:54:33.971 align:middle line:84%
that if you do three things
to add fermented foods

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.541 align:middle line:84%
to your diet, only eat good
oils and get off the sugar

00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:41.212 align:middle line:84%
and use stevia instead,
you've made a huge step

00:54:41.212 --> 00:54:43.414 align:middle line:84%
on the right direction and
you will start getting well.

00:54:43.414 --> 00:54:44.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
to also get all

00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:46.417 align:middle line:90%
of the gluten out of your diet.

00:54:46.417 --> 00:54:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Gluten,
sugar, but also stress.

00:54:48.753 --> 00:54:50.254 align:middle line:90%
Sleep well.

00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:52.523 align:middle line:84%
Get your vitamin D levels
up and get the stress down

00:54:52.523 --> 00:54:54.725 align:middle line:90%
and you're good to go.

00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:56.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So
your basic message is

00:54:56.227 --> 00:54:57.862 align:middle line:84%
that all health begins
in the gut.

00:54:57.862 --> 00:54:59.597 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the immune system,

00:54:59.597 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:84%
with the inner ecosystem, and,
of course, with the brain.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.337 align:middle line:84%
And it really helps
with all illness.

00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:08.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: If you have a
healthy gut, you're on your way

00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to an extremely healthy body.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.942 align:middle line:84%
It's not the only
thing you have to do.

00:55:11.942 --> 00:55:14.345 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, people will
fix the gut and then go

00:55:14.345 --> 00:55:17.748 align:middle line:84%
on to the next step, but
if you have a bad gut,

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:20.384 align:middle line:84%
then you really - you
have to fix that first.

00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:22.953 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
have to fix the gut.

00:55:22.953 --> 00:55:25.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: On your website,
you have a huge community

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:27.725 align:middle line:84%
of people and all over
the Internet really now

00:55:27.725 --> 00:55:29.226 align:middle line:90%
since this has been a movement.

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:30.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Donna Gates: Oh, yeah.

00:55:30.728 --> 00:55:32.229 align:middle line:84%
There's YouTube videos
and everything.

00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:33.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: On how
to make the foods.

00:55:33.731 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:84%
There's people to connect with
that have made different types

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:38.302 align:middle line:84%
of recipes and experienced
them in different ways.

00:55:38.302 --> 00:55:41.238 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge community of
people that are practicing.

00:55:41.238 --> 00:55:43.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: Well, we know
at least tens of thousands.

00:55:43.374 --> 00:55:45.209 align:middle line:84%
We believe at least a
hundred thousand people

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:51.248 align:middle line:84%
We're not counting, but we've
sold over 350,000 copies

00:55:51.248 --> 00:55:54.418 align:middle line:84%
of the books and people
are learning this.

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the future, really.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The more educated people
become, the more they're going

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.726 align:middle line:84%
to realize this is all in a
tight package for them and,

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:04.995 align:middle line:84%
if they don't feel overwhelmed
and just start doing it,

00:56:04.995 --> 00:56:08.532 align:middle line:84%
then go back and start learning
why does it work so well.

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:10.034 align:middle line:90%
They'll be really excited.

00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:14.605 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think keeps
you committed to a program is

00:56:14.605 --> 00:56:16.140 align:middle line:84%
that you begin to
understand, "Oh,

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.875 align:middle line:90%
this is why this works so well."

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So you
start by feeling good

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:21.278 align:middle line:84%
and then you go back
to figure out why.

00:56:21.278 --> 00:56:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: You
got to fix the brain.

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.281 align:middle line:90%
The gut, the brain.

00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:26.383 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people aren't thinking
too well anymore and, oh,

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:29.086 align:middle line:84%
my gosh, one in five children
has mental illness today

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:32.923 align:middle line:84%
and we're - you know, they're
shooting people and everything.

00:56:32.923 --> 00:56:35.059 align:middle line:84%
It's not a gun problem; it's
a mental illness problem.

00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:37.728 align:middle line:84%
And, believe it or not,
gut and brain starts here.

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:40.698 align:middle line:84%
Give me any one of those kids
- they usually end up dead

00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:44.101 align:middle line:84%
or something, sadly enough -
but I wish I could go back,

00:56:44.101 --> 00:56:46.804 align:middle line:84%
give them the right diet, and
we might not have the tragedy.

00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:49.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, you've got
a wonderful mission here that's

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.875 align:middle line:84%
created an incredible
movement and I'm really glad

00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:52.376 align:middle line:90%
that you were on today.

00:56:52.376 --> 00:56:53.878 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being here.

00:56:53.878 --> 00:56:55.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Donna Gates: I'm
so grateful to be on.

00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:58.048 align:middle line:84%
I love it that you get
what I do and you can see

00:56:58.048 --> 00:57:00.484 align:middle line:84%
that we're both very
passionate about this.

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:02.119 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for what you do, too.

00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:05.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: A lot of info in
one hour, so thank you so much.

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:06.957 align:middle line:84%
