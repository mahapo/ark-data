00:00:14.074 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And today we're talking
about our health.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about it by covering

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of
topics-- everything

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:84%
from our greatest health
challenges to ways

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to achieve peak performance
and optimal health.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about some
of the latest cutting edge

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:90%
research around that.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:84%
All the while, reversing
the aging process.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Does that sound
interesting to you?

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is David Wolfe.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the world's top
authorities on natural healing,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.039 align:middle line:84%
on organic nutrition,
and superfoods

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be talking
about a little later on.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WOLFE: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.273 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:84%
David is a true icon
in the health industry,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and I really appreciate
your knowledge,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:84%
your immense
participation in helping

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.539 align:middle line:84%
people learn a lot
about their bodies.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Thank you.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So talk to me about what
you experience when you travel.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you hear as
people's biggest health

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
challenge right now?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Definitely the biggest
complaint is low energy.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Energy.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.388 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's affecting
just about everybody.

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And especially women
are multi-tasking.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So many single moms out there.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
There are so many stresses,
pulls from here and there.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
depleted adrenally.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.245 align:middle line:84%
We're getting wiped
out on stimulants.

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we've still
got to get the job done.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.585 align:middle line:90%
So low energy is a big issue.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Low energy,
though, is a result

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of other things.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.255 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:30.755 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a result of-- there's
immunological problems

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.144 align:middle line:84%
where we don't really have the
immunity that we used to have.

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And that actually has a
lot to do with energy.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
50% of our immune system is
actually detoxifying our body.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So if our immune
system isn't happening,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
then we're getting clogged up.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
We're getting backed up, and the
biological machine that we are

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't function as efficiently.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the energy that
our immune system all day

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.085 align:middle line:84%
long, it's putting out 50% of
its energy to detoxification.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Clean up the cells.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of waste products.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Make the cellular
environment happy and healthy

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:90%
for all the cells to grow in.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why are diseases
like heart disease and diabetes

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and so forth on
the rise so much?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And obesity in children?

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Why are those diseases
of epidemic proportions?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, they've
been there all along.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
These diseases have just been
accelerated by our lifestyle.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
They've accelerated
by the pollution

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%
that we all are bathed in.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
They've been accelerated by the
stress that we're all feeling.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They've been accelerated by the
problems with our food supply

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:90%
and challenges with clean food.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And also challenges with food
that's actually nutritious.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
nutrition problems today.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Salads and so forth?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.813 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.715 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough minerals
in our salads even.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I had to find this
all out the hard way

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
by being a real
gastronaut and being

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:90%
out there really finding out.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Let me just live on salad for a
few years and see what happens.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And finding out that
even those salads

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
with all those great
vegetables, still

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:90%
not enough minerals for us.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what led
me to the development of all

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
the ideas about superfoods,
herbalism-- bringing things

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
together so that we could
create a more holistic dietary

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
pattern that we could follow.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
not just eat healthy

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and live a great lifestyle.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.035 align:middle line:90%
This goes way beyond that.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:90%
We're eating healthy.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to do a
good diet and exercise.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.569 align:middle line:90%
This goes way way beyond that.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: This goes beyond that.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.151 align:middle line:90%
But it's very simple, actually.

00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just that now we're
on to the best stuff.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, it
was like-- in the '50s,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
we were eating burgers
and fries and milkshakes

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:90%
because that's all there was.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
also to point out

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
to the people who are
eating burgers and fries

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and milkshakes, it's OK because
you can still get to this level

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not something where
you have to graduate to.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
You can start applying or
incorporating superfoods

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.329 align:middle line:90%
into your diet right away.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, it's
all about flavor.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.969 align:middle line:90%
We cracked the flavor code.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Why does someone want to have
burgers, fries, and milkshakes?

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:90%
'Cause it tastes good.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So how do we make
things taste better?

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%
We've been on that for years.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
with the top raw food

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
chefs, superfood chefs,
and herbalists in the world

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:90%
to crack the flavor code.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:90%
We cracked that.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's why.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It tastes better.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so good.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.672 align:middle line:90%
So does taste good.

00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:15.171 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
energy production.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
How exactly does that
work in the body?

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
I know that you have a few--

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.982 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at a slide here.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this slide up
here on the Krebs cycle.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's our citric acid
cycle or the cycle in our body

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that takes the nutrients,
the raw nutrients--

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
macronutrients like protein,
carbohydrates, fats, and oils--

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and converts it into energy
packets that our body uses.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So for example, our body doesn't
speak in the energy currency

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.577 align:middle line:84%
of protein, fat,
and carbohydrate.

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's using a different currency.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.716 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're coming over
to America with British pounds.

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trying to use them.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: And trying to use them.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wait a second.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
We don't use those here.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So it has to convert it, and
that's called the Krebs cycle.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And the ratio of protein to fat
to carbohydrates-- that ratio

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
right there is going
to determine the energy

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:90%
that we produce.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.224 align:middle line:84%
And that ratio is
unique to the person.

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every
person is different?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.556 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Every person.

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have talked about
before that you actually

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.922 align:middle line:84%
need moderate carbohydrate,
high protein, low fat diet.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's me personally.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You personally,
that's probably best for you.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, Dave and I
discussed that a little bit.

00:05:26.308 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Now for most people,
they say a high protein

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:90%
diet's good for everyone.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Or a vegetarian diet
is good for everyone.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that necessarily
the case or not?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: No, it's
obviously not the case.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We're finding out
more as we go further.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
We've never had
the sophistication

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of cross-referencing all this
information like we have today.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the
past is like old news.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because now in the computer age,
we can cross-reference data.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we can go,
oh, wait a second.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we understand why some
people can be vegetarians,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.282 align:middle line:90%
why some people can't.

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Why some people
can be a vegetarian

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.405 align:middle line:90%
if they do certain things.

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Where they couldn't
before, 'cause they

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:90%
didn't have those choices.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:90%
All of that's on the table now.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Why does somebody
run into a problem

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
if they're a blood type A
and they're a meat eater?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the other side
of it is that there's

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.626 align:middle line:84%
some people actually
should not be carnivores.

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Should
not be eating meat

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:90%
if they are certain blood types.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a lot
theory about that.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.395 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So we're
cross-referencing that data

00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:21.246 align:middle line:84%
now, and we're coming to
some startling conclusions.

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're gonna
get into all through our time

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:90%
together today.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.944 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about the fact that we

00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
have these rampant diseases
and a lot of people

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
at the same time are
looking for energy.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning how--
so how does energy actually

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:90%
start to occur in the body?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.828 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's look at ATP here.

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
This is adenosine triphosphate,
probably the best known

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.577 align:middle line:90%
nucleotide of all.

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Does a nucleotide have
anything to do with a tide?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
A nucleotide is an
energy currency.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.717 align:middle line:90%
It's like using the dollar bill.

00:06:50.717 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the body.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: In the body, yeah.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
produce energy.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what's
interesting-- this

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is a big discovery-- is
that all the foods have

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to be converted into
ATP to make energy.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Except for some, and those
are marine phytoplanktons.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.089 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
organisms, like algaes--

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:90%
you've heard of like Spirulina.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.665 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's organisms like
that in the ocean that

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
can be eaten by a human being
that bypass the Krebs cycle

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.785 align:middle line:84%
and are immediately
available as energy.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
called superfoods.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.586 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why marine
phytoplankton is a superfood.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Cousteau said the future
of nutrition is in the ocean.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're
figuring out tricks.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But the key idea, though,
for most of us at home

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
is-- You know, marine
phytoplankton's exotic.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.525 align:middle line:84%
But what's for most
of us is that we've

00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out what the
ratio of fat to carbohydrate

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to protein is for us that
really works to produce energy.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
ratio is correct,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:90%
we produce lots of energy.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.364 align:middle line:84%
If the ratio is incorrect, we
produce low amounts of energy

00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:84%
'cause the Krebs
cycle doesn't get

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
what it needs to produce
the packets of ATP.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So now what if
somebody, for example,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
has blood sugar issues or
diabetes or something like that

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
where they're constantly
struggling with fluctuations up

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and down.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
How do they get
that energy cycle

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to work if they have blood
pressure fluctuations?

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, we just look at a person.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a person
needs a moderate amount

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of carbohydrates, but they
can't eat carbohydrates

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
because they have such
blood-sugar roller-coastering

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.576 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Then in that case,
we'd recommend

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
for that person have
polysaccharides.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Seaweed.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Medicinal mushrooms.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Things that contain
long chain sugars

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.225 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't get
a blood sugar spike.

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
You still get the
carbohydrate, but you

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
don't get the blood sugar spike.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Even potato can give
you a blood sugar

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
spike-- baked potato,
blood sugar spike.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Also I'd recommend for
someone in that situation

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to go to something like a sweet
potato instead of a potato,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
because you get
longer chain sugars

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and you have three
times as many minerals.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've mentioned that
word several times-- minerals.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
What is the
importance of minerals

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to energy?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Minerals are very correlated
with the length of life

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.241 align:middle line:90%
and a state of consciousness.

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the minerals in
our diet and in our food

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and in our environment have
a very strong effect on us.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.029 align:middle line:84%
And this has been shown in
animal studies, for example.

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
A wildebeest when
it becomes pregnant

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.055 align:middle line:84%
will migrate hundreds of
miles to a particular area

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
of volcanic soil
that has grass that

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
has a very high amount of
magnesium in it-- six times

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
as much as where
they normally are.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
If they are supplemented
with magnesium,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:90%
they don't migrate there.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So minerals affect our behavior.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
They affect what we eat.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And minerals also affect
our consciousness.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Now what's important
here is that people

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
who have diabetes or
hypoglycemia or blood sugar

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
problems are in a
demineralization syndrome.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
not widely known.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That is
not widely known.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It's very well known
in the nutrition world,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.208 align:middle line:84%
especially people have been
studying it really deeply

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:90%
for 50, 60, 70 years.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Back in the days when it was
Dr. Jensen and Dr. Walker.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They knew that there is
a very strong connection

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
between minerals and nutrition
and our state of health

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and that the state

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
in general as a
culture, is related

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:90%
to the state of our soils.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I step into their shoes, and
I make that connection for us.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.356 align:middle line:84%

And that's what the

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: And the herbs.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And organic food.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Organic food has vastly
more minerals in it

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:90%
than conventional food.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.881 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough, but
at least it's closer.

00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So what about someone who
has a thyroid dysfunction.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's look
at thyroid here.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.324 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at some
slides about protein diets

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you
need that if you

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
need to balance out
being too demineralized.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
But now let's jump into thyroid.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:90%
The thyroid is our shield.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Actually "thyros" is the
meaning of "thyroid."

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a Greek word
meaning "shield,"

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and it shields us
from oxidation.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we got hit
by a very strong oxidant

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
like radioactive fallout.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.367 align:middle line:84%
Immediately our
thyroid reacts to that

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and pulls out all of its
negatively charged electricity.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid's like a
reservoir of electricity.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And tries to neutralize
that oxidation, that burn.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you
have a thyroid disease,

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:90%
you have low energy production.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.039 align:middle line:90%
And low electricity.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And so then that will cause
the thyroid to malfunction.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Also the thyroid is
heavily vascularized.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's lot of blood
flow through the thyroid.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that it will pick up

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
things from your
blood than it needs.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
However, it can be tricked.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So if it needs--
for example-- iodine

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.739 align:middle line:84%
and there's radioactive
iodine in the environment,

00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
it'll pull that in.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
If It needs iodine and there's
chloride in the environment--

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.025 align:middle line:90%
let's say chlorine water.

00:11:40.025 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
That you're drinking
chlorinated water.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:90%
It will pull that in.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
If there's fluoride in your
body from fluoridated water

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's passing
by your thyroid,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid will think,
oh, that's iodine.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.348 align:middle line:90%
It's actually fluoride.

00:11:51.348 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:90%
It will pull that in.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So the thyroid has become
totally toxic in our bodies.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge issue of
what's going on today.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And then it can't do its job.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It can't produce the T3.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It can't regulate
body temperature.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.545 align:middle line:90%
We start having chronic fatigue.

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We go into, basically,
mood disorders.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole bunch of
stuff that's related here.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's also the dry
skin and the hair falling out.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.117 align:middle line:90%
And all that.

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Hair falling out
is a very strong symptom

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:90%
of thyroid problems.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And eyebrows
thinning and so forth.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Why is that correlated?

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, your thyroid is
your master metabolism gland.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
metabolic functions going on

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day with
like, for example,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.193 align:middle line:90%
you're growing your nails.

00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:90%
You're shedding your skin.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:90%
You're growing hair.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.034 align:middle line:84%
If your thyroid's
completely out of whack,

00:12:36.034 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
then you can't do
those things properly.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Your body doesn't get the
biofeedback loop or something

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:90%
goes awry.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.074 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:42.573 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:42.573 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So now all of this-- basically
the overarching conversation

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
here has to do with the
aging process and how we age.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And what types of
disease start to happen

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
as we go through years and
years and years of abuse

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.205 align:middle line:90%
on our bodies.

00:12:56.205 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.788 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And abuse could
be even eating healthy,

00:12:58.788 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
as you said earlier.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Which blows my mind.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So let's get to some solutions.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me a little bit
about the aging process

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.132 align:middle line:84%
and what that means
when we start to age.

00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: There's a number of
meanings to the aging process.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%
One is oxidation.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Free-radical theory of aging.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:90%
What the heck does that mean?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
When we're born out of
our mother's waters,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.027 align:middle line:90%
we've never seen the atmosphere.

00:13:21.027 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we're
in the atmosphere.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now this atmosphere, this earth,
actually is needed to survive.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:90%
We breathe it.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:90%
But it also kills us.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It burns us up,
subtly and slowly.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen we breathe
actually hurts us.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the free
radical theory of aging

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that was put forth about--
jeez, it's been 30 years.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
the aging process.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So we want to take in as
many antioxidants as possible

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.754 align:middle line:84%
to protect ourself from
breathing our atmosphere.

00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't think of it
that way, you know.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we were like
an alien space race,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and we crash landed
on the planet.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And we could survive
in this atmosphere,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
but it may not be the best
type of atmosphere for us.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of what we're doing.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's kind
of what's happening.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's kind
of what's happening.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.482 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:03.482 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Same with our food
supply and everything.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It's good for you, but it's not.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We can survive
on it, but it's not really

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:90%
the best thing.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we're finding out,
well actually, if we really

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
want to ask that question--
what's best-- what is it?

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Another theory of aging
has to do with methylation.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- basically,
that's why we need raw foods,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:90%
so we have enough methyl groups.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, beet
juice-- like beet root--

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.524 align:middle line:90%
is very high in methyl groups.

00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Goji berry's very
high in methyl groups.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
All fresh foods are
high in methyl groups.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And that helps
our liver detoxify

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the 77,000 chemicals
that have been

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
dumped in the
environment since 1940.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's a
lot of chemicals.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.338 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's seven different
detoxification pathways

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in the body that
constantly are working

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:90%
to detoxify all day long.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what you were
talking about earlier.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I remember one of
them is like KILLS-- kidney,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:90%
intestines, lung, liver, skin.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Good way of--
Good way of remembering--

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Anyway another
one is telomeres.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%
So like a shoelace.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There's that little thing,
that little plastic thing

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the shoelace.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.331 align:middle line:84%
When we're born, we
have that little thing;

00:15:03.331 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
it protects the ends
of our chromosomes.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
With every cell replication, a
little bit of that chromosome

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:90%
is lost.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:90%
In every cell.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Little tiny
hairs on a cell.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.643 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:15:13.643 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Just the little end of
the filament is lost.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.198 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit
of damage at the end

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:90%
of the DNA with every cell.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's a
white blood cell.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's a muscle
cell or a heart cell,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.911 align:middle line:90%
we lose a little bit.

00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make much of a
difference in a year or 10

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:90%
years or 15 years or 30 years.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But in 100 years, it
makes a huge difference.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's those
little tiny hairs are

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
what enable the
cells to replicate?

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: No, they're just
part of the DNA material.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is is
we're experiencing DNA damage

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.217 align:middle line:84%
every time the cell
has to replicate.

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:46.841 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:47.341 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And that
little bit of damage

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:90%
is no big deal in the beginning.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:90%
But later it becomes a big deal.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And those endcaps of the
DNA are called telomeres.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So the idea in science-- it's
been around for a long time,

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
ever since I can
remember actually--

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
has been to figure out if
there's a way to actually heal

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
the end of the DNA instead
of losing something or just

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.686 align:middle line:90%
stopping the damage.

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:10.685 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to actually
restore it and get it

00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
back to the original
shoelace end

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.325 align:middle line:84%
that we got when we bought
our shoes brand new.

00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
To heal the telomere.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: To heal the telomere.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And then that research
led to the discovery

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that when you do that, that
you actually become younger--

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that the length of that telomere
is correlated to your age.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And the shorter that it
is, the older you are.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the symptoms
associated with aging

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
are related to the
length of that telomere.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there like a
scientist that discovered this?

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Someone who had--?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.121 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: There was.

00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:40.622 align:middle line:84%
Let's go jump into it and look
at some of these things here.

00:16:40.622 --> 00:16:41.121 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:90%
So there's the telomere.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the biological
time clock or the fuse

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that represents how much
life you've burned off

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and how much life you have left.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
That's at the end
of your chromosones.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so then here's the
Nobel Prize Laureates

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
who really discovered that
the chromosomes are protected

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
by telomeres and then
it's possible even

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.255 align:middle line:84%
to molecularly correct
telomere damage.

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:04.829 align:middle line:84%
We are at a precipice, by the
way, in health and nutrition

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and in medicine that
is science fiction.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:90%
We're coming there.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is is we're
realizing, wait a second.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
actually get in there

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and correct cellular
damage and genetic damage

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and de-age ourself and create
the potential of living

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.926 align:middle line:84%
not only to be 100, but 200
or 300 or 500 or even more.

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The scientific
breakthroughs right now with

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.709 align:middle line:84%
this and the stem
cell research are--

00:17:30.709 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's incredible.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely
amazing what's being done.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And the studies that
are being funded

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to replicate the processes.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
there are awards

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:90%
also being gained recently.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.575 align:middle line:90%
I mean this was 2009.

00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.343 align:middle line:84%
So what they discovered
is that if you

00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
can regrow the length
of the telomere,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
reverse the aging process

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.606 align:middle line:84%
and stop the damage of what the
free radicals do to the cells.

00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of it.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
meshed together.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Like there's free
radical damage that we're

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
experiencing from
breathing the atmosphere.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
There is methylation
damage we've

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.354 align:middle line:84%
gotten because of our food
wasn't really that great.

00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Plus we have all these
chemicals we're dealing with.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.436 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing it in.

00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:90%
We're eating it all the time.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
methylation problem,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
but we also a telomere problem.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But the telomere problem
is very fundamental.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
If we can correct that--
just like when you're 16,

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:90%
you are stronger.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.782 align:middle line:90%
You have more resistance.

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You're in the
prime of your life.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So those are growing.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle line:84%
Those are the telomere
in full swing.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
That's like when our
telomeres are healthy.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
We haven't lost very much.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
get back to that,

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
we're resistant to
everything else.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea there.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's possible?

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.893 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That is possible.

00:18:38.893 --> 00:18:40.284 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is what
has been discovered now.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.487 align:middle line:90%
This is what we heard about.

00:18:43.487 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't necessarily believe
that what we heard about

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.622 align:middle line:90%
is actually where we really are.

00:18:47.622 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But what we've heard about
and what's been discovered

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is that astragalus, which
is the great Chinese herb--

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:90%
one of the top three, for sure.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a root-- contains a
compound which can actually

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
increase or create in your
genetic code telomerase, which

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is a substance that actually
repairs your telomere.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that a mineral?

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Telomerase?

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Telomerase
is an enzyme.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: An enzyme.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.673 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:19:14.673 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything that ends with
an ASE is an enzyme.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So telomerase is an enzyme
that can correct any damage

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to the chromosome end,
which is the telomere.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's proven that
if you actually can increase

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres that you can
actually reverse this aging

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:90%
process and you can do that--

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: With telomerase.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's one herb that's
been found that actually--

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
for sure, we know
actually it does the job.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's a concentrate of
a certain particular saponin

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:90%
fraction of astragalus.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.602 align:middle line:84%
So astragalus may have this
property or it may not,

00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
depending on where its
grown and how its grown.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you process it for that
one fraction of astragalus side

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
four, which is one of the
elements of astragalus.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
say a ton of material,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you can get enough of that
stuff that you can take it.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden your body
goes, oh, wait, and corrects

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
any telomere damage
because your body's

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.045 align:middle line:90%
able to produce telomerase.

00:20:08.045 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have any pictures
of the telomeres themselves?

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So the telomere is
something like-- let's

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
go into-- let's
see if we got here.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:90%
The telomere is like this.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It's at the end
of the DNA strand.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we want is we want that
telomerase to actually maintain

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and even add length
to the telomere.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the very end.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.844 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
end of a shoelace.

00:20:27.844 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind
of the idea there.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
The telomerase, you can see,
actually correcting and fixing

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:90%
the end of the DNA.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
is the way to-- I

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
mean, what could the
anti-aging benefits be?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Could it be a better memory?

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Could be-- I mean, how do
you propose living longer?

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
What quality of life is
really what I'm asking.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: When you're younger
and you have more vital life

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:84%
force and more energy,
your brain is more clear.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:90%
You have more endurance.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
You have more
ability to multitask

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.647 align:middle line:84%
without the stress
affecting you.

00:21:03.647 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You have a greater stress
defense shield basically

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm saying.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You also have more
reproductive power.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.651 align:middle line:84%
When you're younger, you
have more reproductive power.

00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:16.275 align:middle line:84%
It's like healthier for a woman
to have a baby at, say, 21 than

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.538 align:middle line:90%
at 51.

00:21:17.538 --> 00:21:18.996 align:middle line:84%
I did meet a woman
who actually had

00:21:18.996 --> 00:21:20.907 align:middle line:90%
a baby at 51-- healthy baby.

00:21:20.907 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:90%
She was 55, had a four-year-old.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really big deal in
terms of like what this means.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It means quality of life
increases, and you live longer.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Quantity and
quality of life increases.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You said the astragalus is one
of the key factors in growing

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:90%
the telomeres?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:90%
That particular fraction of it.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a specific
type of astragalus?

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you make this in
a tincture or a tea?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing some
amazing demonstrations later

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:51.957 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's great.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm so into astragalus,
I got into growing it.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just all about it.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I found out about
astragalus is is it's

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:90%
just like anything else.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We've never really
turned this on.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure this is where
the big breakthrough is

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:90%
going to come.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.669 align:middle line:90%
We take whatever herb it is.

00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And astragalus is now
leading the world right now

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
top herb on earth.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And we grow it in the
best way ever discovered--

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:84%
with the most minerals,
the most nutrients,

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:84%
real natural fertilizers
instead of this chemical stuff.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And really love
the plant the way

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:84%
it always had wanted to
be loved and supported.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
do in my garden.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, I suspect
that it's going

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.185 align:middle line:84%
to have more of those
chemicals that we want in it.

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you see where
we're going with that?

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've been, basically,
all over the world.

You have a farm that

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a good food.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I grow these foods.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I grow these herbs.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I grow these superfoods.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:84%
near my house in Ontario,
Canada of quartz crystals.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And the water there
is extraordinary.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:11.089 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it that

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
got all the minerals
from the crystals in it?

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And it glows
for some reason.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's sitting
in a crystal, so

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe has something
to do with it.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I drank that water actually.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I drank water out of a lake,
which I normally don't do.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I normally drink spring water.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.374 align:middle line:84%
But that water was so pure

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like very, very top

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.252 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so beautiful.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.931 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And then you can see
this place in the Grand Canyon.

00:23:41.931 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
This is Havasupai
in the Grand Canyon.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's on the southern
rim of the Grand Canyon.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the canyons that
leads into the greater Grand

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.204 align:middle line:84%
Canyon and eventually
into the Colorado River.

00:23:52.204 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here,
that vision of paradise.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
about this place

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is that atmospheric temperatures
may be 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
The temperature of that water
is 38 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:90%
It's freezing.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It's so freezing you
cannot even believe it.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So you're in 100
degrees, you're like,

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.493 align:middle line:90%
oh, I could jump in there.

00:24:10.493 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I could swim to that
waterfall easily.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no way.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.366 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: But there's no way.

00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:15.855 align:middle line:84%
You can, but it's
very difficult.

00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
in the Grand Canyon?

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.585 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's in
the Grand Canyon.

00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
absolutely beautiful.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: There's wild goji
berries growing there.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%
There's wild pomegranates.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Wild figs.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Wild mulberries.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these are
the areas that you've

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.001 align:middle line:84%
found the superfoods
actually growing.

00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:31.626 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:90%
They're actually growing there.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.353 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We should
mention a little bit

00:24:34.353 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
about what the superfoods
are and what is a superfood.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.976 align:middle line:90%
Let's just talk about foods.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There's food, which
is like caloric value.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.967 align:middle line:84%
Macronutrients like protein,
carbohydrate, fats, and oils.

00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
We need those.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But superfoods have medicinal
properties like herbs do,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:90%
but they also have calories.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Meaning they have carbohydrates.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:90%
They have fats and oils.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:56.527 align:middle line:90%
The have protein.

00:24:56.527 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're a complete food.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So they're
a complete food.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They're like herbs,
but they're food, too.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
So we call 'em superfoods.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Like aloe is like that.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Noni is like that.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Maca is like that.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Raw chocolate,
cacao, is like that.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Goji berry is like that.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.383 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These are all
mineral-based plant rich foods?

00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:17.466 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: These are like
super rich, amazing foods.

00:25:17.466 --> 00:25:18.049 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How many are there?

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I've detailed in
my book, "Superfoods," 20.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
But on earth?

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.245 align:middle line:90%
There's probably 50.

00:25:27.245 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:90%
This is important to know.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Out of all possibilities
on the earth--

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
let's say there's 250,000
food herbs on the earth

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
that we can eat-- about
50 of them are superfoods

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and about 50 of
them are superherbs.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's all the
foods that we should ever

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:90%
eat is the superfoods.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's all
you really need, yeah.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's all
you really need.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You don't
even need that much.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:90%
But if you had those, yeah.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:90%
That's enough.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.066 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the superfoods and
the superherbs would sustain

00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:90%
you completely--

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Completely.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and reverse
the aging process.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.095 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And reverse
the aging process.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:58.332 align:middle line:84%
Now that is the story that
the Taoist Immortals, who

00:25:58.332 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
developed the Shaolin
monasteries and developed

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine,
have been telling us

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And now I understand
it 'cause I've

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.610 align:middle line:84%
been a superfood hunter and
an herb hunter for years.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So now I get what
they were getting at.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I like lettuce.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I like apples.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.066 align:middle line:90%
But I don't need those things.

00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's sustainable
food that you would think

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:90%
would be great food for us.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's maybe how
those types of people

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
lived to be 120 years old.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Disease free.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Show us some of the other
places you've gone to.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.552 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So lets's look at this.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
This is in Iceland,
drinking green drinks.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's my friend Sola who's
an amazing chef over there.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.890 align:middle line:84%
She runs the hottest
restaurant in Reykjavik.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And we went all over
Iceland, tracking down

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.134 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of exotic things.

00:26:41.134 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:90%
This is in the Grand Canyon.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Those are all wild grapes.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And what a sight.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:90%
What a place to be.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Grape is, to me,
represents nobility.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
noble aspect of life.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And what grape really is
able to bring to us in terms

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of the chemistry is what
we call resveratrol.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Resveratrol is one of
the great breakthroughs

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:90%
in longevity research.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.634 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally isolated
because they found out

00:27:08.634 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that people in France who
ate port-- or drank-- port

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
wine, like really high
phenolic red wine--

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
like really intense--
lived to be like 110.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we
drink red wine, we'll

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:90%
be reversing aging. [LAUGHS]

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.736 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, I don't
want to say that.

00:27:22.736 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But somebody got
smart and said, what

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
the heck is in that red
wine that's doing this?

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they finally narrowed
it down to resveratrol,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
which is something very special.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting compound.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen that
come out in the market.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
You see when something
gets really popular,

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
there's 9 million products
with the name resveratrol

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:90%
in it and so forth.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that it
is a pretty-- but you

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
have to take a lot of it in
order for it to really work.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that the case with
the astragalus as well?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, if you could
isolate just that molecule,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.645 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't have to take much.

00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it depends
on the strength.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.053 align:middle line:90%
So it depends.

00:27:54.053 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Like if you had real wild
grapes like those right there

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and you juiced them
and you drank it,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.627 align:middle line:84%
you'd get a lot of
resveratrol in that drink.

00:28:00.627 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: If you do
it as a wine, you

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
could get-- if it's a dark
phenolic red wine-- you

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
can get a lot of resveratrol
in that port wine, for example.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.785 align:middle line:84%
However on a standard white
wine or whatever chardonnay

00:28:11.785 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
or something
somebody's drinking,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
there's not a whole lot
of resveratrol there.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I notice that a lot
of these pictures, you're

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.627 align:middle line:90%
wearing the poncho.

00:28:17.627 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.043 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we didn't
talk about the poncho.

00:28:20.043 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why this is
your standard uniform.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:90%
You're not a suit-and-tie guy.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.322 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: No.

00:28:24.322 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I do not wear suits and ties.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]
Where's the poncho from?

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is from the
region around Cusco in Peru--

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
the sacred city, the belly
button of South America.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about it is it's all

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:84%
made outside by women,
with their families

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and their animals,
next to a wild creek.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
When you see it, it's amazing.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact antithesis
of sweatshop labor.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:90%
It is the polar opposite.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.737 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you realize
that, like Dickens said,

00:28:52.737 --> 00:28:53.820 align:middle line:90%
"It was the best of times.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.944 align:middle line:90%
It was the worst of times."

00:28:54.944 --> 00:28:56.727 align:middle line:84%
Where we see the worst
of times going on,

00:28:56.727 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
that's the polar opposite.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.057 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most natural,
the most pure garment

00:29:02.057 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that has the longest history
of being made on the earth.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It's all natural dyes--
lapis, cochineal.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The blue
is lapis lazuli?

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yep.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The gem?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So they crush
the gem with water,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and they get that
blue color out.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.294 align:middle line:84%
And it does come out actually
if you crush the gem.

00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:20.742 align:middle line:84%
And then you soak the
alpaca wool in that,

00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:90%
and it takes on a blue color.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:90%
And you can see that it can fade

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a
gem poncho, too.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.375 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's a gem poncho.

00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It has all those sacred herbs
that they use in South America

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:90%
and Peru in here as a dye.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm wearing that.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wear this
stuff 'cause you feel it.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the energy
that comes from it,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
it will never fade because
it's right through and through.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And you said this one
was from an insect.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:90%
The red?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.448 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah, the cochineal.

00:29:48.448 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah it's an insect that
eats the prickly pear cactus.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of things too that
I love about this look

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.641 align:middle line:84%
is that Clint Eastwood
didn't go far enough.

00:29:56.641 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
He had a good look
going there for awhile,

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.765 align:middle line:84%
and he just didn't
go far enough.

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's one
thing I want to do.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to take it all way.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.958 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're aiming higher.

00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
I like that model.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So show me one of the other
ones, the place that you live.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.648 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's the forest
behind where I live.

00:30:11.648 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's out chaga hunting.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You can see my heavy
duty poncho right there.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:84%
That was about minus
20 degrees centigrade.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a lot of
different ponchos.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
They work really well for you.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.026 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:30:22.026 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.421 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love the woods.

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I love wild places.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a passion for plants,
and I love sharing that.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I love sharing
the possibilities

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of what's coming
down the pipeline.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.245 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm going to
request of everybody who's

00:30:32.245 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:84%
listening right now is,
you give me 15 years.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.055 align:middle line:84%
So you hang in
there for 15 years.

00:30:38.055 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
You do whatever you can do.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:90%
You do every exercise.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:90%
You do the best you can.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.761 align:middle line:90%
You do the organic foods.

00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:90%
You do superfoods.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
You do the herbs as best
you can for 15 years,

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
get you another 40.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.001 align:middle line:90%
That's my promise.

00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We'll figure out
how to do that for you.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.225 align:middle line:90%
It's gonna happen.

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
beautiful promise.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do now is we're

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
going to go-- David

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is such
a great thing-- is

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
he is going to be the
master blender chef.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have all
these ingredients

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.036 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to teach
us how to put together

00:31:07.036 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
these specific drinks
for balancing blood sugar

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and for improving
brain function.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
He's put his 20 years of
research and all of the places

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that he's gathered these
incredible, wild, harvested

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
herbs from and put them
into one drink-- two,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:90%
actually-- for you guys.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So get your pens and papers
ready and check this out.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.676 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With the incidents
of type 2 diabetes

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:84%
raising to epidemic
proportions, there

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is a need for something that
will balance blood sugar that

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
is in the form of a food--
and balance blood pressure.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
David Wolfe, who is the
master blender chef,

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to teach us how to make
a drink that actually balances

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:90%
blood pressure?

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And blood
sugar and builds blood.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.909 align:middle line:90%
So this is all about blood.

00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is groundbreaking.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:90%
For me, this is incredible.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, children
have this issue.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Pets have high blood pressure.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.377 align:middle line:84%
It's something that needs a
solution that's food based.

00:32:08.377 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:90%
We've gotta get it from food.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.115 align:middle line:84%
So it's like something
we're doing every day,

00:32:12.115 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to rely
on drugs to save our life.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.711 align:middle line:84%
We've gotta take it on
as a responsibility.

00:32:16.711 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do
this in addition?

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not saying get
off of your blood pressure

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:90%
medication.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.417 align:middle line:84%
Can do this in addition
to what you're taking?

00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Because really, these are foods.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
nothing really that's

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.825 align:middle line:84%
overtly, pharmacologically
too strong in any of this.

00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
This is food.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to be
building a drink that's

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:84%
food that's going
to build blood,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
help bring down that blood
sugar-- tone it down.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.739 align:middle line:84%
And help also bring
down the blood pressure.

00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is
ancient knowledge

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:90%
that food is medicinal.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a lot of these
things that are here-- I'm

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:90%
just looking at a few of them.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, these
have already been used.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, lucuma, cacao,
cashew, cayenne, and vanilla

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and salt have all been put into
formulas in Mexico and Central

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:90%
America for thousands of years.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.226 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The cacao is chocolate.

00:33:05.226 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is cacao or
chocolate in its raw form.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be the
fundamental basis of our drink

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.393 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:33:13.393 --> 00:33:14.895 align:middle line:90%
That's the cacao nut?

00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the cacao nut, sometimes
called a cacao bean or cocoa

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:90%
bean.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is the nut that all
chocolate is made out of.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
it looks like a brain.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it is one of the
best brain foods on Earth.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's not sweet.

00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind
of a mild taste.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not strong.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.726 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: For so many years,
people told me, you know,

00:33:35.726 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:84%
this isn't going to be a
good thing for the public.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.516 align:middle line:90%
It's too bitter.

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:41.137 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, millions of
people drink bitter coffee

00:33:41.137 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:90%
every morning.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.845 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:33:42.845 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So now we unleash the
raw chocolate revolution,

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and people eat these
straight and love them.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just did,
before [LAUGHS] I asked.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.272 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Because we like
bitter even though we've

00:33:52.272 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:84%
been so sugared
out that we've been

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:90%
trying to sugarcoat everything.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:90%
We do like bitter.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:56.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The bitter, the better.

00:33:56.825 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: The bitter, the better.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now this has-- is
loaded with magnesium, calcium.

00:34:01.924 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
highest sources

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:90%
on the planet of magnesium.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Of magnesium.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.691 align:middle line:84%
It's number one in magnesium of
any food on the planet, which

00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:09.475 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
blood mineral.

00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
alkaline mineral--

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
one of the most important.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is
that it's the highest

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
of any plant in
iron and manganese.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:84%
So iron and manganese
have to go together.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
That's like the big brother
and the little brother.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.683 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the magnesium
helps transport it

00:34:22.683 --> 00:34:23.690 align:middle line:90%
into the blood stream?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's actually
iron and manganese.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have magnesium, which
is something different-- which

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
is an important
alkaline mineral.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like calcium.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like that important.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But this also has
iron and manganese,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.500 align:middle line:84%
which is different
than magnesium.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.053 align:middle line:84%
Iron and manganese build
the blood chemistry.

00:34:41.053 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:84%
They build the
electricity of the blood.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They give you that charismatic,
powerful, magnetic activity

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.502 align:middle line:90%
of the blood.

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:49.251 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know what
I like about getting

00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:84%
your sources of iron from
foods is because the body will

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.005 align:middle line:84%
automatically regulate
how much it needs.

00:34:54.005 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.020 align:middle line:84%
That's how we're
supposed to be doing it.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what I would hope.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And chocolate-- I
mean, what better way

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to do it than to
just do chocolate?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is not
a struggle folks.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
This is something
you want to do.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.600 align:middle line:90%
What else about this?

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The Aztecs called cacao--
they had a slang for it which

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.862 align:middle line:84%
was yolotl etzli, and
that means "heart blood."

00:35:15.862 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And it had been
known for thousands

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of years that chocolate is
the best food for your blood,

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and it is by far the
best food for your heart.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.560 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
about all this.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.735 align:middle line:84%
This is amazingly
valuable heart food.

00:35:27.735 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It builds your heart.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they go hand
in hand, of course.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: They go hand in hand.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just going to
tell you a statistic that

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.677 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
shocking things ever.

00:35:34.677 --> 00:35:36.551 align:middle line:84%
It is the most shocking
thing ever discovered

00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
in the whole history
of all food as it

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
relates to being
active for our health.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.492 align:middle line:84%
And the number one killer in
our world is heart disease.

00:35:44.492 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease still
takes out more people

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.260 align:middle line:90%
than cancer, everything.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.667 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is number
one cause of death.

00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Research coming out
of the Netherlands

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
indicated when they studied
men 65, 70, 75, and 80

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that those who ate
the most chocolate

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.090 align:middle line:84%
had the least chance
of dying of any cause--

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.590 align:middle line:90%
especially heart attack.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They found out that
it decreased your risk

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.190 align:middle line:84%
if you eat
chocolate-- especially

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:84%
this kind of chocolate, raw
chocolate or dark chocolate.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking

I don't know what that stuff is.

00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:17.325 align:middle line:84%
I hope you never eat
that stuff ever again

00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:19.153 align:middle line:84%
or I hope you've never

00:36:19.153 --> 00:36:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't actually

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Does it?

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.082 align:middle line:84%
It's just a combination

00:36:23.082 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: They've

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
every last bit of
chocolate out of there.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They can't get rid of
cacao because there still

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.754 align:middle line:84%
has to be a little
bit in there, 'cause

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:84%
you can't mimic the
flavor artificially.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.424 align:middle line:90%
But they've tried.

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:90%
We're not trying that.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.423 align:middle line:90%
We're going the other way.

00:36:35.423 --> 00:36:37.674 align:middle line:90%
We want the actual flavor.

00:36:37.674 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about cacao

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is that this Dutch study found
that the more cacao you ate,

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.384 align:middle line:90%
the longer you lived.

00:36:44.384 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Now that's been known.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Cacao's number one
longevity food in the world.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:90%
How about that one?

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing
that's a shocker.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Cacao decreases your risk of

It has to have the cacao
flavonols in there.

00:37:02.563 --> 00:37:04.152 align:middle line:84%
It has to have
that dark pigment.

00:37:04.152 --> 00:37:05.985 align:middle line:84%

00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's the
best news ever.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's literally the
best news ever.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.996 align:middle line:90%
It's what you always wanted.

00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It's what we always
dreamed about.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And I will say this, all these
years people said, oh, no.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate bad.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And chocolate definitely
causes irrational behavior

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:90%
in people who don't eat it.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of a joke.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.101 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] I got it.

00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I found
for me personally,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.626 align:middle line:84%
the more and deeper
I've gotten into it,

00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:12.507 align:middle line:84%
it's actually totally
transformed my brain.

00:38:12.507 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
It totally transforms
the way I think.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.384 align:middle line:90%
It's actually made me smarter.

00:38:15.384 --> 00:38:17.675 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's really not--
I mean, chocolate the way

00:38:17.675 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that we know it is that
caramelized, vanilla, sugarized

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:90%
thing that comes in the bars.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the raw cacao--

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: This is the real deal.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --nut.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.607 align:middle line:90%
And you can eat this like candy.

00:38:27.607 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We're going to use
that as the first ingredient

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.773 align:middle line:90%
in our formula here.

00:38:30.773 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we get
this blender opened up,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and let's see what we got here.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our beautiful blender.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Look at
the Vanna of the blenders.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.038 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So we've got about
ten cacao beans in there.

00:38:42.038 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This could be cacao
powder- raw cacao powder.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It could be raw cacao nibs.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.360 align:middle line:90%
You like nibs.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I know you munch on
nibs all the time.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.240 align:middle line:90%
That's my study food.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Nibs.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.386 align:middle line:90%
I love those.

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: So great to study.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Just take a little of this
and just nibble at it.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.893 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they're called nibs

00:38:55.893 --> 00:38:57.810 align:middle line:84%
is 'cause they're these
pieces but broken up.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.899 align:middle line:84%
If I took this and I crush
it into a few pieces,

00:38:59.899 --> 00:39:00.440 align:middle line:90%
look at that.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Instant nibs.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
can just eat those.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.915 align:middle line:84%
Now does this have
caffeine in it?

00:39:04.915 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: There's very little
caffeine in chocolate.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact it's so little,
we've done three tests.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:90%
One test found nothing.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.780 align:middle line:84%
One test found 1/20
of what's in coffee.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And another test found
1/10 of what's in coffee.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So caffeine, it's
very de minimis

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:90%
aspect of what chocolate is.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They've been adding
caffeine to chocolate bars.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But cacao itself is a
poor source of caffeine.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to clarify that.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to just
throw that all in there.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got our
heart blood in there,

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.443 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to add
something else that's

00:39:40.443 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:84%
a very important part of
this whole blood drink

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:90%
that we're building.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And that is cashews.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.389 align:middle line:90%
Cashews are a complete protein.

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the latest
news on the street.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A complete
protein, meaning?

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: They are
a complete protein.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.575 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Meaning they have
all the essential amino acids,

00:39:54.575 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:84%
all eight amino acids--
or nine, depending

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:84%
on who you believe on essential
amino acids and protein.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're also very rich
in manganese and magnesium,

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
like cacao.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So they do have a
very long history

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:84%
in Central America and South
America being eaten with cacao.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're a great carrier.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:90%
They carry the flavor.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So they're a great
blood builder as well.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.153 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to put
some cashews in there.

00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:90%
How much?

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, just enough to make
this the best drink ever.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cashews and chocolate.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.364 align:middle line:84%
So far, we're off
to a great start.

00:40:24.364 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And then we
got this over here.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to add
this last, of course.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
You know how I do things?

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.821 align:middle line:84%
Let's get all the powders
and the foods in their first,

00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and then we put in
our coconut water.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:84%
This is coconut water,
which-- if you've

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:84%
heard the rumor--
back in World War I

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:43.256 align:middle line:84%
and even in the Japanese war in
the South Pacific, when troops

00:40:43.256 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:84%
were injured, they
would actually

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
use coconut water
as blood plasma.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually put
an IV of coconut water

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.432 align:middle line:84%
up and then drip it into
somebody's blood directly.

00:40:53.432 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it has the same
nutrients that mimic blood.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yep.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.850 align:middle line:90%
It's blood plasma.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:84%
There's your blood
plasma right there.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.090 align:middle line:90%
You need to build blood?

00:40:59.090 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.761 align:middle line:90%
There's your coconut water.

00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Minerals--

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Electrolytes.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.238 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --amino acids,
electrolytes, potassium.

00:41:04.238 --> 00:41:05.917 align:middle line:90%
All that's in-- sodium?

00:41:05.917 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: A little bit of sodium.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.304 align:middle line:84%
So this is really better
than any sports drink.

00:41:09.304 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I've got news for you.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And I did that research.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I put it in my
"Superfoods" book.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
whole bunch of research

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.830 align:middle line:84%
out there comparing sports
drinks to coconut water,

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.794 align:middle line:90%
and nature does it better.

00:41:19.794 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Nature does it better.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Ann Wigmore, in the old
days, used to use coconut water

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and then wheatgrass juice.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Green juice-- like celery juice,
parsley juice, cilantro juice,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.915 align:middle line:84%
wheatgrass juice-- is also
an excellent blood builder.

00:41:33.915 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we had a juicer out here,
we'd be doing it that way too.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So you can do both of those.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're dealing with-- for
example, a friend of mine

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:90%
was bleeding for 60 days.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:84%
She had a miscarriage,
bled for 60 days.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And she basically did like
chlorella, spirulina, cacao--

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that was her
thing-- for 60 days.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.905 align:middle line:84%
And she's a vegan, so she's
beyond even vegetarian.

00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:56.772 align:middle line:84%
She's a vegan and did
not become anemic.

00:41:56.772 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.030 align:middle line:90%
To rebuild the blood to--

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's how
powerful this is.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Just so we know.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful this is.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So back to the coconut,
if you've ever-- of course,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
you have-- opened
up a coconut and you

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.780 align:middle line:84%
get that beautiful
water from inside,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.590 align:middle line:84%
you can use it on your
hair and your skin.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
You could just pour the
thing all over yourself.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.743 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the best ever.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.812 align:middle line:84%
Coconut water is like
heaven's own reward.

00:42:20.812 --> 00:42:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the great things.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's how you know
you're in paradise.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
our vision of paradise.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.160 align:middle line:90%
We're in paradise.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:26.150 align:middle line:90%
We're on a beach.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:90%
What are we drinking?

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:90%
A coconut.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.105 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:29.105 --> 00:42:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Alright, I'll be back.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.025 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:42:32.025 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Actually you
can stay, because we're

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.024 align:middle line:90%
going to put that in there.

00:42:35.024 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make a
chocolate, coconut blood drink.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This is so important
to get this idea

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
about chocolate and
blood and blood building.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.724 align:middle line:84%
That's to me is--
people do not know that.

00:42:44.724 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Like in the world,
it's not known.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's because
of the way that we

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.710 align:middle line:84%
have the image of
chocolate in our minds.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: RIght.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's like that candy
and whatever that was.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go back over to here.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Lucuma.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lucuma.

00:42:54.145 --> 00:42:55.853 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Lucuma has
been eaten with cacao

00:42:55.853 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-glycemic
sweetener, so it

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.366 align:middle line:90%
doesn't spike your blood sugar.

00:43:01.366 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a fruit?

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's an
eggfruit, canistel.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
One of of favorite
fruits to grow.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%
I grow it.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.225 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely enamored
with this fruit.

00:43:07.225 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does it look like--
is it like gray on the outside?

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:10.560 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.715 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It can be
orange on the outside.

00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It can be brownish
on the outside.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Depends on the variety.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It can be really
smooth-skinned on the outside.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.689 align:middle line:84%
And it's related to
the mamey sapote,

00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:90%
if you know what that is.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people from
Cuba, Cuban descent.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They're like, oh, mamey.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.360 align:middle line:84%
We know what that is. 'Cause
that's the fruit of Cuba.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the queen of
all fruits in Cuba.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
put that in here.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to give
us delightful flavor.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:90%
It's an emulsifier.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring these oils
from the cacao and the cashew

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.371 align:middle line:84%
together with all of these
disparate elements that we

00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have. 'Cause you know, we've
got a lot of interesting things

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to make
it work together.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
more for flavor,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.662 align:middle line:90%
and you can use it as a food.

00:43:47.662 --> 00:43:49.620 align:middle line:84%
What would you use that
in terms of-- could you

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.650 align:middle line:90%
use it for baking?

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Could use it for--

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.243 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely can
bake cakes with it.

00:43:53.243 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And they use it for ice cream in
South America quite regularly.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
ingredient in ice cream.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Great for
sugar substitute?

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.370 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially for
diabetics who are looking--

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Very good.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --low-glycemic food.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.849 align:middle line:84%
So for blood sugars,
we're not going

00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:90%
to add anything sweet here.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:84%
This is just coconut
water, and the lucuma

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to be kind of
adding that low glycemic piece

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to our puzzle to
make it taste good.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got chaga
and reishi mycelium

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and through the
Longevity Warehouse,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.730 align:middle line:84%
which is the company that
distributes my stuff,

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.099 align:middle line:84%
we developed a number
of very cool products.

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I like this product
because it gives people

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.894 align:middle line:90%
their money's worth.

00:44:28.894 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking
at all of this,

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at really
pennies in a bowl.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.432 align:middle line:84%
You know, $13 for
a bag of chlorella.

00:44:34.432 --> 00:44:35.890 align:middle line:84%
That's just a little
bit of it so--

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
for a whole bag.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: The whole bag.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.546 align:middle line:90%
This is just one little bit.

00:44:39.546 --> 00:44:42.282 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can make
these drinks for under $1.

00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is close
to about $1 worth.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only thing
that's actually expensive

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:90%
here is actually the cashews.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.739 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is very
inexpensive-- especially

00:44:49.739 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:90%
in this form.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.612 align:middle line:84%
When you buy it in bulk
off the internet is great.

00:44:52.612 --> 00:44:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we do that
through our Longevity

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Warehouse is we want to
be able to get people bulk

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
powders of these
medicinal mushrooms.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.489 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having to go
through all those capsules.

00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:84%
All those capsules
are just too much.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you really
emptied all those out,

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:90%
that'd be a really small amount.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.150 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a
health food store

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.296 align:middle line:84%
and you buy a little
bottle of reishi mushroom,

00:45:10.296 --> 00:45:12.545 align:middle line:84%
by the time you get the 60
capsules out there and open

00:45:12.545 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
'em, you've got about
maybe that much.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:16.850 align:middle line:90%
You don't have much.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're going to
put all that into one drink.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: All that's
going in there.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
the chaga mushroom?

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:22.103 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Chaga and reishi.

00:45:22.103 --> 00:45:23.580 align:middle line:90%
That's king and queen.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: King and queen
in the mushroom family.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: King and queen.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.900 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
king and queen,

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:84%
it's good to have the prince
around, but you don't need it.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But why are they?

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
What are their functionalities?

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: They're the powerful
immunological substances

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Immunological.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.866 align:middle line:84%
They're also great for
our nervous system.

00:45:37.866 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:84%
They feed our brain,
and they're really

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
important for our joints.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.770 align:middle line:84%
They contain the same
types of materials

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
as you would find in glucosamine
chondroitin, for example.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.435 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:45:47.435 --> 00:45:48.789 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's nature's form.

00:45:48.789 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: This is nature's form.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, is
a very big advance

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:84%
in herbalism to get it in
this powdered form like this.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We call it reishi
mycelium or chaga

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:84%
mycelium That's
that powdered form.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
is just the pure--

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle line:84%
it's not filled with anything

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do anything.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.924 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make a tea out of it.

00:46:06.924 --> 00:46:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You just throw the powder
in or you just eat it.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Kids can eat it.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:90%
It tastes good.

have any fillers.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.760 align:middle line:90%

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:46.939 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:46.939 --> 00:46:49.964 align:middle line:84%
It's like something from
another planet or-- It's crazy.

00:46:49.964 --> 00:46:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
naturally that green?

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.838 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's
naturally that green.

00:46:52.838 --> 00:46:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's 40 times higher than
wheatgrass in chlorophyll.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.802 align:middle line:90%
Purpose of chlorophyll is?

00:46:58.802 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Chlorophyll is
identical to hemoglobin

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.670 align:middle line:84%
except with one
mineral difference.

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.802 align:middle line:84%
In your blood, your
hemoglobin, it's

00:47:04.802 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:84%
iron that's at the center of
the exact same molecule that's

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.650 align:middle line:90%
the shape of chlorophyll.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And in a plant, there's
just magnesium in there.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Now they hired the
top four scientists

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.120 align:middle line:84%
in this area to figure out
when the switch happens.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat chlorophyll
and it converts to blood,

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.845 align:middle line:84%
when does the magnesium get
[SNAPS FINGERS AND MAKES A

00:47:19.845 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:84%
POPPING SOUND] popped out
and when does the iron

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.640 align:middle line:84%
get [SNAPS FINGERS AND MAKES A
 POPPING SOUND] popped in?

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Three of the four said they
couldn't figure it out.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one said--
this is what he actually

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.460 align:middle line:84%
concluded-- the magnesium
is turned into iron, which

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.420 align:middle line:90%
is a major faux pas in science.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.992 align:middle line:84%
That's how mysterious
this stuff is, really.

00:47:36.992 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This does that?

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.260 align:middle line:90%
So this basically builds blood?

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Whenever you see
green like that, that's blood.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:90%
That's blood.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
that from now on.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see
green foods, whenever

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
you see super green
juices, whenever

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.684 align:middle line:84%
you see green powders-- I
just want you to think blood.

00:47:51.684 --> 00:47:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why would
something like this

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.960 align:middle line:84%
be better than a green,
like a kale spinach juice?

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Great question.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason is
because this has 40 times

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.180 align:middle line:84%
or more chlorophyll in
it than a kale juice.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I love green juices.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But you'd have to drink
40 times the amount

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.245 align:middle line:84%
to get that dosage
of chlorophyll.

00:48:09.245 --> 00:48:10.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:10.376 --> 00:48:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's very
cost-effective right there.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is why, like
with the kids that I coach

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and that I hang out with,
we got 'em on chlorophyll.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.270 align:middle line:90%
We got 'em on chlorella.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.140 align:middle line:90%
They have to be.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Because breathing all this
fumes of cars and exhaust

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and everything, you
have to have something

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that detoxifies
your system of that.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:27.997 align:middle line:90%
Chlorophyll does that.

00:48:27.997 --> 00:48:29.413 align:middle line:84%
What about the
blood of your life?

00:48:29.413 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:90%
The river of your life?

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.807 align:middle line:90%
Your bloodstream?

00:48:31.807 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, river's
a great analogy,

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.825 align:middle line:84%
because it takes out
the toxins as it builds.

00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's exactly it.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a river, so it's
got to be cleansed.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:39.940 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.500 align:middle line:84%
What builds and
cleanses your blood?

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:90%
That right there.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can it cleanse
fat out of the blood?

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Good question.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to that.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, sorry.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:46.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I just wondering
because-- I mean,

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that's something that really
causes a lot of heart disease

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.899 align:middle line:84%
is the fat in the
blood and so forth.

00:48:53.899 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Let me tell
you what does do that.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Goji berries and cacao and
bell peppers do do that.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing research at
the University of Arizona

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:84%
on goji berries, and I came
across this research article

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that ended up in my
"Superfoods" book.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And in there, it talked
about cacao and goji berries

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and bell peppers
have this property

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of protecting and shielding
your cardiovascular system

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.410 align:middle line:84%
from fatty deposits
gluing themselves

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
on in certain points.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, in your
coronary artery,

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.280 align:middle line:90%
which can cause heart disease.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.407 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So cacao,
goji berries, and--

00:49:23.407 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: And bell peppers.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:25.614 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and bell peppers.

00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:27.420 align:middle line:84%
What's the property
in there that

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.400 align:middle line:84%
doesn't allow the
fat to coagulate.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's two compounds
actually, and one of them

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.790 align:middle line:84%
is related to the
methylxanthines,

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:90%
if you can remember that.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He knows everything.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.759 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're amazing.

00:49:40.759 --> 00:49:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: One of them is
related to the methylxanthines,

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.965 align:middle line:84%
and the other's
related to dopamine.

00:49:44.965 --> 00:49:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's like EPA dopamine.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.618 align:middle line:84%
It's a similar
compound to dopamine

00:49:49.618 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that has this property of-- it's
like an anti-caking property.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It keeps the oils in
your blood from gluing

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:90%
onto your cardiovascular system.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why cacao may be the
most powerful anti-aging,

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.200 align:middle line:84%
heart-friendly,
cardiovascular-friendly food

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.060 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So actually, you
just mentioned a great word--

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.950 align:middle line:90%
longevity, anti-aging.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.142 align:middle line:90%
What we're doing here is we're--

00:50:11.142 --> 00:50:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is
serious longevity stuff.

>>LISA: Reversing the

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.005 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We're about to put

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's where it

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:90%
The He Shou Wu.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a Chinese herb.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.150 align:middle line:90%
This is about Mr. Ho.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Ho was infertile.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.070 align:middle line:90%
He was 50 years old.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.720 align:middle line:90%
He could not father children.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is a true story?

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: This is a true story.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It comes out of China.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a legend behind this herb.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was is one
day he'd lost all his hair.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.450 align:middle line:90%
He turned gray.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.660 align:middle line:90%
He was impotent, infertile.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it was
the worst news ever.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That's basically the
worst situation ever.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And this plant kept talking
to him on his way home

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:54.917 align:middle line:90%
from work every day.

00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And one day he went
to this herbalist.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.977 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
plant is talking to me.

00:50:58.977 --> 00:50:59.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into plants.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't get why this
plant is talking to me.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the herbalist
said, oh, oh, oh.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a plant that has
these properties like this,

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.430 align:middle line:90%
this, this.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.304 align:middle line:90%
It makes you younger.

00:51:08.304 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Helps you grow your hair back.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Turns your hair from
gray back to dark.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Increases your longevity.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Increases your potency.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Increases your fertility.

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, that's
exactly what I need.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So he started doing mega
amounts of this herb.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Now this is one of the most
non-toxic foods on Earth.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, no matter how
much of this you eat,

you can't kill yourself.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing
studies on mice with this.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:84%
They can put, literally,
the mouse's weight--

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:84%
injected-- of this material
into the mouse per day.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And the mouse will still
not die-- or even be toxic.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's He
Shou Wu or Fo-Ti.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
builds bone marrow?

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Builds bone marrow.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a bone marrow
building food.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.396 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:52:05.396 --> 00:52:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense if we're
talking about building blood.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:07.296 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Blood.

00:52:07.296 --> 00:52:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's gotta have
He Shou Wu in it.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:09.870 align:middle line:90%
I put this recipe together.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, you gotta
have that in there.

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:15.125 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what I do for myself
every day, a drink like this.

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thinking
that's behind it too,

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.458 align:middle line:84%
because I found
out over the years,

00:52:18.458 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:84%
it's all about
attention and intention.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:23.414 align:middle line:90%
Attention and intention.

00:52:23.414 --> 00:52:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And with
things like this,

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:28.180 align:middle line:84%
with these types of drinks,
you don't need large meals.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.799 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Oh, you don't
even need to eat at all.

00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I went for months without eating
anything-- just doing these.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.800 align:middle line:84%
When I first really kind of
cracked the code of like, oh,

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.299 align:middle line:90%
wait.

00:52:36.299 --> 00:52:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate's the delivery
system for all this stuff.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I got on the
full-on chocolate drinks--

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Mayan style the way the
Aztecs and the Mayans

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Toltecs and the
Olmecs and the Mixtecs

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.039 align:middle line:84%
had been doing it for
thousands of years.

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It was like all this
world opened up.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I went like three months

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.118 align:middle line:90%
without even eating anything.

00:52:51.118 --> 00:52:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I just drank stuff.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:55.617 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this could also
promote weight loss, which

00:52:55.617 --> 00:52:57.700 align:middle line:84%
would also help with the
diabetes which would also

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.880 align:middle line:90%
help with the heart disease.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.715 align:middle line:84%
And so it kind of
is all-inclusive.

00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.245 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of food.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:03.720 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.130 align:middle line:84%
When we drink this,
it's like this is food.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:90%
This is substance.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not so pretty
right now, but I'm

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.660 align:middle line:90%
sure it's going to get better.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.784 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: So you'll feel it.

00:53:10.784 --> 00:53:11.501 align:middle line:90%
You'll be full.

00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:90%
It's looking good.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:12.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Now next one's cinnamon.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.320 align:middle line:84%
We gotta have cinnamon,
because cinnamon's-- you know,

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.120 align:middle line:90%
it's chromium.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Cacao and chromium, by the
way-- cacao and cinnamon

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.960 align:middle line:84%
are the highest in chromium
of any foods in the world.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.501 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so also tell me a
little bit more about cinnamon.

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
People might not
know that it also

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.680 align:middle line:84%
has-- I just
mentioned weight loss.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.850 align:middle line:84%
That I heard something about
it having weight loss effects?

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It has
weight loss effects.

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that true?

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:32.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well chromium,
it shuts off your appestat

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:90%
like magnesium does.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.594 align:middle line:84%
So if you get enough
chromium, you stop eating.

00:53:40.594 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
ways that cacao works.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Cacao's super rich in
magnesium and chromium.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as your body gets
that, the appestat shuts off.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the appetite
signal in the brain?

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's your appetite
signal in your brain.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.536 align:middle line:84%
There's another
piece of this too.

00:53:51.536 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is cinnamon is very
anti-fungal, anti-microbial,

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:90%
anti-candida.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So part of what goes
on with candida,

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.660 align:middle line:84%
as you know 'cause you're
friends with Donna Gates,

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is that you've got little
critters in there going,

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.130 align:middle line:90%
we want the sugar.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.990 align:middle line:90%
We want the garbage.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.070 align:middle line:90%
We want the junk.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:08.117 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Makes them grow.

00:54:08.117 --> 00:54:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So then they want
certain types of foods.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.616 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you go, wait.

00:54:11.616 --> 00:54:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I really want junk food.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:13.935 align:middle line:90%
You see it affects--

00:54:13.935 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why
you crave the sugars.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: We crave the sugars.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
feeding the parasites.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So cinnamon is one
of the great anti-fungal,

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.980 align:middle line:84%
antimicrobial herbs
on earth that we

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.560 align:middle line:84%
know about that's
available to us.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we put that in, it starts
to fight the critters back

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and kills off their appetite.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.137 align:middle line:84%
Because if they get
killed back, then

00:54:29.137 --> 00:54:30.970 align:middle line:84%
you don't get a strong
enough signal anymore

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that breaks through your
consciousness and goes,

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.159 align:middle line:90%
let me eat junk.

00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you want to get the
ground cinnamon or something--

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you could--

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: I like whole cinnamon.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.134 align:middle line:84%
I like ground
cinnamon sometimes,

00:54:40.134 --> 00:54:41.617 align:middle line:90%
but I like whole cinnamon.

00:54:41.617 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll just throw
little chunk in there,

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and the blender will
just disintegrate it.

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:46.776 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:54:46.776 --> 00:54:48.234 align:middle line:84%
That's great to
know about cinnamon

00:54:48.234 --> 00:54:50.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
readily available.

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: The smell's
just-- gah, it's good.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:54:52.755 --> 00:54:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It does smell good.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:56.235 align:middle line:90%
Now, vanilla bean.

00:54:56.235 --> 00:54:57.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little
bit of vanilla

00:54:57.610 --> 00:54:59.262 align:middle line:90%
here to bottom out the formula.

00:54:59.262 --> 00:54:59.970 align:middle line:90%
We got chocolate.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:00.928 align:middle line:90%
You gotta have vanilla.

00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ooh.

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate, vanilla, and cashews.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We're making a-- this
is a blood tonic?

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is
the best news ever.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would think
it would be something

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.515 align:middle line:84%
really harsh and
not great tasting.

00:55:11.515 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you've got a lot
of great elements in here.

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I want to
tell you about vanilla.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been to something really
interesting with vanilla.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.170 align:middle line:84%
We're running a
chocolate farm in Hawaii,

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.105 align:middle line:84%
and one day I'm
looking at my trees.

00:55:21.105 --> 00:55:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole
bunch of vanillas,

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.220 align:middle line:90%
'cause vanilla's an orchid.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.051 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a bunch
going in our nursery.

00:55:26.051 --> 00:55:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And one day I'm
like, wait a second.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate and vanilla.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate and vanilla.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.895 align:middle line:84%
So I-- what you do with vanilla
is you take the orchid out

00:55:34.895 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:84%
there, and you
hang it in a tree.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.247 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, let's hang
'em in the cacao trees.

00:55:38.247 --> 00:55:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So we went out there, and
we hung all the vanillas

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:41.121 align:middle line:90%
in the cacao trees.

00:55:41.121 --> 00:55:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got chocolate and
vanilla growing together.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.050 align:middle line:90%
They grow together.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Oh my goodness.

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:50.594 align:middle line:90%
I love the way you live.

00:55:50.594 --> 00:55:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That was an incredible
experience, I have to say.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.127 align:middle line:84%
When that clicked
and it was like, oh.

00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how it's
supposed to be done.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.106 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
growing that together.

00:55:59.106 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Have you manifested
anything from it

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.781 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
able to taste yet?

00:56:02.781 --> 00:56:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: The vanillas
haven't fruited yet.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But the plan is is that we'll
have single-tree chocolate

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.240 align:middle line:84%
bars, so the entire thing
comes from that tree.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not like single
estate origin, terroir,

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.476 align:middle line:90%
or these things.

00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:17.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
chocolate aficionado,

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:18.750 align:middle line:90%
you know what I'm talking about.

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.344 align:middle line:84%
If you're not, you
probably don't.

00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really into
like high-grade chocolate,

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
there's like single-origin
or single-estate or terroir

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.264 align:middle line:84%
that are like single
types of cacao.

00:56:29.264 --> 00:56:30.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going even
one step further.

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.454 align:middle line:84%
We're going single-tree
chocolate bars

00:56:32.454 --> 00:56:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and all the vanilla comes
from that tree, too.

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All you need
to know is if you

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.790 align:middle line:84%
want to be anything
like this guy,

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:38.581 align:middle line:84%
just listen to what he
has to say. [LAUGHS]

00:56:38.581 --> 00:56:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Got an amazing amount of energy.

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's the future.

00:56:41.175 --> 00:56:43.460 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is is
like wines are now

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and all of that tremendous
explosion of interest in wine

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.800 align:middle line:84%
tasting and all
that, that's where

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.417 align:middle line:84%
chocolate's going
to be in 10 years.

00:56:50.417 --> 00:56:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That quick.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:52.788 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Chocolate bars?

00:56:52.788 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yep.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:55.253 align:middle line:90%
That sounds great.

00:56:55.253 --> 00:56:55.836 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:56:55.836 --> 00:56:58.777 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the thinking
of vanilla and how you do it.

00:56:58.777 --> 00:57:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got a
little bit of cayenne.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.693 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have that 'cause
cayenne's all about blood.

00:57:02.693 --> 00:57:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You want to thin your
blood-- you can save yourself

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:84%
if you're having a
heart attack, sometimes

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.390 align:middle line:90%
by mega amounts of cayenne.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really good to know that.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.690 align:middle line:90%
It's Dr. Schulze.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.295 align:middle line:90%
He was the guy who told us that.

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:13.980 align:middle line:84%
That if you do mega
amounts of cayenne

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:16.269 align:middle line:84%
during a heart attack episode,
you can save your life.

00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's an amazing healer.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's an amazing,
powerful substance.

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Incredible properties.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I was one time in
an airport in Costa Rica

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.079 align:middle line:84%
and I was hunting around for
honey 'cause we had cacao

00:57:25.079 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and we had cayenne.

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.953 align:middle line:90%
And so I found this honey.

00:57:26.953 --> 00:57:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We come back, and we're dippin'
the cacao bean into the honey

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.382 align:middle line:84%
then into the cayenne
then eating it.

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:33.965 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why
you don't eat food.

00:57:33.965 --> 00:57:34.548 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:57:34.548 --> 00:57:35.048 align:middle line:90%
Try that.

00:57:35.048 --> 00:57:36.506 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But this
has-- you can also

00:57:36.506 --> 00:57:38.500 align:middle line:84%
put it directly on,
sometimes, on your skin.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.735 align:middle line:84%
If you have a very bad
gash, you put cayenne.

00:57:40.735 --> 00:57:42.180 align:middle line:90%
You pack it right in there.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the women who runs my
farm, she gashed her hand.

00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:47.060 align:middle line:84%
11 stitches right
here is what she

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.860 align:middle line:84%
would have needed as
she found out later.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.510 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't get any stitches.

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.470 align:middle line:84%
She gashed her hand
on a piece of glass,

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.130 align:middle line:90%
all the way across right there.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I packed it with cayenne.

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I packed it with noni.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I packed it with MSM.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I packed it with vitamin
C, after cleaning it out

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.510 align:middle line:90%
with colloidal silver.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And then wrapped it
really, really tight.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The next day we
cleaned it out again.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Packed all those herbs back in--
the cayenne, the noni, the MSM,

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the vitamin C. And and
then wrapped it up again.

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:15.270 align:middle line:84%
About three days after
that, she finally

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:16.415 align:middle line:90%
went and had it looked at.

00:58:16.415 --> 00:58:18.415 align:middle line:84%
And they basically said
she didn't need stitches

00:58:18.415 --> 00:58:22.680 align:middle line:84%
at that point, but she probably
would have needed 11 stitches.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's how powerful
this kind of stuff can be.

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It will heal.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.102 align:middle line:84%
It will draw the
tissue back together.

00:58:29.102 --> 00:58:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's interesting
because that's really,

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.900 align:middle line:84%
you could see the blood
building proponents in action

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.470 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right there.

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:35.465 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:58:35.465 --> 00:58:37.375 align:middle line:84%
That really alarmed me.
'Cause I thought, OK.

00:58:37.375 --> 00:58:38.750 align:middle line:84%
At least we stopped
the bleeding.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Everything's cool.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.314 align:middle line:84%
But that she didn't actually get
the stitches later was a sign

00:58:44.314 --> 00:58:46.730 align:middle line:84%
of how powerful foods and herbs
can be -- and supplements.

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:47.688 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's cell food.

00:58:47.688 --> 00:58:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Cell food.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.766 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
take a pinch of cayenne.

00:58:50.766 --> 00:58:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Just get a little bit in there.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.742 align:middle line:90%
Do you like it hot?

00:58:53.742 --> 00:58:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, yeah.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:55.681 align:middle line:90%
I'm into hot.

00:58:55.681 --> 00:58:56.930 align:middle line:90%
So let's do a little bit more.

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:57.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.241 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to do a pinch of salt.

00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Salt brings out
sweetness-- not sugariness.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a non-sweetened
drink, so we

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.395 align:middle line:84%
want to bring out the
sweetness but not a sugariness.

00:59:06.395 --> 00:59:07.410 align:middle line:90%
So salt does that.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it also
provides potassium and--

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.284 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

00:59:09.284 --> 00:59:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And it bottoms out a
lot of these raw foods.

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.386 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these raw foods
are very rich in potassium,

00:59:13.386 --> 00:59:15.070 align:middle line:84%
so we need to
balance with sodium.

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.595 align:middle line:90%
I like sea salt, by the way.

00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:17.712 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:59:17.712 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Talk about salts.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of salts
out there right now.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:21.754 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
salt in your body.

00:59:21.754 --> 00:59:24.440 align:middle line:84%
'Cause you're not a
river; you're an ocean.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.945 align:middle line:90%
Your tissues are salty.

00:59:25.945 --> 00:59:27.507 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The blood's the river.

00:59:27.507 --> 00:59:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:28.780 align:middle line:90%
The blood is the river.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But I mean like if we think
about a river or a creek--

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're here in Colorado
where there's creeks going by.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Our blood isn't like that.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It's actually salty.

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
we want to make sure

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.470 align:middle line:84%
we have a little bit of salt
in there somewhere in our diet.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.720 align:middle line:84%
If we're oversalted, we've
got to go off the salt.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Let it flush out of our system.

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point,
we have to go back

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.980 align:middle line:84%
onto the right kind of
salt, which is sea salt.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm glad you said that,
because diabetic condition,

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.940 align:middle line:84%
they usually tell you
to stay away from salt.

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Yeah, 'cause
you've gotta get off of it.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:56.950 align:middle line:90%
For sometimes years.

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:90%
But forever?

00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:59.540 align:middle line:90%
That's a big jump.

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:00.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.490 align:middle line:90%
We've gotta get off for years.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:02.830 align:middle line:90%
But forever?

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:03.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a jump.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.436 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you
do need a little bit

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:07.100 align:middle line:84%
of the right type
of salt in your body

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.697 align:middle line:84%

out the blood.

01:00:08.697 --> 01:00:09.530 align:middle line:90%

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.901 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what you're saying.

01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:10.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.048 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Exactly.

01:00:11.048 --> 01:00:12.390 align:middle line:90%
To balance out the potassium.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Potassium's a great healer
if you're oversalted.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:16.301 align:middle line:84%
It's going to flush all
that salt out of you.

01:00:16.301 --> 01:00:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Raw foods.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.400 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.233 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you get
ahold of a salty meal.

01:00:19.233 --> 01:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But that's if you're eating food
ever after this entire demo.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.593 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

01:00:22.593 --> 01:00:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you may want to do
this for like a day, a week,

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.405 align:middle line:90%
a month-- for years.

01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:26.905 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:26.905 --> 01:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to put
the coconut water in now,

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be ready
to blend that thing up.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.030 align:middle line:84%

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
this would be hard to
get out of the walls.

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.825 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:50.825 --> 01:00:52.867 align:middle line:84%
These are foods that they
make clothes dyes from.

01:00:52.867 --> 01:00:53.783 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's right.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:54.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:55.388 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:00:55.388 --> 01:00:56.054 align:middle line:90%
We're launching.

01:00:56.054 --> 01:01:03.509 align:middle line:90%


01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:04.503 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: High.

01:01:04.503 --> 01:01:06.985 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We're gonna just get
those cashews all completely

01:01:06.985 --> 01:01:07.485 align:middle line:90%
ground down.

01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:08.976 align:middle line:84%
The cacao completely
ground down.

01:01:08.976 --> 01:01:10.268 align:middle line:90%
This is going to taste amazing.

01:01:10.268 --> 01:01:11.809 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm just
going to hold it on.

01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:12.455 align:middle line:90%
Hold it on?

01:01:12.455 --> 01:01:14.246 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is going
to be extraordinary.

01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:15.437 align:middle line:90%
We'll need a couple of cups.

01:01:15.437 --> 01:01:17.381 align:middle line:90%
We'll need a couple glasses.

01:01:17.381 --> 01:01:17.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:22.211 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Looks like we've got those
cashews completely broken down.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's get some cups in here.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.688 align:middle line:84%
Coming in from our
studio audience.

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we got.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.162 align:middle line:90%
So this one will be for you.

01:01:36.162 --> 01:01:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Milkshakey.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It looks like-- yeah.

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you blend in all the--
Cheers to the best day ever.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
The best drink ever.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You're
bloody well right.

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.189 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Come on.

01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:54.021 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good!

01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Come on!

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.075 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's really good.

01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:58.977 align:middle line:84%
Got a little kick in
there from the cayenne.

01:01:58.977 --> 01:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: By the way, the
cayenne comes to the top.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.895 align:middle line:84%
It comes into the head, just
so you're aware of that.

01:02:03.895 --> 01:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll
get a little bit

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.550 align:middle line:90%
of a blast in that first pass.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.040 align:middle line:90%
But deeper in, it's not there.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
That is so good.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.045 align:middle line:84%
It really does taste
like a milkshake.

01:02:12.045 --> 01:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is
like St. Patty's Day.

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Green?

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's got a little
bit of texture to it, too.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.690 align:middle line:90%
This is a complete meal.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're balancing
your blood sugar.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You've put no sugar or
artificial ingredients

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:27.810 align:middle line:90%
into your body at all.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And these are things that
David, through his 20

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
years of research with
all this, has put together

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:36.395 align:middle line:84%
through his own
exclusive experience.

01:02:36.395 --> 01:02:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're really, really
fortunate to have you.

01:02:39.645 --> 01:02:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This to me is
like when I was a kid,

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.993 align:middle line:84%
my uncle showed me how
to use a blender when

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I was four years old.

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're using Minute
Maid frozen orange juice

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.850 align:middle line:90%
and throwing ice in there.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was the original thing.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But all these years, I've been
developing my blender skills.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I always think about my
uncle getting me into this.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And look what
you've done though.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And then we've
gotten it to here.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
This is where we are now.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And look what you've
brought all the communities out

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:00.940 align:middle line:90%
there, and people's health.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
You've brought so
much information to us

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that we would not
regularly know about.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.549 align:middle line:84%
And so I appreciate you
bringing all this to the world.

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Thank you.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Cheers.

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:10.853 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:16.011 align:middle line:90%


01:03:16.011 --> 01:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So who doesn't need a
little more brain power?

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Who doesn't want to get
rid of that foggy thinking

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.220 align:middle line:90%
or have a better memory?

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Be able to be sharper,
more on your game.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is master
blender chef David Wolfe,

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
be putting together

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
a drink that has to do with
boosting your brain power.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And how exactly does that work?

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously not brain
here that we're taking.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, there's
an unwritten assumption

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.238 align:middle line:84%
about all this that we're
going to create here.

01:03:46.238 --> 01:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is we're
doing something.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
That means we're not
doing something else.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's important is we can
use that crowding-out principle

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.707 align:middle line:84%
to regain our brain
power, regain our health.

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Just do the healthy
things, and it naturally

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.000 align:middle line:90%
crowds out the unhealthy things.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's really
ultimately about circulation.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Getting blood to the
brain, oxygen to the brain.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's part of what's
going to happen here for sure.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.174 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
first thing is what

01:04:08.174 --> 01:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to be doing.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're not
going to be clouding

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.179 align:middle line:84%
the brain with a
bunch of heavy toxins.

01:04:12.179 --> 01:04:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: And gluey stuff.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:13.803 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
clearing the pathways.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.755 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
increasing circulation

01:04:17.755 --> 01:04:20.125 align:middle line:84%
with this wonderful
brain booster drink.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is, by
the way, something

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can do at any time.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.280 align:middle line:90%
You can do this before a test.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.529 align:middle line:84%
If you need to have a
high-performance thinking

01:04:28.529 --> 01:04:29.070 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go to
the market and you

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.998 align:middle line:84%
want to remember
your grocery list.

01:04:31.998 --> 01:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is
always-- it's always

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
great to have high
brain functionality.

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
'Cause then, of
course, you're happier.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That is right.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.116 align:middle line:90%
And you can get things done.

01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I notice that
when my brain is really sharp,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
the thought shows up
just a second before,

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm speaking,
but the thought

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is already there of the second
thing that's going to happen

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.133 align:middle line:90%
and the third thing.

01:04:49.133 --> 01:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're not
searching for words, names.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So you're
on top of your game.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:54.868 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're
going to do is we're

01:04:54.868 --> 01:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
going to make an almond
milk-based type of beverage

01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.424 align:middle line:84%
And this is our almond
milk right here.

01:05:00.424 --> 01:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
You could blend a bunch of
almonds with spring water

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in a blender like
this over here.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring that on out.

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And you could just
do that at home.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Put some almonds in
there, spring water.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.562 align:middle line:90%
Blend it, and then strain it.

01:05:12.562 --> 01:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to do
it or you can put it

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:15.210 align:middle line:90%
through a cheesecloth.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just get
almond milk that's

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.800 align:middle line:90%
already prepared for you.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Many different ways
to go about this.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.590 align:middle line:90%
But we're--

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how you
make the almond milk?

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: --taking the upgrade.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.397 align:middle line:90%
Instead of going to cow milk--

01:05:25.397 --> 01:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.450 align:middle line:90%
This is non-dairy.

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We're
taking the upgrade.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just put
almonds in a blender

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.223 align:middle line:90%
with a little spring milk.

01:05:30.223 --> 01:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
You blend it up, and
then you strain out

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the meat of the almond
in order to get the milk.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:35.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's going to be our base.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:38.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's going to go in last.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
This is important
because, again,

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
if we make a
mistake here-- let's

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
say I was playing
around with cinnamon.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.371 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I threw
the whole bag of cinnamon

01:05:45.371 --> 01:05:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in there accidentally.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I can still fix it.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But once there's liquid in
there, I'm not fishing it out.

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing has
to be thrown away.

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's not such a
mistake with the cinnamon.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:52.870 align:middle line:90%
But this one?

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
That one's got an aroma to it.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Bacopa.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.360 align:middle line:90%
This thing's aromatic.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.901 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
there in a second.

01:05:56.901 --> 01:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Another part of this
whole brain boosting

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.665 align:middle line:84%
is making sure we have
stable blood sugar.

01:06:01.665 --> 01:06:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we put
mesquite in this drink.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's our first
ingredient is mesquite.

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And mesquite is one of
the most invasive trees

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.270 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world actually.

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's invasive
exactly where we

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
need it, which is the places
where we're having epidemics

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.175 align:middle line:84%
of diabetes and epidemics
of hypoglycemia.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: So, yeah.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.768 align:middle line:84%
So like in the state
of Arizona, mesquite

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely an
invasive species there.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was brought over
from the cattle from Texas.

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:27.489 align:middle line:90%
It was in their bodies.

01:06:27.489 --> 01:06:28.780 align:middle line:90%
The seeds were in their bodies.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought the
cattle over to Arizona

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and they took the
cattle off the trains

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and they started
walking around, what

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
came out the other
side is mesquite seeds.

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.392 align:middle line:84%
So now mesquite is
heavily prevalent in areas

01:06:39.392 --> 01:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
where there's diabetes
epidemic-- like Phoenix,

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Arizona.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why are there
diabetes epidemics

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.350 align:middle line:90%
in those specific regions?

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, that's
where people go to retire.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you reach
about 60, 65 years of age,

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
you start developing
diabetes syndromes.

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a syndrome.

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
diabetes type 2, obviously.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes type 2, it's a
mineral deficiency syndrome.

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a toxicity syndrome.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we
flip it around--

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's also a
syndrome of not eating

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.300 align:middle line:90%
enough fresh food and raw food.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
If you eat raw, fresh food, you
eat highly mineralized food.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And you take
enzymes, for example,

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and do things like this,
the symptoms just go away.

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is healing
from the inside out.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:20.034 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Absolutely.

01:07:20.034 --> 01:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The opposite
is taking something

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%
to fix that, which is important.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But this is the way to
start from the inside

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.044 align:middle line:84%
out-- the health coming
from the inside out.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I worked
with Dr. Cousens

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
out in the state of
Arizona for 13 years.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's the number one
diabetes doctor in the world.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.315 align:middle line:84%
He's actually healing
people of diabetes type 2.

01:07:37.315 --> 01:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Native American peoples--
all different types

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:40.689 align:middle line:84%
of folks in the
state of Arizona who

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.400 align:middle line:90%
have this epidemic of diabetes.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's a syndrome.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.782 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote an amazing
book on the subject.

01:07:45.782 --> 01:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's my education.

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So I don't come at it
as really a disease.

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I come at it as
more of a syndrome.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.474 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
how he's doing

01:07:51.474 --> 01:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it is through natural foods
and through various elixirs?

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Through raw foods
and supplements and enzymes.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:56.955 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
that in there just

01:07:56.955 --> 01:07:57.820 align:middle line:90%
to have stable blood sugar.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.900 align:middle line:90%
That is really important.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.102 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to stay clear
all day, if you're up and down,

01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're freaking
out, and you're

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.643 align:middle line:84%
going this way and that
way, and you're crashing--

01:08:05.643 --> 01:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
you can't keep your
head on straight.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We know that sugar is
actually a trigger.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
If we can't stabilize
our blood sugar

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and we have an elevated
blood sugar all of a sudden,

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:17.025 align:middle line:90%
that it can trigger mood swings.

01:08:17.025 --> 01:08:20.549 align:middle line:84%
It can trigger
schizophrenic and bipolar.

01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
All these things
are related to that.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So we want to just
[MAKES A SWISHING SOUND]

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:23.671 align:middle line:90%
keep it smooth.

01:08:23.671 --> 01:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So anyone knows if you
ever had that low blood sugar

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.609 align:middle line:84%
feeling and if you eat something
that's got sugar in it,

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
you're great for a little while.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
plummet right back down.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's right.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:31.959 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:31.959 --> 01:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So now we are going
to put honey in here

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:34.800 align:middle line:90%
because honey is a brain food.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But we put the
mesquite with the honey

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.390 align:middle line:90%
in order to neutralize it.

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:38.859 align:middle line:90%
To keep it smooth.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:42.819 align:middle line:84%
Now honey is one of the
great superfoods on Earth.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a
blood sugar disorder,

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
well, it's the summation
of your ecosystem.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph Steiner
said it this way.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:55.151 align:middle line:84%
Is that it mixes the atmosphere
with the water of your body.

01:08:55.151 --> 01:08:56.109 align:middle line:90%
Where does that happen?

01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
In your throat.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.269 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:58.200 align:middle line:90%
We're mostly water.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.464 align:middle line:90%
Where's the connection?

01:08:59.464 --> 01:09:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Like we're breathing in air.

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Where does it touch water?

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.149 align:middle line:90%
It's in our lungs.

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It's in our throat.

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.729 align:middle line:84%
That's where the dry
air meets our wet body.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And honey coats that, so
it helps to bridge that gap

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
and soothe your throat.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.962 align:middle line:84%
And he said it connects
the air with the water.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very interesting idea.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Now studies have been

It's highly improbable

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:50.399 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we've heard that.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:50.899 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to get used to
the local pollens,

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
then those bees will have
harvested them, right?

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:27.770 align:middle line:90%
So the local honey's good.

01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Absolutely.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing
is reishi mushroom,

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of my
favorites ever of all time.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fanatic about
reishi mushroom.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Reishi mushroom is the
most well-studied herb

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.774 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

01:10:41.774 --> 01:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I got a book that
was given to me.

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It was put together by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences,

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and it had well over
400 studies on reishi.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And it is a 330 page book.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Herb for--?

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Everything.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not only longevity.

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It's--

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:55.221 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Longevity.

01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Immunity.

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Joint protection.

01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Even blood sugar.

01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which actually
is all connected.

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's all connected.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:00.859 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:11:00.859 --> 01:11:03.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a pure tonic adaptogen.

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It adapts to whatever you
need and how you need it.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:07.134 align:middle line:84%
It's also a super
powerful brain food.

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
When I started doing this kind
of a thing-- now the reason

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
why I like it in
this form is this

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
is about the equivalent of
about 30 capsules opened up.

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.019 align:middle line:84%
You go to a health food
store, you buy reishi mushroom

01:11:16.019 --> 01:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
in capsules-- you're going to
have to go through a lot of 'em

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.162 align:middle line:84%
to get the effect
we're looking for.

01:11:20.162 --> 01:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why we got into
this idea of just,

01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
let's just get
people the powder so

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
they can do as
much as they want.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They can feed their kids
as much as they want.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you don't have
to take 30 pills a day.

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:28.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

01:11:28.175 --> 01:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Or open them all up if
you don't want to do that.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, reishi is a tremendous
brain food, and you feel it.

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
When you do a dose like this,
you feel it in your brain.

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:40.919 align:middle line:84%
And I started going like, I'm
feeling like high or something.

01:11:40.919 --> 01:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is this?

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
in the beginning

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know the research.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:45.136 align:middle line:90%
'Cause the research is vast.

01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It's thousands of
years of research.

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of
thousands of studies.

01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I started feeling
like something's going on.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm feeling like
sharp, clear, on it.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.934 align:middle line:84%
I remember back
in the early days

01:11:55.934 --> 01:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
when my computer used
to be in my house.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I would be like-- just
everything would be clear.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what is it?

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Something different
that I'm doing now

01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't doing before.

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So then I locked on to reishi.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.687 align:middle line:84%
Then I started talking to
experts on reishi mushroom,

01:12:08.687 --> 01:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
like Ron Teeguarden.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, oh, yeah.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.075 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, woah.

01:12:12.075 --> 01:12:13.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this needs to be known.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.289 align:middle line:90%
This has got to be known.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The studies show that
it increases blood circulation?

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
What do the studies show?

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well it
does everything.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you
have gluey blood.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It's agglutinated, which means
it's like thick and soupy.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Reishi mushroom will
thin your blood out.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great blood
thinner, actually.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.090 align:middle line:90%
It has that property.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It also has many
other properties.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
high blood pressure.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:39.017 align:middle line:84%
Reishi mushrooms,
top herb in the world

01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
for bringing down
high blood pressure.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting
because mushroom is also known

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
as a fungus, but this
type of thing takes the--

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is the
queen of the mushrooms.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.670 align:middle line:90%
The queen of all mushrooms.

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So lumping all
fungi, like candida,

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
into the category
of reishi is kind

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
of like lumping a human in with
the same category as a rat.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is the best
thing, actually,

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have candida or any
kind of blood sugar disorder

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
like that where your body
is reacting to the sugar

01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:10.110 align:middle line:90%
or you have thrush that occurs.

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the best thing
actually, reishi mushroom.

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:14.387 align:middle line:84%
And I first heard about
that from Andrew Weil.

01:13:14.387 --> 01:13:15.803 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Weil was
saying that, and I

01:13:15.803 --> 01:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
was like, this guy's
really onto mushrooms.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.211 align:middle line:84%
And then I later became even
more into mushrooms than he is.

01:13:21.211 --> 01:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now we know why.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:22.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:22.490 --> 01:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: There we go.

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:24.429 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's in there?

01:13:24.429 --> 01:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Big tablespoon--
heaping tablespoon--

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:27.690 align:middle line:90%
of reishi mushroom is in there.

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Next on the list is one
of the great super kind

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
of herbs that grows
in my front yard.

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And it grows all through India.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And it grows through
all the tropics.

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And on our farm in Hawaii,
we have this as a weed.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all around.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a super
brain tonic, and it

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.996 align:middle line:84%
is for the reason
you've been kind

01:13:42.996 --> 01:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of wanting me to get to--
increases brain circulation.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's gachu
kola or gotu kola.

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gotu kola?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of this before.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.875 align:middle line:90%
So that's gotu kola as a powder.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
If you buy super green
foods in a store--

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, people buy whatever
green thing is on the store,

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.206 align:middle line:90%
even though it tastes awful.

01:13:58.206 --> 01:13:59.464 align:middle line:90%
We know it's good for us.

01:13:59.464 --> 01:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be definitely one

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.338 align:middle line:84%
of the ingredients
that's in there.

01:14:02.338 --> 01:14:03.671 align:middle line:90%
It's in all of those formulas.

01:14:03.671 --> 01:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's in the green
food bars or those types?

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a brain tonic.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.448 align:middle line:84%
We used to have it
delivered to my house,

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:14.660 align:middle line:90%
fresh like wheatgrass, in trays.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And we'd juice it.

01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does it look
like in its raw form?

01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It has almost like
a semi-circular leaf, kind

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.320 align:middle line:90%
of like that.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And the stem comes from just
off-center from the middle.

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
mallows, if you're

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
familiar with those
plants, or marshmallow.

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Those are very common
in Southern California.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
common weeds around.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And gachu kola looks
just like that.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It has a circular leaf,
semi-circular to some degree.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you grow
this where you live in--

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.335 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's a weed there.

01:14:45.335 --> 01:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's indigenous to--

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's
indigenous to Hawaii.

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It's all over Hawaii.

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It's all over India.

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.984 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the tropics,
anywhere in the world.

01:14:50.984 --> 01:14:51.900 align:middle line:90%
You'll see it growing.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Now what if you were to eat the
leaf of something like that?

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you not want to do that?

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.091 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's geat.

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:56.810 align:middle line:90%
No, it's awesome.

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most of the
nutrient's in the stem.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: No, it's in the leaf.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's in the leaf?

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.943 align:middle line:84%
And you can eat it,
just like a salad green.

01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm at home in
Hawaii, I'm eating that.

That's one of my salad greens.

Yeah.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm out there picking
it as a salad green.

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And I try to get three in a day.

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Like if I'm out in the garden,
I have certain things--

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:14.942 align:middle line:90%
like tulsi.

01:15:14.942 --> 01:15:17.342 align:middle line:84%
I try to eat a tulsi
leaf every day.

01:15:17.342 --> 01:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Things that are in
my garden, I try

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
to just make sure I
get that in every day.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.753 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The tulsi and what else?

01:15:21.753 --> 01:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And gotu
kola is one of 'em.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.885 align:middle line:84%
Also I have these charapita
peppers that grow.

01:15:25.885 --> 01:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I try to do one
of those every day.

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like a habanero but
really, really small.

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's certain
things in my yard

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.980 align:middle line:90%
that I do just to kind of like--

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So those are
all circulation--

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:36.565 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Driven

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:37.265 align:middle line:90%

01:15:37.265 --> 01:15:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Exactly.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:37.992 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:39.320 align:middle line:90%

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's also a brain tonic.

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of the

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
It's eighth most

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's purslane.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
In India, they have targeted
it to a particular one,

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
which they call brome.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a particular
variety of purslane.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is it as a powder,
sometimes called bacopa.

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bacopa?

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Powder?

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: As a powder.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a brain tonic.

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's for people who have
neurological problems.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.237 align:middle line:84%
It's really one of the
great herbs of the world.

01:16:11.237 --> 01:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Now in the powder, it
doesn't taste good as fresh.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.647 align:middle line:90%


01:16:15.647 --> 01:16:16.230 align:middle line:90%

>>WOLFE: It's a succulent.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
You've seen it before.

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the eighth most

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a little succulent that

>>LISA: Gosh, yeah.

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.696 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able

>>WOLFE: It contains
EPA, by the way,

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.602 align:middle line:90%
which is what's in fish oil.

>>LISA: In a plant.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.393 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Now if you're
using bacopa at home,

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:40.390 align:middle line:90%
use a small amount.

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a quarter of a
teaspoon we just used.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.278 align:middle line:84%
That might even be too
much, because this stuff

is really rough.

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Mixed in with everything,
it's going to be fine.

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rough, meaning potent?

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's potent.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And you taste it, and you're
like, woah, woah, woah,

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But if you're accustomed

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.320 align:middle line:90%
it's fine.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.454 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

01:16:55.454 --> 01:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tastes like most

01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:57.805 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I'm used to
eating Chinese herbs that

01:16:57.805 --> 01:16:59.909 align:middle line:84%

01:16:59.909 --> 01:17:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: David goes.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%

01:17:03.803 --> 01:17:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean if you're there, great.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: OK.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:09.510 align:middle line:90%
So what do you think's next?

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:10.563 align:middle line:90%
Looks like cinnamon over there.

01:17:10.563 --> 01:17:10.783 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cinnamon.

01:17:10.783 --> 01:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Ah, good.

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.576 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:17:11.576 --> 01:17:12.577 align:middle line:90%
You want to do that one?

01:17:12.577 --> 01:17:13.076 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm.

01:17:13.076 --> 01:17:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Cinnamon-- blood
sugar stability.

01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:16.730 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're doing the
mesquite and the cinnamon

01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:21.860 align:middle line:84%
at the top and the bottom
to just keep us in that zone

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.200 align:middle line:90%
so we can be clear.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
'Cause when our blood
sugar is stable,

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually
think clearly.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
If it's up and down and
backwards and forwards,

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.670 align:middle line:90%
we can't.

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, I
need this, obviously,

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
because I've forgotten this.

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
We have mesquite.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yep.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Honey.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Need the brain.

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This was
reishi mushroom.

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:38.014 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Reishi.

>>WOLFE: Gotu kola.

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:40.549 align:middle line:90%
Bacopa.

01:17:40.549 --> 01:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And then we had cinnamon.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:42.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Mix it with almond milk.

01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:47.009 align:middle line:84%
I think you need this drink to
remember what's in the drink.

01:17:47.009 --> 01:17:48.217 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do. [LAUGHS]

01:17:48.217 --> 01:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So here
goes the almond milk.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:17:50.725 --> 01:17:51.225 align:middle line:90%
Woah.

01:17:51.225 --> 01:17:52.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Making enough for everyone.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: If you wanted to,
and I do this at home a lot,

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I would even add maybe half
as much again of a tea.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I had my gynostemma
tea or one of my favorite teas

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
over here.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I could just grab
that, pour it in here

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and then actually create kind
of like a hot, milky kind

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of a drink.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So right now, this
could be a cold drink.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
What if you were to put
something like ice in this?

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Would it--

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That'd be fine.

>>WOLFE: Nope.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:16.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or hot?

01:18:16.845 --> 01:18:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK as well?

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I like
going in the winter,

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I like adding like an
almond milk to a hot tea.

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes 50-50, and
then the herbs go in.

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And see, there's no calories
in any of those herbs.

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm glad
you mentioned that.

01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
So right.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So we have a
little bit of calories

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
with the almond milk.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
bit with the honey.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.270 align:middle line:90%
But that's really all we need.

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
hamburger-level
calories all day long.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or giant
smoothies or shakes.

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Right.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Which are high in calories.

01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.622 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:18:43.622 --> 01:18:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Pretty high in calories.

01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is very
low in calories as

01:18:45.525 --> 01:18:47.120 align:middle line:84%
compared to a
smoothie, for example.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: But is this as filling?

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Because the herbs fill it out.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.689 align:middle line:90%
Especially mesquite.

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
another thing-- that's

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.021 align:middle line:84%
kind of a secret reason
why I use mesquite.

01:18:56.021 --> 01:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Because it's filling.

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
is it-- by filling

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:00.737 align:middle line:90%
you mean it nourishes the cell.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: No, no, no.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean like it gets in your gut.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
And you go, oh, OK.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.235 align:middle line:90%
I'm full.

01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:05.957 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:19:05.957 --> 01:19:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.320 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:07.900 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am.

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I get to use my power tools.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Let's pop
the top on there.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, first.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Well, up there or here.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.270 align:middle line:90%
This is my favorite part.

01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.356 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.068 align:middle line:90%
So now, all the way up.

01:19:18.068 --> 01:19:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yep.

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm not going to talk.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.127 align:middle line:90%


01:19:22.127 --> 01:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Now we can
even go into hyperdrive.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.477 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:19:24.477 --> 01:19:26.435 align:middle line:84%
[SOUND OF A CLICK AND BLENDER
 SPEED INCREASES]

01:19:26.435 --> 01:19:27.185 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:32.870 align:middle line:90%


01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Done?

01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.016 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: This is going
to be really good.

01:19:38.016 --> 01:19:38.188 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

01:19:38.188 --> 01:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did that.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:39.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.859 align:middle line:84%
So I could drive the
guys in the booth crazy,

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and I could talk
during that segment.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.027 align:middle line:90%
I could go like this.

01:19:46.027 --> 01:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's hard to hear
over that blender, iIsn't it?

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.189 align:middle line:90%
OK now.

01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a go.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.684 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:50.684 --> 01:19:51.433 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:19:51.433 --> 01:19:55.689 align:middle line:90%


01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That looks-- actually
it's beautiful.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's going
to be so good.

01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, it
looks like something--

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:03.634 align:middle line:84%
so this could be a
combination of a-- cheers!

01:20:03.634 --> 01:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Cheers!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To your health!

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:05.085 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: All right.

01:20:05.085 --> 01:20:07.418 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if our brain's gonna
work after we drink this.

01:20:07.418 --> 01:20:10.272 align:middle line:90%


01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I should have prepared
the Gettysburg Address

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.650 align:middle line:90%
so that I could recite it.

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's good, isn't it?

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is--

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's really good, yes.

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
That's really good.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Oh, man.

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We can't talk
because it's just so good.

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: We need to
keep the cameras going

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
so that the people behind the
cameras can't come in here

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
and have any of this smoothie.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is really good.

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So to boost your
brain power-- and who

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need a little
more of that in a world

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
where it gets a little
bit busy out there?

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.040 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
This is such a great alternative
to a lot of the things that

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
are out there, and you
see how easy it is.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And these herbs are
very accessible.

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: It's kind of
the same but different.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the same idea
that we've done before.

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:46.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:46.880 align:middle line:90%
We're using a blender.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got various
different powders.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But instead of it being some
super weight gain or whey

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
protein, flex-o-fuel--
whatever that stuff is--

01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That has an ingredients
list this thick, yeah.

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.878 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And major
chemicals in it.

01:20:56.878 --> 01:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This is just all herbs
and food, and it's

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
driving us towards
the result that we

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
want-- which is
better brain health.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:02.761 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:21:02.761 --> 01:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of history
behind all of this as well.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.340 align:middle line:90%
So cheers to best day ever.
