00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.486 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.287 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.622 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.524 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live
from Boulder, Colorado,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.526 align:middle line:84%
here at the Gaiam
Studios in Boulder.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.729 align:middle line:84%
And we encourage you
to interact with us

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.163 align:middle line:90%
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.499 align:middle line:84%
Since this is a live show,
please connect with us.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.301 align:middle line:84%
Many of you already
have started that chat,

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.403 align:middle line:84%
so keep the questions
coming so we'll

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.739 align:middle line:84%
get to them later
on in the show.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.475 align:middle line:84%
So, today we're talking
about space and time,

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.078 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to live
in a holographic universe.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.813 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about all of this

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.416 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of quantum physics

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:84%
so that we can find out how
to take charge of our lives

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.487 align:middle line:90%
at the quantum level.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.522 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Fred Allan Wolfe.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.423 align:middle line:90%
He's a physicist.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.326 align:middle line:84%
And he's got 14 books
on quantum physics.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.862 align:middle line:84%
One of them is called "Time
Loops and Space Twists."

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.765 align:middle line:84%
He's also known
affectionately as Dr. Quantum.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:84%
He has a really wonderful way of
taking these abstract concepts

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.604 align:middle line:84%
and simplifying them so
that we can apply them

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:11.605 align:middle line:90%
to our own lives.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.806 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.741 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED ALLAN WOLFE: Thank
you very much, Lisa.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.876 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As you can see,
Dr. Quantum's a lot of fun.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.146 align:middle line:90%
So this really helps--

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:19.379 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: I hope so.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.849 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --helps us understand
quantum physics, a very complex

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.483 align:middle line:90%
topic.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.354 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk a little bit
about how time is an illusion.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.823 align:middle line:84%
That's really the basis of
what we're talking about today.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.125 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Actually, what we're
really talking about today

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.163 align:middle line:84%
is how you can become an
artist in your own life

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.065 align:middle line:90%
and create your universe.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:39.265 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Create your universe.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.735 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: How to be an artist
creating your universe.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:45.104 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the real
trick to understanding

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.807 align:middle line:84%
the nature of time,
space, matter,

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.675 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff is
really understanding

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:90%
who you really are.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.646 align:middle line:84%
And most of us don't
know who we really are.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.149 align:middle line:90%
We think we are something else.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.685 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And so,
what is the answer?

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.821 align:middle line:84%
How do I become an artist
creating the universe?

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:05.192 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
learning to identify

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.695 align:middle line:84%
with the dreaming
creator that you are.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.632 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that sounds--

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:16.303 align:middle line:84%
that sounds like science fiction
to me, Dr. Quantum, whatever.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:17.337 align:middle line:90%
How do I do that?

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.206 align:middle line:90%
How do I go about doing that?

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.209 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to look for
some ancient teachings

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to get some of this wisdom.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.378 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That'll help us.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That might help us.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.416 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ancient teachers
who first brought this out

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:84%
to us all was somebody
that lived almost 2,600,

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:38.191 align:middle line:84%
2,700 years ago he was
called Gautama, the Buddha.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:44.197 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the
trick, guys, bikinibu--

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.531 align:middle line:90%
what'd he called his-- bhikkhus.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.035 align:middle line:90%
Bhikkus.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:51.271 align:middle line:84%
Priests, guys that are studying
under me, sitting at my feet.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.072 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disciples.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.607 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: The trick--
disciples, right.

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:57.344 align:middle line:84%
He says to know all things to
be like this, that what you're

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
seeing before you is a mirage,
a cloud floating in the air.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.419 align:middle line:90%
It's a phantom.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.856 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing really
real that you can really

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.825 align:middle line:90%
put your feet on.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.061 align:middle line:90%
It has no essence.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:18.698 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing solid
that can be seen.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Know all things to be like
this, as the moon reflected

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.008 align:middle line:84%
in a bright night
on a still stream.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.011 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he was explaining
quantum physics way back then.

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.746 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: He was
explaining the basis

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:38.051 align:middle line:84%
of how one identifies
with the big dreamer

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.656 align:middle line:84%
by understanding that all things
are really dreamlike rather

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.859 align:middle line:90%
than solid reality.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.594 align:middle line:84%
He says know all
things to be like this,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:51.698 align:middle line:84%
to be something really
special, like an echo.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:84%
You hear an echo
reverberating in your ear,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.337 align:middle line:90%
but it's nothing spoken.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.139 align:middle line:90%
So this is the big trick.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.776 align:middle line:84%
As a magician might create
illusions of various things,

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.846 align:middle line:84%
think of yourself
as the magician

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.747 align:middle line:90%
creating the illusions.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.717 align:middle line:84%
You may be amazed at the
illusions you create.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.152 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so this
is how we start

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:13.987 align:middle line:90%
to create our own universe.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: This is how we
create our own reality.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Buddha's referring to.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.428 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
you've got to refer to

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:26.233 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that
everything is not as it seems.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.203 align:middle line:84%
Now, physicists
didn't quite catch on

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.105 align:middle line:84%
with this at the
time of the Buddha.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Because there weren't
any physicists.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.474 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At the time.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.509 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: --anyway.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.845 align:middle line:84%
In fact, around 1920 there
wasn't even maybe 300 of them

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:41.181 align:middle line:90%
all in the whole earth.

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.885 align:middle line:84%
So, by the time of
Werner Heisenberg, who

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.088 align:middle line:84%
was a father of what's called
the uncertainty principle,

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.756 align:middle line:90%
we begin to catch on.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:55.328 align:middle line:84%
And Heisenberg recognized that
what the physics was telling

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:59.132 align:middle line:84%
him-- which is the birth
of quantum physics--

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:03.837 align:middle line:84%
is that things are not as solid
as they appear, that there's

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:08.608 align:middle line:84%
another realm of existence, what
he calls a middle realm, that's

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:14.948 align:middle line:84%
between the conscious
mind and waking awareness

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:20.387 align:middle line:84%
and something else,
something that's

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:24.591 align:middle line:84%
between that conscious mind
and the so-called out there

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:26.393 align:middle line:90%
world of physicality.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's something
between what we want--

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:28.962 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Something between--

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and what is.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.463 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yeah.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.465 align:middle line:84%
Something between
the material world

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.935 align:middle line:90%
and the mind, which is created.

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:84%
There is a middle
realm, something else,

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
a dreaming realm you might call.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.243 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I called it
the dreaming universe.

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.778 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
where we create.

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get--
that's where the juice is.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.049 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: This is where
creation comes from.

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.219 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's space
between the reality

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and what we're creating.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.154 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Exactly.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And the elements of the
dream, the things that

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.293 align:middle line:84%
come into this imaginal
realm of the dream world,

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:04.097 align:middle line:84%
are the things that you've
worked with in new ways.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:07.367 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Freud was the first
to point out, there you are.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.436 align:middle line:84%
And you are in bed
with your mother.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.671 align:middle line:90%
But she's only 20 years old.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.106 align:middle line:90%
How could I be doing that?

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.942 align:middle line:84%
And all the kind
of weird Freudian

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.143 align:middle line:90%
stuff that came out of there.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.812 align:middle line:84%
But Freud was
pointing to something

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.616 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of dreams,
that time and space and matter

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.551 align:middle line:90%
don't have the same meanings.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.486 align:middle line:84%
That thoughts and
feelings and sensations

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.687 align:middle line:90%
don't have the same meanings.

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.924 align:middle line:84%
But time, space, matter,
thoughts, and feelings

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:34.394 align:middle line:84%
arise from this middle
realm, this invisible realm--

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.428 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From this realm--

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.296 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Of existance.

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.666 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --where we are often the
observer of that realm, right?

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.734 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Exactly.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.334 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.504 align:middle line:84%
And we are observing in that
realm, although most of us--

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:46.506 align:middle line:84%
many of us, for example,
sleep and we don't even

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.874 align:middle line:90%
remember our dreams.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.175 align:middle line:90%
But some people do.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.378 align:middle line:84%
And some people wake
up in the dream.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.313 align:middle line:90%
We call that lucid dreaming.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:56.916 align:middle line:84%
And we have an experience
of the creative power

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.053 align:middle line:84%
in lucid dreaming-- if
you begin to practice

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:01.554 align:middle line:90%
that kind of a thing.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.056 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that's the whole idea.

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:90%
There's a story going on.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:07.394 align:middle line:84%
There's a story,
and your story is

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
made from this invisible realm.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:84%
You're putting together
the ideas of a story

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:18.238 align:middle line:84%
like braids that are being
twisted into storylines

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:21.841 align:middle line:84%
of histories and stuff
that happened to you.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:25.745 align:middle line:84%
But the whole idea,
remember, is to identify

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:29.249 align:middle line:84%
with the dreamer rather
than the dreamed.

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:31.618 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone is asking--
one of our Facebook listeners

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.721 align:middle line:84%
is asking-- Caroline-- when you
reference the observer in all

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:36.056 align:middle line:90%
of us, do you mean awareness?

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.457 align:middle line:90%
Do you--

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Awareness is
something an observer does.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:44.931 align:middle line:84%
But the observer is
even beyond awareness.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.702 align:middle line:84%
The observer is something you
might call the super awareness

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.203 align:middle line:90%
if you want to give it a name.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Or the mind of God if you want
to give it that kind of a name.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.242 align:middle line:90%
It's awareness beyond awareness.

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.977 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a
universal awareness?

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It's something we call
the universal awareness, mind

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:02.349 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.683 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Universal consciousness?

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:06.286 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Universal consciousness.

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:10.924 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you name it,
you sort of limit it.

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:13.993 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the right
limits to apply to it yet.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.764 align:middle line:84%
So we can call it whatever
you wish at this point.

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:18.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:18.765 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.633 align:middle line:84%
Holographic universe, as
we were talking about.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.735 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well that
we can get into.

00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:23.136 align:middle line:84%
Holographic universe,
I mean, what

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.738 align:middle line:90%
the heck is going on there?

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a larger
sense, in physics we

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.643 align:middle line:84%
have found out that
quantum physics--

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
when you try to
put quantum physics

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:36.182 align:middle line:84%
and Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.953 align:middle line:84%
which was the attempt to bring
gravity into space and time,

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.155 align:middle line:84%
when you try to
put those together

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:44.958 align:middle line:84%
it's so hard to do
that nobody really

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
has figured out a way
to do it consistently.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.028 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like it eludes us.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.563 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To take
quantum physics and--

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.599 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And general
theory of relativity.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --together.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.201 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Put gravity and
quantum physics together.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.336 align:middle line:90%
You can't seem to do it.

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.138 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because one's
abstract and one's--

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.672 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: One is
big and out there.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:08:59.939 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Concrete.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.941 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And the other's small
and in here, so to speak.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.176 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very hard to do.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:06.446 align:middle line:84%
But physicists aren't
tired of giving up.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're not
tired of going on.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.349 align:middle line:90%
They don't give up.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:10.583 align:middle line:90%
They keep going on with this.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.852 align:middle line:84%
And they figured
out a new idea that

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.155 align:middle line:84%
came when they
studied black holes.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.524 align:middle line:84%
They figured out-- a
black hole, by the way,

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:21.961 align:middle line:84%
is when you have a
gravitationally collapsed star

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.165 align:middle line:84%
that has so much mass that
it forms something called

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:28.001 align:middle line:84%
a black hole, where space and
time around the black hole

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:30.336 align:middle line:84%
get twisted in a
weird kind of way.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:36.443 align:middle line:84%
And something called a horizon--
spherical horizon-- forms

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.678 align:middle line:90%
around the collapsed matter.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:42.148 align:middle line:84%
And on that horizon, space
and time get very weird.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.284 align:middle line:84%
And Stephen Hawking,
a physicist,

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:48.988 align:middle line:84%
said you know, black
holes don't seem-- I mean,

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:51.724 align:middle line:84%
if you throw something into a
black hole, it just disappears.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.426 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum
physics, we're always

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.728 align:middle line:84%
worried about
things disappearing.

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:58.231 align:middle line:84%
If they disappear, I
want them to come back.

00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:59.265 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.734 align:middle line:84%
Because we've become
attached to reality.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.003 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: We don't
want things-- what

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.572 align:middle line:90%
happens to the information?

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:08.107 align:middle line:90%
Where does the information go?

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.478 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics don't
want to give up information.

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:14.347 align:middle line:84%
And so, a physicist,
Jacob Bekenstein,

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:17.517 align:middle line:84%
figured out that
the information gets

00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:20.186 align:middle line:84%
stored on the surfaces
of black holes.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.287 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Around that sphere?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:21.788 align:middle line:90%
Around--

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.623 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Around this
collapsing stars.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.991 align:middle line:90%
And that got very weird.

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.728 align:middle line:84%
Because if that's
true, then one could

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:32.632 align:middle line:84%
map, from the information stored
on the black hole, everything

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:84%
that was outside of
it that fell into it.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:38.705 align:middle line:84%
So, suddenly it became
possible-- physicists thought--

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:44.711 align:middle line:84%
maybe everything in the universe
is on the surface of something.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.379 align:middle line:90%
Does it have to be a black hole?

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.281 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
turned out to be it

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.083 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be a black hole.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:53.686 align:middle line:84%
It can be any surface, anywhere,
where information could be

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:57.724 align:middle line:84%
stored in such a way
that projected from that

00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:01.794 align:middle line:84%
information-- just like a movie
is projected from a camera--

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:04.631 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So could also
happen within our own minds.

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.499 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Not only our
own minds, but the thing

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.801 align:middle line:84%
we're in right now, this
space we're in right now

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:90%
is also being projected.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.772 align:middle line:84%
Even the third
dimension is being

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
projected from this surface.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.077 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we ourselves
are being projected

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:22.315 align:middle line:84%
from the surfaces
of something that's

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:29.756 align:middle line:84%
where at infinity both forward
in time and backward in time

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:90%
at the time of the Big Bang.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.358 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And now we're back--

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.961 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: In other words,
we are in the mind of God.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.497 align:middle line:84%
And we're having this
illusion of being

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:40.133 align:middle line:84%
little itty tiny people doing
our things, bah, bah, bah, bah.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.001 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, right now,
we're in the studio.

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.905 align:middle line:84%
And right now we're trying to
bring it back here to reality.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.106 align:middle line:90%
We're right here on this day.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.441 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Reality, what a concept.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.776 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's really--

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There isn't reality
in your world, is there?

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:52.979 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: There is.

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:56.182 align:middle line:84%
There is, but as
I say, the trick

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:58.851 align:middle line:84%
is identifying with the
dreamer, identifying

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.887 align:middle line:84%
with the guy who's running
the projection show.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is us,
which is essentially us.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.124 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's the clue.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.827 align:middle line:84%
That's the clue, that we're
also running the projector.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:11.664 align:middle line:84%
And that's where fun can be
had and something more exciting

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:12.398 align:middle line:90%
can take place.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's a lot of
fun to hang out with.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.469 align:middle line:84%
All right, so
basically, what you

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:20.807 align:middle line:84%
perceive life as, and
everything in life, is light.

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:22.875 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about that?

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:28.548 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, the trick is that
when people began to experiment

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:32.251 align:middle line:84%
with this idea that everything's
on surfaces, this got a name.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It was called
holographic principle,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.623 align:middle line:84%
in which they figured out that
all the stuff that's going on

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:38.491 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, all the
quarks and the things

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:41.494 align:middle line:84%
banging around and so forth,
that the projections of those

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:45.898 align:middle line:84%
into something called space,
third dimension of space,

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:49.802 align:middle line:84%
the world we live in, turned
out to bring out gravity.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:53.506 align:middle line:84%
Gravity suddenly emerged
along with that space.

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:56.009 align:middle line:90%
So suddenly, gravity appeared.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:56.843 align:middle line:90%
Drop an apple.

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:90%
Now we know why it's dropping.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:01.347 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's emerging
from this two dimensional

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.549 align:middle line:90%
surface of stuff.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:08.021 align:middle line:84%
And so, the idea was, well,
what's making these surfaces?

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have the idea that
what is making these surfaces

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.193 align:middle line:84%
is something called
a sheet of light.

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:18.197 align:middle line:84%
So what we have,
really, is a light sheet

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:22.468 align:middle line:84%
which starts out from,
maybe, the beginning of time,

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
ending at the ending of time.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.139 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be something
which starts out

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
a moment and ending

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.009 align:middle line:90%
at the ending of a moment.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:32.578 align:middle line:84%
And all the information
that's needed

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:37.383 align:middle line:84%
to make a room
appear, with us in it,

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
are coming from light
sheets that we are emitting

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.956 align:middle line:84%
to some final point, and light
sheets which are coming in--

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:44.757 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coming in--

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: --from--

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:45.858 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --other points.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:46.526 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Other points.

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So right now--

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.294 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yeah, right now.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.962 align:middle line:84%
And the way we think
about that is we're

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:84%
sending out light sheets both
backwards and forwards in time.

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:53.766 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.935 align:middle line:84%
So, right now, this is
what's creating our universe,

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:56.836 align:middle line:90%
is these lights.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's right.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The waves lights--

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.073 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: The projections are from
light sheets from the beginning

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and the ending of time.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.142 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you really
were to look at a room,

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:06.679 align:middle line:84%
it would be filled
with matter of light.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:12.585 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: With light sheets
forming gravity, matter,

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:13.286 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.154 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
forming is being

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.657 align:middle line:84%
formed by projections
from light sheets.

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:18.157 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So--

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:19.726 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Just like
a real holograph.

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:22.562 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you look at a
hologram, and you look at it--

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:22.762 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dimensions--

00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And you look
through it, the hologram

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.399 align:middle line:84%
itself is a flat
sheet of something.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.834 align:middle line:90%
And it's got waviness on it.

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.168 align:middle line:90%
You don't see any picture there.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.771 align:middle line:84%
Shine a laser light through
it, and suddenly there--

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:32.171 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There it is.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.439 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: There's a three
dimensional object

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:90%
right out there.

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, just carry that out a
couple more steps further.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.113 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you see an image
of a three dimensional object,

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.681 align:middle line:84%
there is a three
dimensional object.

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.548 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A three
dimensional object.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.915 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Because you can
feel and hold in your hand.

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:44.884 align:middle line:90%
And it has weight.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:44.984 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.552 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And you can drop it and
it falls like an apple, too.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.087 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
just basically light

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:90%
slowed down into dense reality.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.424 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Well, it's--

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:54.794 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, well--

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:55.294 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: hard to explain
what it actually

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:58.297 align:middle line:84%
is, but, like a hologram,
what is that image that's

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.198 align:middle line:90%
floating out in space?

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.634 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- I mean,
we see it there.

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:02.902 align:middle line:90%
But is it really there?

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.238 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an illusion that
it's really there, right?

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:06.439 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It's an
illusion, that's right.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.342 align:middle line:90%
So is the apple really there?

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:11.911 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really there,
but is it really there?

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.381 align:middle line:84%
Or is it an illusion of
weight and matter and energy

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.016 align:middle line:84%
that's being projected
holographically?

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.118 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, I look at this
from the perspective of

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:21.187 align:middle line:84%
is your chaos really there,
or is it an illusion?

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.656 align:middle line:84%
Is your stress really
there, or is it an illusion?

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.192 align:middle line:84%
Is your negativity really
there, or is it an illusion?

00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It's really
all illusion,

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.096 align:middle line:90%
but we give importance to it.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we learn--
that's when we stop identifying

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.635 align:middle line:84%
with the creator, when we
start giving importance

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to the illusion
rather than to what

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.739 align:middle line:84%
may be really
important in our lives.

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And one of
our listeners was

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.009 align:middle line:84%
asking if this field--
Drake was asking

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:46.045 align:middle line:84%
is the field that we're
in what connects us all?

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.814 align:middle line:84%
Is that holographic
field that we're

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:49.782 align:middle line:84%
in-- how does quantum
physics explain

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:54.187 align:middle line:90%
how or why we are all connected?

00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.422 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, we're not
really all connected.

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.624 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:02.028 align:middle line:84%
The thing which is happening
is how do we get all separated?

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:04.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did I mention we're on
for a wild ride here, today?

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:08.067 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: You see, connection
implies separate to begin with,

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.402 align:middle line:90%
and then you connect.

00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:12.939 align:middle line:84%
But what if you're one to begin
with and then you separate?

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:15.341 align:middle line:84%
So it's really more
how do we get separate?

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.877 align:middle line:84%
And the thing which
separates us, of course,

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:84%
is part of this
illusion of there

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.315 align:middle line:84%
being separate hunks of
matter, and identifying

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.084 align:middle line:84%
with separate hunks of matter,
including separate bodies.

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that process
of identification,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.592 align:middle line:84%
we cut the strands which
are always been there,

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:35.428 align:middle line:84%
but we don't pay
attention to them.

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:39.031 align:middle line:84%
And there we go,
going through life.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.167 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we get
sexually mature,

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.203 align:middle line:84%
and we get, oh my God, I
feel the urge to connect.

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:45.004 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:45.838 align:middle line:90%
That's what that is.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:46.038 align:middle line:90%
That's what that is.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:46.906 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's what that is.

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:49.342 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so we were
talking about sheets of light

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.344 align:middle line:84%
and how everything
is a sheet of light.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.512 align:middle line:90%
And then, how this connects us.

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.748 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, these
sheets of light

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:59.051 align:middle line:84%
contain the
information which make

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.754 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
appearance of reality.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:84%
So, these sheets
of light are really

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:07.393 align:middle line:84%
the projection screens out of
which the things that we call

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:10.229 align:middle line:84%
the real world come
into existence.

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.931 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that's all about.

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.733 align:middle line:84%
That's what the picture
is trying to tell us.

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
It's a little difficult
picture to understand,

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.338 align:middle line:84%
but that's basically
what it's telling us.

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So, OK.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.575 align:middle line:84%
So, explain to us what
this all means to us today,

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:25.243 align:middle line:84%
how we are living in a
holographic illusion.

00:17:25.243 --> 00:17:32.685 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, the whole idea is
that you, right now, at home,

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:38.357 align:middle line:84%
exist in the mind of God at
infinite beginning of time,

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.893 align:middle line:90%
at infinite ending of time.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.061 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.863 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And by God you
mean the universal--

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:45.164 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: I mean the mind of God.

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean whatever you
want a call that.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.038 align:middle line:84%
That intelligence field,
the big field in the sky.

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:53.506 align:middle line:84%
However you want
to talk about it.

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:55.741 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The human energy
field, the quantum field.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.276 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Give it any
name you want to.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.277 align:middle line:90%
It's more than human.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It could be any-- could be
all animal life gets it.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.682 align:middle line:90%
And all rocks get it.

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:03.916 align:middle line:90%
And everybody gets it.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.885 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big field--

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.553 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That Fred
calls the mind of God.

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:08.988 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: I call it
the mind of God.

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
it projects via light

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.831 align:middle line:84%
into whatever
space, time, matter,

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:23.569 align:middle line:84%
particulate of where you are
at any particular moment.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.505 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
it also provides you

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
with an identification procedure
in which you say I am here now.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.014 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:36.983 align:middle line:84%
So that's how--
that is basically

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:40.853 align:middle line:84%
how the entire field--
this holographic illusion--

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
from the observer, from us the
observer, says we are here now.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:50.429 align:middle line:84%
So can we, indeed, observe
our past differently?

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.864 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: We can
observe anything we

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:84%
want if we begin the
identification process that I

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:58.771 align:middle line:84%
mentioned to you, which is to
stop identifying with the here

00:18:58.771 --> 00:18:59.805 align:middle line:90%
and now.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:84%
Because the here
and now-- I mean,

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:04.643 align:middle line:84%
all the greats spiritual
teachers said be here now.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.412 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that's as much

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:08.948 align:middle line:84%
of a fantasy as
what you might think

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:10.216 align:middle line:90%
anything I'm saying right here.

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:11.484 align:middle line:90%
You can't be here, now.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:15.321 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
no here now to be.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.489 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good point.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:20.559 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: So, the whole point is
you're everywhere, at all time.

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:23.763 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real reality
of who and what you are.

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:84%
And so, being here,
now, focusing in,

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:30.436 align:middle line:84%
which is part of what
I teach in my books

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:32.972 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that's
part of the process.

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:36.409 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that it's
a process that you can learn,

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:39.111 align:middle line:84%
then you can begin to
identify with that which

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:84%
is making that process, rather
than identify with the process

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:43.616 align:middle line:90%
and be stuck in it.

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:46.085 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go back to
our Facebook questions.

00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:47.586 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
says, will this--

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
how will this lead us
into a sustainable future?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.293 align:middle line:84%
How will this whole
concept of quantum physics

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:90%
lead us to a sustainable future?

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:58.431 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, what does it mean
to be a sustainable future?

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:01.834 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to be sustainable?

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.169 align:middle line:90%
Having enough to eat?

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Having enough money to spend?

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.305 align:middle line:90%
Having enough clothes to wear?

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:07.773 align:middle line:90%
Having enough air to breathe?

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:08.374 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Enough.

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:08.874 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: OK.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:84%
If we can imagine those
things-- if we can imagine them,

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:16.515 align:middle line:84%
then we can imagine-- we can
allow our dreams to tell us

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:21.053 align:middle line:84%
what we need to do to
improve the situation,

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:26.225 align:middle line:84%
or make it better, or make
it more real for other people

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.793 align:middle line:90%
who are suffering.

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.228 align:middle line:84%
There's still lots
of people that

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.231 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough of
the things that we

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.033 align:middle line:84%
may want to have
more of, they don't

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.835 align:middle line:90%
have enough of to begin with.

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:38.304 align:middle line:84%
So we have to begin
to think globally

00:20:38.304 --> 00:20:39.772 align:middle line:90%
about the whole situation.

00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we really
can affect this

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:84%
with our collective
consciousness.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.477 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: We're doing
it all the time.

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:45.644 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it all the time.

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:49.915 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the mind is more than
just the individual mind.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:55.754 align:middle line:84%
And when events start to happen,
they happen everywhere at once.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't just happen in
one or two individuals that

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.427 align:middle line:84%
have this idea, but a lot of
people have the same idea.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:04.497 align:middle line:84%
Some people carry the idea
out, and they get known for it.

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:06.465 align:middle line:84%
But other people were
having the ideas, too.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.234 align:middle line:84%
They may decide it
was just a fantasy.

00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:09.435 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't want to do that.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.669 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever.

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:13.672 align:middle line:84%
But once an idea starts
to-- once the dreamer starts

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:17.776 align:middle line:84%
to dream, then the dream
begins to manifest.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then, how
can we, indeed, affect

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:21.313 align:middle line:90%
our future with this concept?

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:84%
How can we start to
project into the future

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:90%
with the concept of the dreamer?

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.787 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, that's
what the dreamer is.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
The dreamer is in
the future already.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.593 align:middle line:90%
So the dreamer is already there.

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:35.895 align:middle line:90%
And there are multiple dreams.

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:39.832 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
possible dreams of the future,

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:40.966 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.636 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to remember
you are the dreamer,

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.939 align:middle line:84%
and the future is
already where you're at.

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:49.875 align:middle line:84%
So, now you have
to figure out a way

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
to connect where you're at
to where you think you are,

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.748 align:middle line:84%
which is like in
the here and now.

00:21:55.748 --> 00:22:01.353 align:middle line:84%
So in some courses in
positive thinking or whatever,

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:04.857 align:middle line:84%
they tell you to realize
your goals by pretending

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:08.194 align:middle line:84%
you're already have really--
I want to be a millionaire,

00:22:08.194 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
well think of yourself as having
a million dollars right now.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.432 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the dreamer
in the future of you

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:16.035 align:middle line:84%
as a millionaire reaching back
to where you are right now.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:16.769 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:18.671 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back to
our Facebook questions.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:20.806 align:middle line:84%
And so, thank you very
much for bringing us--

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.409 align:middle line:84%
for communicating with us
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:25.678 align:middle line:84%
So do you believe that your
mind-- Judy from Facebook

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:28.147 align:middle line:84%
asks do you believe that
your mind is powerful enough

00:22:28.147 --> 00:22:29.315 align:middle line:90%
to heal the body?

00:22:29.315 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And is there any science
in quantum physics

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.553 align:middle line:90%
that actually proves that?

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:39.358 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: The body mind
has got mind in it.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:44.063 align:middle line:84%
So healing cannot take
place without mind.

00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:46.999 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see something
try to heal itself,

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:52.004 align:middle line:84%
watch a bar of iron
that has a nick in it.

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:52.771 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not--

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It'll rust over,
but it ain't going to heal,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.942 align:middle line:84%
because there's not much
mind stuff going on there.

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.911 align:middle line:90%
There's some, but not much.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:01.146 align:middle line:84%
But you cut your
finger and suddenly you

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:04.917 align:middle line:90%
see the body mind acting.

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:06.719 align:middle line:84%
You might be able
to even influence

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
with your conscious mind.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.122 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you may
actually influence or change

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.056 align:middle line:90%
the healing pattern.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.324 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so interesting.

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:14.893 align:middle line:84%
So we can, with our minds,
really affect our healing.

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.162 align:middle line:84%
We can also adversely
affect our disease.

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:17.663 align:middle line:90%
We can--

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:20.866 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: We can also
adversely affect our healing.

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:23.269 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
things that we can do--

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's-- yeah--

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:23.869 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: And with--

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:24.303 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
I meant by disease.

00:23:24.303 --> 00:23:24.803 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:27.506 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And it's a
question-- right now,

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:30.042 align:middle line:84%
how much do you want to pay
attention to in your body?

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:32.411 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to pay attention
to the health of my body.

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.979 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: OK, well,
what does that mean?

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:36.982 align:middle line:84%
For example, do you
want to pay attention

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:42.221 align:middle line:84%
to the blood which is moving
through your heart right now?

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to watch that?

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:45.224 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:23:45.224 --> 00:23:45.758 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yeah?

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:46.058 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:46.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why not?

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:47.826 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Well, yeah.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, suppose you have
negative thoughts, something

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.531 align:middle line:90%
that comes up.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.133 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- you want to be
able to stop your blood

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:54.867 align:middle line:90%
from flowing in your heart?

00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:55.134 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:55.634 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: No.

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:59.038 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain autonomic
functions of your body

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:00.939 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't want
to pay attention to.

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.707 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:02.574 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're saying.

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.576 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: You don't want
to mess around with that.

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:05.978 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:24:05.978 --> 00:24:07.146 align:middle line:90%
Yogis do it.

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:09.615 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be careful
when you start messing around

00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.217 align:middle line:84%
with things which are pretty
much doing what they're

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:14.153 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be doing
without you messing around

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:15.587 align:middle line:90%
with your conscious mind.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:19.024 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a certain
amount of let it be.

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:20.859 align:middle line:90%
Let it be.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:26.165 align:middle line:84%
It's got a million years
of genetic evolution

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.033 align:middle line:84%
which has given you
the ability to not

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:32.204 align:middle line:84%
have to think about that stuff,
so why you want to get into it?

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.973 align:middle line:84%
What do you expect to
gain from getting into it?

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.475 align:middle line:84%
That's the question
you have to ask.

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:39.011 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, and as
quantum physics also says,

00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:40.446 align:middle line:90%
let it be and let it go.

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:84%
Really, I never
really thought about

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:44.216 align:middle line:84%
that quantum physics
explains that--

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:44.717 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yes.

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:45.884 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in such clarity.

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.252 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain that
a little bit for us?

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:48.987 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, basically,
it's a question

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to learn
to do something which

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
is, I would say, not
letting it being, but more

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:00.366 align:middle line:84%
or less focusing on
how to make it better,

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:03.836 align:middle line:84%
creating it, and letting it
go, which means allowing more

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:07.539 align:middle line:84%
possibilities to enter so that
you can change what you have

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.574 align:middle line:90%
or what you're doing.

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:09.074 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:09.375 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:09.975 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:13.078 align:middle line:84%
So, God, great question from
our Facebook listener, Mark.

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:19.551 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think physics is
not taught in high school?

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.286 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It's what do
you think about how

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.488 align:middle line:84%
physics is taught
in high school?

00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:23.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, about how
physics is taught.

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:24.123 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: OK.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:90%
What do I think about that?

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:30.095 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends on the
high school teacher.

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:34.066 align:middle line:84%
Physics is very much
a very personal thing.

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:40.239 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher has a lot to do
with how the course is taught.

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:42.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone like you
who's dynamic and cares

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:45.577 align:middle line:84%
really can get the concepts
across in a colorful way

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:46.612 align:middle line:90%
would be helpful.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:48.147 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: That depends
on the students.

00:25:48.147 --> 00:25:48.714 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does?

00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:50.015 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yes, of course it does.

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:53.218 align:middle line:84%
Because students
who take physics

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:55.754 align:middle line:84%
can take physics for
various different reasons.

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:58.157 align:middle line:84%
One is it's required,
and I gotta take it,

00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:59.057 align:middle line:90%
but I don't like it.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, I
don't understand it.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:02.161 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: I don't
understand any of it.

00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:04.296 align:middle line:84%
What has it got to
do with my sex life?

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:06.365 align:middle line:84%
What is it got to do
with my making money?

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:08.901 align:middle line:84%
Who's got-- it has everything
to do with all those things.

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.334 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was about
to say, doesn't it?

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:09.668 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Everything to do
with all those things.

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:84%
But unless you're
willing to learn that,

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:15.174 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to ever
really understand that.

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:18.811 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that
physics has to do,

00:26:18.811 --> 00:26:22.848 align:middle line:84%
and the best way,
I think, is to have

00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:25.083 align:middle line:84%
enthusiastic
teachers teaching it.

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.618 align:middle line:84%
That's all it really
takes, is just

00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:29.354 align:middle line:84%
to have an enthusiasm
and a desire

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:34.827 align:middle line:84%
to ignite that thing which gets
ignited when you understand

00:26:34.827 --> 00:26:36.695 align:middle line:90%
something for the first time.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, and
those who really

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.531 align:middle line:90%
adhere to it understand it.

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.633 align:middle line:90%
It does take a stretch of mind.

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It gets you out of your
current everyday survival,

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.774 align:middle line:84%
when you really understand the
vastness of quantum physics.

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.375 align:middle line:90%
And I absolutely love that, too.

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:53.212 align:middle line:84%
What does physics have to do
with making money, by the way?

00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:54.379 align:middle line:90%
Just curious.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:55.681 align:middle line:90%
I know this isn't our topic.

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:57.516 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
our Facebook questions

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:59.251 align:middle line:84%
and asking what
someone's asking that.

00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:00.385 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Well, let's see.

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.654 align:middle line:90%
How about Steve Jobs?

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.355 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And how did he relate
physics to making money?

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.093 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, what in all
heaven's name is a computer

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:10.095 align:middle line:90%
but applied physics?

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:90%
And have you ever heard of HD?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.371 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of-- all right.

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Almost every single
device-- I mean,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.909 align:middle line:84%
you've got-- you're
carrying quantum physics

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:84%
in your hand with your
Apple phone, or your iPhone,

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you're using.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.015 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all based
upon quantum physics.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:33.252 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered based upon the
principles of quantum physics.

00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:35.587 align:middle line:84%
Those things don't work
without quantum physics.

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:37.856 align:middle line:90%
So how does physics make money?

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.958 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my God, you ever
heard of the internet?

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean none of that is even
possible without quantum

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.661 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:43.362 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because--

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.796 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And who
knows what's next.

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it connects
space, time, and matter?

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.234 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: It connects us all.

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's opened
up the whole door--

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:51.637 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: --to communication.

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:57.342 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physics has been--
we're living in the quantum

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:90%
age, and it's still developing.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
We're getting into
quantum biology.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.748 align:middle line:84%
We're wanting to
change our lives.

00:28:02.748 --> 00:28:04.116 align:middle line:90%
We're putting in--

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stem cells--

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: --drugs.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.751 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and whatever.

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:06.184 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Stem cells.

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:07.786 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
much we're doing

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:09.121 align:middle line:90%
right now that's based upon--

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:09.588 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Quantum physics.

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:10.956 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: --the
understanding we've

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:13.091 align:middle line:84%
got from-- without
quantum physics,

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
we never would have
understood DNA.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:17.262 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely amazing, this
is what I'm talking about.

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Fred Allan Wolfe is my guest.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.731 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:22.901 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about how to
bring in the concept of quantum

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%
physics to your everyday life.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.272 align:middle line:84%
How to live a quantum
life, essentially.

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
We see it all around us.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.709 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
illuminating that for us.

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:31.577 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:33.245 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take a quick break.

00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%
We will be right back.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.682 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:36.682 --> 00:28:37.416 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:38.216 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right back.

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.271 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:02.074 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is Fred
Allan Wolfe, also known

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:03.742 align:middle line:84%
as Dr. Quantum, like
I like to call him.

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:05.544 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
about quantum physics

00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:07.746 align:middle line:84%
today, and bringing it
into our current reality,

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:08.714 align:middle line:90%
whatever that might be.

00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:10.882 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
an illusion anyway.

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:14.186 align:middle line:84%
So, give me an example of
what this might look like.

00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:16.955 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, you
know the writers

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:20.425 align:middle line:84%
that created a wonderful
television show a couple

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:24.663 align:middle line:84%
years ago-- 20 years ago
or so-- called "Star Trek."

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:26.465 align:middle line:84%
Gene Roddenberry's
great invention,

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:29.534 align:middle line:84%
which led to "Star Trek:
The Next Generation," which

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:31.803 align:middle line:90%
I thought-- I love "Star Trek."

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:32.971 align:middle line:90%
I was a fan.

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:33.872 align:middle line:90%
Bill Shatner, he's a--

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.107 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Way ahead of
its time, that show.

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.174 align:middle line:90%
That was a great show.

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.643 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: But "The
Next Generation"

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:41.847 align:middle line:84%
was really what I consider to
be the best that they've done.

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:84%
And in that
particular show, they

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
had one episode that I thought
was really striking which

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.025 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the notion that we
live in a holographic universe.

00:29:53.025 --> 00:30:00.732 align:middle line:84%
It was a show that was
entitled Ship in a Bottle.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:02.868 align:middle line:90%
You've seen ships in bottles.

00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:06.238 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in this
show is really interesting.

00:30:09.074 --> 00:30:11.677 align:middle line:84%
They have aboard
the Enterprise, they

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:17.015 align:middle line:90%
have a room called the holoroom.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.785 align:middle line:84%
The holoroom is a
room with just walls,

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:22.387 align:middle line:84%
but it's capable of
generating holographic images.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.388 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I remember this.

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:23.722 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:24.222 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yes.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.758 align:middle line:84%
And these holographic
images are so

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:29.628 align:middle line:84%
real that they become
three dimensional

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:31.329 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the room.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:35.033 align:middle line:84%
And so that people can
walk into the holoroom.

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:37.969 align:middle line:84%
And when they walked
into this holoroom

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:42.674 align:middle line:84%
with characters that are being
created by the holographic room

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.976 align:middle line:84%
itself, they can
interact with them.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.079 align:middle line:84%
And the room-- the
characters interact

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:50.482 align:middle line:84%
with the so-called real
characters or the real ship

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:50.982 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.952 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, this
character emerges

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:57.189 align:middle line:84%
who calls himself Dr.
Moriarty, from Sherlock Holmes,

00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
probably because
Data was dreaming up

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:02.794 align:middle line:90%
stories about Sherlock Holmes.

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:11.203 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. M appears and says,
I think, therefore I am.

00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:13.505 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
risk-- I'm not going

00:31:13.505 --> 00:31:16.408 align:middle line:84%
to stay the rest of my
life in this holoroom.

00:31:16.408 --> 00:31:17.776 align:middle line:90%
I have a memory.

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:20.846 align:middle line:84%
Something that Data must
have done to change a program

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:25.016 align:middle line:84%
to give this character the
ability to think what he has

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.051 align:middle line:90%
is a memory.

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.653 align:middle line:84%
I have a memory,
and I know that I

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:31.356 align:middle line:84%
am Dr. Moriarty in
a holographic room.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:34.192 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get out
of this holographic room.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:36.495 align:middle line:84%
Well, the holographic room
looks something like this.

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:42.367 align:middle line:84%
It's a big empty lattice of
possibility with a doorway.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:90%
And so, Dr. Moriarty says, no.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.005 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to stay
in this room anymore.

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:48.573 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here anymore.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk out of
the holoroom entirely.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.146 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says,
you can't do that.

00:31:54.146 --> 00:31:56.648 align:middle line:84%
It's against holographic
principal physics.

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:59.518 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that a
hologram can walk out

00:31:59.518 --> 00:32:00.886 align:middle line:90%
of the holograph room.

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:01.853 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do that.

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.222 align:middle line:90%
You can't exist out there.

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:05.624 align:middle line:90%
That's nonexistence.

00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:07.459 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:90%
And Dr. Moriarty says no.

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:84%
He says, I think,
therefore I am.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.865 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to do that.

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:16.768 align:middle line:90%
So Dr. Moriarty says open.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:17.869 align:middle line:90%
The doors open.

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.705 align:middle line:84%
And he walks out
into the spaceship.

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:23.308 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
crew says, oh my God.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.342 align:middle line:90%
He's done it.

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:26.444 align:middle line:84%
He's created himself
outside of the holoroom.

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.479 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He's become real.

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:28.947 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: How-- He's become real.

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.215 align:middle line:90%
How did he do that?

00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:32.384 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're all wondering, too.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.256 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that this character

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:40.759 align:middle line:84%
could have suddenly emerged
and started walking around

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:42.594 align:middle line:84%
the ship doing all
kinds of mischief

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:45.497 align:middle line:84%
like they usually do in
these kind of stories.

00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:52.204 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that this
character, Dr. Moriarty,

00:32:52.204 --> 00:32:56.741 align:middle line:90%
really never left the holo room.

00:32:56.741 --> 00:33:00.412 align:middle line:84%
But being clever, and
learning the creative process,

00:33:00.412 --> 00:33:03.915 align:middle line:84%
and learning to identify with
the creator process-- which

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:07.519 align:middle line:84%
in this case was Data's fertile
mind-- I'm kind of making this

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.353 align:middle line:90%
up as I go along.

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:12.691 align:middle line:84%
It may not be exactly
the way the stories went.

00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:84%
He created a holoroom within the
holoroom, within the holoroom,

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:21.499 align:middle line:84%
within the holoroom,
within the holoroom.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:25.971 align:middle line:84%
So that even though he appeared
to walk out of the holoroom

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:29.608 align:middle line:84%
into the spaceship, he never
had really left the real quote,

00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:31.276 align:middle line:90%
unquote holoroom.

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.044 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you
applying this at home?

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:33.545 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:35.413 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
this in your own life,

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:84%
how we are creating an image,
an illusion of ourselves.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.119 align:middle line:90%
Are we really real?

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:41.953 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Right.

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:47.392 align:middle line:84%
Right, and Dr. Moriarty
thinks that he is now real,

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:50.295 align:middle line:84%
and he wants to
explore the universe.

00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:53.865 align:middle line:84%
So Picard, the captain,
thinks of a very clever way

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:54.799 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.736 align:middle line:84%
He programs the
whole-- once they

00:33:57.736 --> 00:34:01.206 align:middle line:84%
catch on to what's
going on-- the crew

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:06.845 align:middle line:84%
catches-- or takes
the software that's

00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:11.116 align:middle line:84%
generating this whole thing
and encapsulate it inside

00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:14.619 align:middle line:84%
of a cube, together
with images of the crew

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:18.322 align:middle line:84%
so that Dr. Moriarty
never really catches on

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.692 align:middle line:84%
that he's part of a
holographic computer program.

00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:21.326 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:34:21.326 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.297 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And so then, the
crew member holding up a cube

00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:29.801 align:middle line:84%
containing the whole kit and
caboodle with Dr. Moriarty,

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.437 align:middle line:84%
and Picard, and the
ship, and even visions

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:35.774 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe--
holding up the cube,

00:34:35.774 --> 00:34:40.946 align:middle line:84%
wondering, wait a minute,
what is really going on here?

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:44.815 align:middle line:90%
Is this really the way it is?

00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Or am I, myself, a
projection from some bigger

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
holographic room that
I don't know about.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.623 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is what we are.

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:56.027 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Which is what
the current physics says.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That we are.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.865 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: So, we are actually
like this story that

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:04.502 align:middle line:84%
is projected from
some bigger holoroom.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:07.605 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
holoroom are the surfaces

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:11.409 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning and ending
of time, where the mind of God

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.378 align:middle line:90%
is fertile and existing.

00:35:13.378 --> 00:35:17.916 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, we can really
dream up our own reality.

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.751 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: If we can
imagine this, we

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.886 align:middle line:90%
can begin to identify with it.

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And you actually get
a chance to do it.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.891 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:28.927 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: When you die.

00:35:28.927 --> 00:35:30.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't it a little late?

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:33.965 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: You also get a chance
to do it when you're born.

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You get glimpses of who you
really are at those moments.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.938 align:middle line:90%
But very quickly--

00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:40.872 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why don't we--

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: --before and after--

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.042 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --experience
that in our daily lives?

00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's a good question.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:49.848 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that
you can identify with it,

00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:54.953 align:middle line:84%
but you have to realize
that being holographic

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
make the world have

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:00.158 align:middle line:90%
any difficulties with it.

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.527 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
hard to push around.

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.696 align:middle line:84%
There's no matter
to push around.

00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:07.065 align:middle line:84%
There's no striving
for anything.

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:09.134 align:middle line:90%
There's no worthwhileness.

00:36:09.134 --> 00:36:11.803 align:middle line:90%
Everything's, so to speak, free.

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.372 align:middle line:84%
And while that sounds wonderful
for maybe the first four

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:17.008 align:middle line:84%
or five days of that kind
of, oh everything's free,

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.943 align:middle line:84%
I can have whatever I
want, after a while,

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:20.512 align:middle line:84%
when you realize you
can have anything

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:23.348 align:middle line:84%
you want whenever you need
it, or whenever you want it,

00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:24.849 align:middle line:90%
you don't want anything anymore.

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
What you want is the
opposite of that.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Exactly how
long would that take?

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:28.386 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Oh, four or five days.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.154 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:29.788 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's about it.

00:36:29.788 --> 00:36:30.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:31.122 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Four or five
days of getting anything

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.458 align:middle line:84%
you want, any time you
want it, it's about enough.

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:35.093 align:middle line:84%
You'd be bored after
four or five days.

00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:37.362 align:middle line:84%
Some people are bored after
that after a couple of minutes.

00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
that's interesting.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.566 align:middle line:84%
Because I would want
to have other people

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:84%
experience it with me, or
share that with other people,

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:47.806 align:middle line:84%
or in some way pay it forward
or something like that.

00:36:47.806 --> 00:36:48.807 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:36:48.807 --> 00:36:49.641 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:51.576 align:middle line:84%
It would be pretty
lonely, wouldn't it?

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:54.579 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It could turn out to be
a kind of a lonely experience.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:55.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we want
to share it with everyone.

00:36:55.747 --> 00:36:56.314 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: The being all one.

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:58.083 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say you realize now

00:36:58.083 --> 00:37:00.852 align:middle line:84%
that you're everything
there is, everything

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
that was, everything
that will be.

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:07.759 align:middle line:84%
In fact was, will be,
is have no meaning,

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:10.361 align:middle line:84%
because you're beyond
space and time.

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:14.466 align:middle line:84%
So you are all
there is eternally.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:17.235 align:middle line:84%
How would you feel being
all there is forever

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and ever and ever and ever
and ever and never, ever

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.644 align:middle line:84%
having anything other
than eternal existence

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:30.849 align:middle line:84%
forever and ever, being able
to do whatever you want.

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:34.619 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you start to think
about creating limitation.

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.453 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:38.957 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to-- I mean, think about
that at home and then breathe.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:42.193 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a vast,
vast, vast concept.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:45.396 align:middle line:84%
And then, you would think
about where are the boundaries.

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.498 align:middle line:90%
Just like a little kid--

00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:46.764 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's exactly right.

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.933 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --wondering where--
they come into the world

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:50.535 align:middle line:84%
and the universe
is a blur to them.

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:53.171 align:middle line:84%
And they look for where they can
bump up against it to find out

00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:54.372 align:middle line:90%
how they are in relationship.

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Exactly, exactly.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.108 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely
that would be there.

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So, we are a live
show here, and we're

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.145 align:middle line:84%
encouraging you to
communicate with us

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:01.246 align:middle line:90%
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:04.549 align:middle line:84%
And we have some questions
coming in here, too.

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:06.351 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:07.719 align:middle line:84%
Jan asked about
what do you think

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:09.521 align:middle line:90%
about the law of attraction.

00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about that in
quantum physics perspectives?

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.093 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, I've said a lot
about that on my web page.

00:38:15.093 --> 00:38:17.495 align:middle line:84%
You can read a longer
answer than I'm

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%
going to give right here.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.999 align:middle line:84%
But the law of
attraction is really

00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:27.305 align:middle line:84%
a kind of more of a
sales kind of a thing.

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.441 align:middle line:84%
It's to get people outside of
their normal kind of thinking.

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:33.545 align:middle line:84%
But the law of
attraction in physics

00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:37.315 align:middle line:84%
is that opposites attract,
not likes attract.

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.417 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.351 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:43.555 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, a positive
electrical charge

00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:46.324 align:middle line:84%
does not attract another
positive electrical charge.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.193 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it repels it.

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:50.862 align:middle line:90%
So likes repel each other.

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:52.931 align:middle line:84%
A positive electrical
charge will

00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:55.099 align:middle line:84%
attract a negative
electrical charge.

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:56.634 align:middle line:84%
And if it didn't do
that, we wouldn't

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:84%
have electricity nor even
the existence of atoms.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.838 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That explains
a lot of things.

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:01.506 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:04.108 align:middle line:84%
So in relationships that
explains that, but what about--

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: And often
in relationships

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.045 align:middle line:84%
we find a similar
of kind of thing,

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:09.547 align:middle line:90%
opposites attracting each other.

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:11.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about goals?

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:90%
When you want to attract goals?

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.752 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well,
rather than thinking

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:17.655 align:middle line:84%
about attracting
something to yourself,

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:84%
think about what it is that
you can give of yourself

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.429 align:middle line:84%
which will make
your life better.

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:27.165 align:middle line:84%
Rather than bringing
something in,

00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:30.235 align:middle line:84%
what can you push out
from yourself that'll

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:32.437 align:middle line:84%
make your life more
interesting and better.

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:35.707 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really in the
giving that the greater joy

00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:37.108 align:middle line:90%
is achieved.

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:39.711 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual teachers have
been telling this for years,

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:41.479 align:middle line:84%
but until you actually
start doing it,

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
know what I'm talking.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.116 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If we could all do
that on a quantum level,

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.951 align:middle line:84%
this would be a different
place, absolutely.

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:49.053 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Well, we're doing it.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.322 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're getting
more people doing it.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.224 align:middle line:84%
And people are asking
the right questions.

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
It is going on.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.961 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to continue.

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.096 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good news.

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:00.398 align:middle line:84%
All right, so our
slide that we have here

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:03.635 align:middle line:84%
is about the teachings
of Chuang Tzu.

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:04.535 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: That's right.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.573 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient--
you know, I've just

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:10.608 align:middle line:84%
taken you through the
"Star Trek" story.

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:14.612 align:middle line:84%
But Chuang Tzu was
a great philosopher.

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:16.614 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote these words.

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:19.684 align:middle line:84%
He says that someday will
come this Great Awakening.

00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:22.587 align:middle line:84%
And we're all going
to realize something,

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:28.426 align:middle line:84%
that life is no
more than a dream.

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Yet the foolish
will go on thinking

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:37.535 align:middle line:84%
that they are awake, and that
everything-- this is real.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.903 align:middle line:90%
This is reality, darn it.

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.605 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:43.941 align:middle line:84%
And surveying the
panorama of all the things

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that make up our lives, they
will call this one a prince.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.615 align:middle line:84%
And that one over
there, well he's

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:52.884 align:middle line:90%
richer than, gosh, anybody else.

00:40:52.884 --> 00:40:53.651 align:middle line:90%
And that's a slob.

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:55.353 align:middle line:90%
He's poorer than anybody else.

00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:56.254 align:middle line:90%
And he's a nothing.

00:40:56.254 --> 00:40:57.288 align:middle line:90%
He's a something.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.156 align:middle line:84%
I want to be with
the somethings,

00:40:58.156 --> 00:40:59.057 align:middle line:90%
not with the nothings.

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:01.726 align:middle line:84%
And all that kind of stuff
that we keep going through.

00:41:01.726 --> 00:41:05.997 align:middle line:84%
And all that kind of thinking,
and thinking and talking,

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:09.500 align:middle line:84%
all that is part of just
no more than a dream.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:16.107 align:middle line:84%
And I, who say this, Chuang
Tzu said, I who say this,

00:41:16.107 --> 00:41:17.742 align:middle line:90%
I am also a dream.

00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:20.812 align:middle line:90%
I, too, am a dream.

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:24.782 align:middle line:84%
Is this a butterfly dreaming
he's Chuang Tzu or Chuang

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.451 align:middle line:90%
Tzu dreaming he's a butterfly?

00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:28.052 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it the
caterpillar dreaming

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.921 align:middle line:84%
that he's a butterfly or
the butterfly dreaming

00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:30.321 align:middle line:90%
he's a caterpillar?

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: The caterpillar
dreams he's a butterfly.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:32.924 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, he does.

00:41:32.924 --> 00:41:34.192 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Otherwise he
wouldn't go through all that.

00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He has the DNA
strand of a butterfly.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.228 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: He's got the desire.

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:38.763 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, he
does, absolutely.

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:39.831 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Because it
takes a lot of work

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.733 align:middle line:84%
to make yourself
into a caterpillar.

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:42.567 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One of our--

00:41:42.567 --> 00:41:44.001 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: I mean,
into a butterfly.

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely,
takes a lot of work.

00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Ryan is asking
what about deja vu?

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.542 align:middle line:84%
Is that a collision
of realities?

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.811 align:middle line:84%
And parallel universes,
another-- Patrick

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:56.614 align:middle line:84%
is also asking how do we access
these parallel universes?

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.215 align:middle line:90%
Do they exist?

00:41:57.215 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, parallel
realities and deja vu

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
are really similar questions
in a certain sense.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:84%
When you have a deja vu
experience, what you're

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:10.995 align:middle line:84%
experiencing is, in a certain
sense, what at the time

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:84%
was about to be and
you're reminded of that.

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:21.005 align:middle line:84%
It's really something which lets
you know that you've seen this

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:24.175 align:middle line:84%
before, in a parallel
world, possibly.

00:42:24.175 --> 00:42:27.578 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the deja
vu experience is about.

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:28.246 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:30.581 align:middle line:84%
I remember having this
conversation before.

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:34.051 align:middle line:84%
Well, indeed, you may
have had that conversation

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:39.023 align:middle line:84%
before in your parallel world
self or your otherworldly self.

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:40.758 align:middle line:84%
So deja vu is a kind
of reminder of that.

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:42.193 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
really believe that?

00:42:42.193 --> 00:42:42.693 align:middle line:90%
That that--

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.228 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Yeah, well,
because there's

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:47.432 align:middle line:84%
no reason why we don't
have these parallel worlds.

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:48.766 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What makes you say that?

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: What?

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.035 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what quantum
physics is telling us.

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whether I
believe it or not,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.939 align:middle line:84%
it's just that
quantum physics works

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.107 align:middle line:90%
to explain a lot of stuff.

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:58.276 align:middle line:84%
And it does say there
are parallel worlds.

00:42:58.276 --> 00:43:02.013 align:middle line:84%
So whether we like it or
not, it seems to be there.

00:43:02.013 --> 00:43:04.215 align:middle line:84%
There are two kinds
of vu experiences.

00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:08.252 align:middle line:84%
There's deja vu and
there's jamais vu.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And jamais vu is never having
had this experience before.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.793 align:middle line:84%
Of the two, I prefer jamais
vu, because jamais vu

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:16.794 align:middle line:90%
is really exciting.

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:17.261 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Experiencing
it for the first time.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:19.397 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: I've never
done this before, wow.

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:22.066 align:middle line:84%
Deja vu, well, everything,
in a way, is deja vu.

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:25.236 align:middle line:84%
If things are so deja vu that
you've done them over and over

00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:28.873 align:middle line:84%
again, they get--
it becomes jamais vu

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:30.508 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
the experience of not

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:90%
having had that experience.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said something that
I don't want you to gloss over.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.281 align:middle line:84%
You said that quantum
physics really

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:90%
does explain parallel universes.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.351 align:middle line:90%
My mind is hooked on--

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:41.552 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: They're necessary.

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.454 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more about that.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.422 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, because
quantum physics

00:43:44.422 --> 00:43:46.491 align:middle line:84%
says there are many--
remember the bubbles?

00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:49.327 align:middle line:84%
There are many
possible-- each bubble

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:51.929 align:middle line:90%
is a possible world, a universe.

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:55.233 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics
tells us that there

00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:58.269 align:middle line:84%
are many possibilities
that must coexist,

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:00.271 align:middle line:84%
that we don't just
have one or the other;

00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:02.507 align:middle line:90%
we get one and the other.

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:05.776 align:middle line:84%
So parallel worlds are just a
different possible storylines

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:08.145 align:middle line:84%
which can develop through
those bubbles of possibility.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.147 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let me bring
this into practical use.

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:13.885 align:middle line:84%
So, if we want to try to
determine the outcome.

00:44:13.885 --> 00:44:16.954 align:middle line:84%
Say you're in a lawsuit, or
you want the positive truth

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:17.588 align:middle line:90%
to come out.

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:20.858 align:middle line:84%
Can you access the parallel
universe for the positive truth

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.828 align:middle line:90%
to come out of some situation?

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: You can.

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:28.633 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's not very
likely that it'll happen.

00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:31.135 align:middle line:84%
It depends on a lot of
factors, which may have more

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:36.707 align:middle line:84%
to do with your own
personal you-ness.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:40.344 align:middle line:84%
The big trick in identifying
with the big dreamer

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:84%
is to remember who
you really are.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:48.085 align:middle line:84%
And you're not just that person
who wants that particular goal.

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:50.121 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a lot
of different influences.

00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.756 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: There's a
lot of different yous

00:44:51.756 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:90%
that are going on.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.793 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you identify
with the big dreamer,

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:58.996 align:middle line:84%
then you have a feeling
of almost satisfaction

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.331 align:middle line:90%
with whatever happens.

00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:03.568 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a lot of
different observers, as well,

00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:90%
affecting and impacting it.

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:07.138 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, there's
different illusions

00:45:07.138 --> 00:45:08.506 align:middle line:90%
of different observers.

00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:11.309 align:middle line:84%
Because one-- There's illusions
of-- there's only one observer

00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:90%
in all this stuff.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.077 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You.

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:13.578 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: You.

00:45:13.578 --> 00:45:15.112 align:middle line:90%
And you are the big observer.

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:16.914 align:middle line:90%
But you have to remember that.

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:17.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely fascinating.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.086 align:middle line:84%
All right, so how--
I asked you about how

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.921 align:middle line:84%
this could change
our past or present.

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:26.257 align:middle line:84%
You've said many
times here that I

00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:28.459 align:middle line:90%
am the universe, that I am God.

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:29.694 align:middle line:90%
You've said that many times.

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:32.897 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this statement
before in different references

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:34.198 align:middle line:90%
and texts and so forth.

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:37.435 align:middle line:84%
How does quantum
physics explain that?

00:45:37.435 --> 00:45:39.036 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It explains
it by bringing

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:44.141 align:middle line:84%
into our way of understanding
how the universe gets created

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:49.213 align:middle line:84%
that there must be a
field which allows matter

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:51.349 align:middle line:90%
to come into existence.

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And without this field,
and in the currents

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.855 align:middle line:84%
searched there--
because they don't

00:45:57.855 --> 00:46:01.726 align:middle line:84%
get into mind of God type of
talk in physics laboratories.

00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They call it the Higgs
field, H-I-G-G-S field,

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:11.235 align:middle line:84%
which they believe is necessary
for producing the interactions

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:15.906 align:middle line:84%
for these spin one half light
particles to bounce back

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:19.143 align:middle line:84%
and forth in a zig zag dance,
appearing to slow down,

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:22.046 align:middle line:84%
and therefore appear
as material existence.

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:29.754 align:middle line:84%
So this minefield is what is
the essence of quantum physics.

00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the
essence of reality.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Reality.

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:33.824 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say.

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.827 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to say it
before you because I'm just

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.029 align:middle line:90%
grasping this along with you.

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:38.863 align:middle line:90%
But I did get it.

00:46:38.863 --> 00:46:40.798 align:middle line:90%
A reality, yeah, absolutely.

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.367 align:middle line:90%
All right, so, I love this.

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:44.635 align:middle line:90%
You guys are really engaging.

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.304 align:middle line:84%
There's great questions coming
in on Facebook and Twitter.

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:50.274 align:middle line:90%
So, is time really speeding up?

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:51.942 align:middle line:84%
One of our Facebook
listeners is asking.

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.244 align:middle line:90%
I love it, yeah.

00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:56.914 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, you know, time
speeding up or slowing down

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:02.586 align:middle line:84%
depends upon which way
you have of observing it.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:08.526 align:middle line:84%
So, yes you can experience time
speeding up or slowing down.

00:47:08.526 --> 00:47:11.762 align:middle line:84%
And we all know various
ways of talking about that.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:15.066 align:middle line:84%
Put your finger on a hot
stove and time goes very fast.

00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.636 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a busy
day, time goes very fast.

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:19.136 align:middle line:90%
Yes

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.805 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Right.

00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:25.042 align:middle line:84%
If you're making love
with your favorite lover,

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:27.545 align:middle line:84%
time can sometimes goes
just the other way around.

00:47:27.545 --> 00:47:30.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean, go too fast,
too slow, depending

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:30.648 align:middle line:84%
on how well you like
the other person.

00:47:30.648 --> 00:47:31.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your observer.

00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:32.116 align:middle line:90%
Being the observer, yes.

00:47:32.116 --> 00:47:34.685 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: So, there's
various ways that time

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.754 align:middle line:84%
could go depending
upon the observer.

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:38.856 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at are relative events.

00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:40.691 align:middle line:84%
But in relativity
theory, we also

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:43.728 align:middle line:84%
know that a moving
observer experiences

00:47:43.728 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:84%
time running slow in comparison
with a rest observer.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.436 align:middle line:84%
But what that deals
with is really

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:56.907 align:middle line:84%
two different ways of observing
and trying to compare them,

00:47:56.907 --> 00:48:02.980 align:middle line:84%
one to the other, based upon one
or the other's point of view.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.251 align:middle line:84%
Because from each point of
view, the other guy is moving.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:10.454 align:middle line:84%
And so, from my point of
view, if other guy's moving,

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:13.190 align:middle line:84%
his time runs slow,
from his point of view,

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.793 align:middle line:84%
since I'm the one moving, he
would say my time runs slow.

00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:17.394 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You gave an
example of two cars

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:19.964 align:middle line:84%
moving parallel to each other
but moving at the same time.

00:48:19.964 --> 00:48:22.199 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like you're
moving at the same time.

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
One could go faster or slower
as you move along, right?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.105 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, the
relative speed-- yes.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.241 align:middle line:84%
You would say
that-- exactly that,

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:32.109 align:middle line:84%
that if you're going
along at the same speed,

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:34.145 align:middle line:90%
it looks like nobody's moving.

00:48:34.145 --> 00:48:35.946 align:middle line:84%
But if one guy
starts to speed up,

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:39.216 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you're going very
slow relative to the other guy.

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:41.919 align:middle line:84%
And he's-- or you could
say you're standing still

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.254 align:middle line:90%
and he's going backwards.

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:44.088 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:46.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, so, another question
coming in from Facebook.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.795 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually time travel
and transcend space and time?

00:48:50.795 --> 00:48:52.496 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a
slide about that.

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:58.169 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, basically, we are
time traveling all of the time.

00:48:58.169 --> 00:49:04.108 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we've learned
to hold onto, or fixate, on who

00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.343 align:middle line:84%
and what we are at
the particular moment.

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.479 align:middle line:84%
And that fixation
becomes so ingrained--

00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:09.547 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Boy, do we, yes.

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:11.482 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: --that it becomes
like-- have you ever

00:49:11.482 --> 00:49:14.752 align:middle line:84%
seen people that are
always tight fisted?

00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
relax your hand.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.755 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can't.

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:22.259 align:middle line:84%
That's how we are about our ego,
I. We just can't open it up.

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:24.061 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We get so
wrapped up in who we are.

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.863 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: We're wrapped up
in who and what we are.

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.298 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
illusion-- then it

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.233 align:middle line:84%
seems like what I'm
talking about is nonsense.

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:31.268 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean take
time-- I can't time travel.

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:32.303 align:middle line:90%
I'm here now.

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:33.737 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let
me ask about you.

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:38.776 align:middle line:84%
When someone asks you what
do you do, what do you say?

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:40.711 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It depends
on what they ask me.

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.112 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they
ask me about do I

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.581 align:middle line:84%
time travel or
something like that.

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:43.881 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:45.216 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, like
when they say hi, Fred.

00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:46.383 align:middle line:90%
What do you do for a living?

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.454 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:58.195 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: Well, my basic
thing that I do, I breathe.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.431 align:middle line:90%
I smell.

00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:02.666 align:middle line:90%
I hear.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.535 align:middle line:90%
I taste.

00:50:04.535 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I touch.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.007 align:middle line:90%
I think, therefore I am.

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:10.841 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good answer.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.445 align:middle line:84%
Very good answer, no, that's
perfect coming from you.

00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:18.616 align:middle line:84%
One of the listeners is asking--
Heather-- do you meditate?

00:50:18.616 --> 00:50:20.117 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about your--

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.619 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: I'd like
to talk about that.

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:23.888 align:middle line:84%
Because meditation
is a word that

00:50:23.888 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:90%
can be very easily confused.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:30.728 align:middle line:84%
And it may not mean
what you think it means.

00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, for most of us,
in our business lifetimes,

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:37.201 align:middle line:84%
means stopping and
getting off the trolley,

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:42.406 align:middle line:84%
and sitting still, and going om
mani padme hum, or oh, money,

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:45.943 align:middle line:84%
pad my home, or whatever
you call meditation.

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:48.445 align:middle line:84%
And it could mean any of
those kinds of things,

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.747 align:middle line:90%
and that's a meditation.

00:50:49.747 --> 00:50:58.622 align:middle line:84%
But meditation can
also mean-- I smell.

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:01.025 align:middle line:90%
I hear.

00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:02.726 align:middle line:90%
I listen.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.528 align:middle line:90%
I taste.

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.764 align:middle line:90%
I touch.

00:51:06.764 --> 00:51:08.866 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:51:08.866 --> 00:51:13.837 align:middle line:84%
Meditation can be the
awareness of the wonders

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:14.772 align:middle line:90%
of your own existence.

00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:21.245 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhist
meditation technique,

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.280 align:middle line:84%
you think all they do
is sit and meditate.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:23.781 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:24.548 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: No.

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.717 align:middle line:90%
They do walking meditation.

00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:28.953 align:middle line:90%
And what do they have you do?

00:51:28.953 --> 00:51:34.058 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and smell the
flowers, feel the wind,

00:51:34.058 --> 00:51:37.261 align:middle line:90%
listen to the air.

00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:40.631 align:middle line:84%
Meditation could
be a slowing down.

00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:42.566 align:middle line:90%
It could be a speeding up.

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.468 align:middle line:84%
You're a runner,
and you're running.

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.071 align:middle line:84%
You're a baseball player, and
you're about to hit a ball.

00:51:47.071 --> 00:51:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Meditation will allow you to
hit the ball even though it's

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.043 align:middle line:84%
coming at you at nearly
100 miles per hour.

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is the aware--
is putting your awareness

00:51:58.015 --> 00:52:01.685 align:middle line:84%
to work, so to speak,
without working

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.654 align:middle line:84%
at putting your
awareness to work.

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:05.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
beautiful thing to say.

00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:08.792 align:middle line:84%
Especially now, at this hour
in the day, to have that moment

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:09.727 align:middle line:90%
was really special.

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:12.296 align:middle line:84%
Because we can tend to
get moving very, very

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:13.697 align:middle line:90%
fast in this society.

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.999 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciated that.

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:17.601 align:middle line:84%
Fred Allan Wolfe
was in the movie

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.836 align:middle line:90%
"What the Bleep do We Know?"

00:52:18.836 --> 00:52:24.308 align:middle line:84%
A great movie that we
have on Gaiam TV, as well.

00:52:24.308 --> 00:52:28.345 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- there's a piece
that we have from that movie.

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great film.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.981 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a look at that.

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:34.785 align:middle line:84%
It kind of encapsulates
what we have to say.

00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:37.788 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: First of all, let's
talk about the subatomic world.

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:40.324 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk about what
it's telling us about reality.

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:42.826 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I want to tell
you about the subatomic world

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.762 align:middle line:84%
is it's totally
a fantasy created

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:48.632 align:middle line:84%
by mad physicists trying to
figure out what the heck is

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:51.201 align:middle line:84%
going when they do these
little experiments.

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:54.505 align:middle line:84%
By little experiments, I mean
big energy in little spaces

00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:56.273 align:middle line:90%
and little pieces of time.

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.976 align:middle line:84%
It gets pretty nutty at
that realm of things.

00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:00.878 align:middle line:84%
And so, subatomic
physics was invented

00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:90%
to try to figure that all out.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.149 align:middle line:84%
We need a new
science down there.

00:53:05.149 --> 00:53:06.884 align:middle line:90%
It's called quantum physics.

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:12.356 align:middle line:84%
And it is subject to a whole
range of debatable hypotheses,

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:15.459 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, feelings,
intuitions as

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:17.461 align:middle line:84%
to what the heck
is really going on.

00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:19.797 align:middle line:84%
This leads, naturally,
to wonder do

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:22.733 align:middle line:84%
people-- are people affecting
the world of reality

00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:23.834 align:middle line:90%
that they see?

00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:25.769 align:middle line:90%
You betcha they are.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:29.406 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us affects
the reality that we see,

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:33.243 align:middle line:84%
even if we try to hide
from that and play victim.

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:35.746 align:middle line:90%
We all are doing it.

00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:37.314 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is--
that was beautifully

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:39.016 align:middle line:84%
done by Will Arntz
and Betsy Chasse.

00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:39.917 align:middle line:90%
It's a great film.

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:43.387 align:middle line:84%
And it shows-- highlights all
sorts of interesting things,

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.656 align:middle line:90%
all things quantum physics.

00:53:45.656 --> 00:53:47.391 align:middle line:84%
We have just a few
minutes left, but I

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:50.461 align:middle line:84%
wanted to mention
that all of this,

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:53.197 align:middle line:84%
what we have to talk about here,
what we've been talking about,

00:53:53.197 --> 00:53:56.266 align:middle line:84%
is how quantum physics
connects us all.

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:59.069 align:middle line:84%
It can change the way
that we view our past.

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.305 align:middle line:84%
It can change the way
that we create our future.

00:54:01.305 --> 00:54:04.775 align:middle line:84%
It can change our
current existence,

00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:07.578 align:middle line:84%
because we are always
the observers, correct?

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:08.245 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Yes.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:10.514 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you might do
when you get out of here--

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.583 align:middle line:84%
or wherever you
are right now, is

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:14.885 align:middle line:84%
to begin to experience
that connection.

00:54:14.885 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
We all can do it.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.821 align:middle line:90%
I do it all the time.

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:21.325 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people I meet,
I've never met them before,

00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and the connection will arise.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.864 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an awareness
that comes about that

00:54:26.864 --> 00:54:31.502 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond the words or
things that you can do.

00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even--
it's not what you're

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.306 align:middle line:84%
doing at the moment that
makes that connection appear.

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:38.742 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, somebody
will come into your life,

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and you'll feel connected.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:43.113 align:middle line:84%
I've had this happen
many, many times

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:46.416 align:middle line:84%
in many different countries with
many different kinds of people,

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.185 align:middle line:90%
and it always amazes me.

00:54:48.185 --> 00:54:52.322 align:middle line:84%
Because at that moment,
there's the knowing

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:57.194 align:middle line:84%
that we are the one
rather than the illusion

00:54:57.194 --> 00:55:00.964 align:middle line:84%
that we are the separate
beings that we're disguised

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.966 align:middle line:84%
as playing in this
particular role.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.569 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's exactly what
has happened with me, with you

00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:06.270 align:middle line:90%
here today.

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:07.137 align:middle line:90%
>>FRED: Oh, well, thank you.

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.139 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --I've met you
and connected with you

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:10.140 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.241 align:middle line:90%
And it has been awesome.

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we've connected
with the audience.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So we've all become one in
this hour, here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.581 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you so much.

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:19.983 align:middle line:84%
I've learned so much
about time travel,

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.719 align:middle line:84%
about how we're the creators
of our own experiences

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:23.554 align:middle line:90%
and the observer.

00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:24.821 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you so much.

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.256 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED: It's been
a pleasure, Lisa.

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:27.691 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having
me on your show.

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.592 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:55:28.592 --> 00:55:29.693 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
for us, too.

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:30.827 align:middle line:90%
And I hope that you enjoyed it.
