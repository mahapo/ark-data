be an environmentalist?

The film "A Fierce Green
Fire," directed and written

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.803 align:middle line:84%
by my guest today, Mark
Kitchell, answers that question

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.574 align:middle line:84%
by documenting the largest
movement of the 20th Century,

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.576 align:middle line:90%

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.178 align:middle line:84%
"A Fierce Green Fire" brings
together all of the major parts

of environmentalism
and connects them.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.084 align:middle line:84%
It focuses on activism, people
fighting to save their homes,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.253 align:middle line:90%
their lives, and the future.

the equality of extinction.

said, "Wait a second,

there's probably 4 things;

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:90%
it was my wife's idea.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.424 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.659 align:middle line:84%

happened on the freeway going

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.461 align:middle line:84%
from LA up to San Francisco,
and we started riffing

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:52.499 align:middle line:84%
on all the cool important
great stories.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.201 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a film
that had to be made,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.137 align:middle line:90%
and if not by me somebody else.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%

big picture exploration

of the environmental movement.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:06.346 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, this
is sort of what I do.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.417 align:middle line:84%
Berkeley in the '60s
was a sort of history

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
of a social movement composed
of interviews and archival,

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.389 align:middle line:84%
and really trying to
get at the meaning of it

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.925 align:middle line:84%
in a bigger historical
sense and get

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.962 align:middle line:84%
at the meaning and
where it's going.

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we were trying
to do all those things,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.598 align:middle line:90%
there needed to be that film.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.201 align:middle line:84%

certain affinity with history

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.905 align:middle line:84%
or with the environmental
movement specifically?

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.374 align:middle line:84%

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:38.511 align:middle line:84%

up making for whatever reason.

>> Mark Kitchell: And
I do love history.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:46.152 align:middle line:84%
And I was -- you know, I
had a déjà vu experience,

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
like I can't believe

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.789 align:middle line:84%
that somebody hasn't
made this film already.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.257 align:middle line:84%

happened on Berkeley in the '60s

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:54.494 align:middle line:84%

on this, and, you know,

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
filmmakers these days,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.398 align:middle line:84%
how did this one slip
through the cracks?

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.834 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And I've seen so many
films on environmentalism

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.903 align:middle line:84%
and on the problems, and
the lack of solutions,

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:08.475 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't seen -- this
film built the case for me.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.077 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
important to see.

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:17.117 align:middle line:84%
And this title, "A Fierce Green
Fire," what does that mean?

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, we were
trying to find a good title.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:24.257 align:middle line:84%
We had been calling it "The
Environmental History Project."

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:84%
But it's a famous
story in the movement,

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:30.163 align:middle line:84%
one of the pioneering
figures, Aldo Leopold

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.767 align:middle line:84%
in the 1910s was a
young forest ranger

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:38.138 align:middle line:84%
in a young national forest
that had just come into being.

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:41.341 align:middle line:84%
And his job, among other
things, was to kill predators.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.245 align:middle line:84%
And so they were riding
the range in Arizona,

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:50.483 align:middle line:84%
and they saw a wolf down in the
ravine and instinctually pulled

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.753 align:middle line:90%
out his rifle and shot it.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.956 align:middle line:84%
And the cubs scattered
and they went down to see,

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and in the dying she wolf's
eyes he saw fierce green fire.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.498 align:middle line:90%
And that was his awakening.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%

It is so impactful.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.871 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this moment

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:84%
and how you captured
this in the film.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.341 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>> For a young forest
ranger named Aldo Leopold,

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:26.085 align:middle line:84%
the awakening was seeing a
fierce green fire in the eyes

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.922 align:middle line:90%
of a wolf he had just shot.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.523 align:middle line:90%
>> The fierce green fire he saw

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:33.126 align:middle line:84%
in her eyes was a real
turning point for him,

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.664 align:middle line:84%
in terms of understanding
that life has a part, a piece.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:41.901 align:middle line:84%
And he had a personal
realization of what it means

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:47.974 align:middle line:84%
to tear away, to take away
a part of the realm of life.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.909 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at the manifestation

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.279 align:middle line:84%
of environmentalism in the
world, it's because people one

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.117 align:middle line:84%
by one by one have
had that experience.

That's why you write
these documentaries.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.565 align:middle line:84%
I explained this because I have
my daughter watch it with me,

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:16.102 align:middle line:84%
and she was -- she asked
why the wolf had to die,

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.871 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to
explain that wolf,

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
because you were
able to document it.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.208 align:middle line:90%
She lost her life so that

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.177 align:middle line:84%
so many other wolves
could be saved,

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and so many other

could stock.

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and yet it so atomized
and episodic.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really have
a sense of itself.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.682 align:middle line:84%
And so I was trying
to put it altogether

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and give it some
deeper sense of meaning.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.525 align:middle line:84%
And I was aiming specifically at
our kids, more than us who lived

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.928 align:middle line:84%
through it, the rising
environmentalism.

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.262 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And it's
been very effective that way.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:22.035 align:middle line:84%
But there are specific themes
and meanings within the film,

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle line:84%
certainly one of the main themes
going on is bottom up movements

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.175 align:middle line:90%
versus top-down politics.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.743 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes; yes.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And
the need for both and --

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:34.681 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, also that
it started, you know,

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.181 align:middle line:90%
when it started in the '70s --

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.517 align:middle line:84%
and you document
when the EPA formed,

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
and 20 million people showed

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.691 align:middle line:84%
up for the first Earth
Day march in 1970.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.061 align:middle line:84%
This might be a fact that many
people know, but I didn't.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:52.398 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going on
every single year since then.

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:53.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Not
always 20 million.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.568 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: No; not always
20 billion.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:59.739 align:middle line:84%
Why did it -- why do you
think it has decreased?

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:03.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, there's
fatigue, and it's hard to hold

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:90%
onto these issues as important,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:11.551 align:middle line:84%
the central issues
of the society.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.253 align:middle line:84%
The weight that the
environmental movement,

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:17.323 align:middle line:84%
environmental issues have
in society has often been,

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
you know, subjugated to things
like wars, or civil rights,

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:26.699 align:middle line:84%
or anti-nuclear, more
pressing movements.

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:29.769 align:middle line:84%
It's so intangible
this movement,

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
especially as it's grown
from saving your local swamp

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.976 align:middle line:90%
to the world's climate.

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:46.052 align:middle line:84%
People just -- I think people
get weary of it, you know.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.022 align:middle line:84%
There's such a thing as
eco bummer, you know.

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.089 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Eco bummer?

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell:
Yes, yes, yes; it's --

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.059 align:middle line:84%
we're always the
people who are --

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: -- you can't
drive so fast and you can't --

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:59.932 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Right; and we take away
your modern conveniences, yes.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes, right.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.236 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: However, you
chose to make this film

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:04.937 align:middle line:84%
in a historical way
for a reason.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:07.707 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
history that you've documented

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:84%
in this film will make the
impact you want to make?

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, let me
come at that from what we did

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that was different
from other films

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.187 align:middle line:84%
on the subject matter is we
chose to focus on the movements,

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
and on the activism more
than the issues per se.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:29.062 align:middle line:84%
And that meant a
much more impassioned

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.731 align:middle line:84%
and a much more engaging
for the audiences.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.933 align:middle line:84%
You can see people
like Lois Gibbs --

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.301 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: -- fighting
really to save their lives,

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.272 align:middle line:84%
and their children,
and their homes.

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think audiences
can identify

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.611 align:middle line:90%
and follow that much better.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:84%
And film's a very
emotional medium.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:48.881 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell:
And often the problem

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:51.517 align:middle line:90%
with environmental films is

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:54.053 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
emotional enough or that --

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.655 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Right; they're
just documenting.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: -- you know,
you're peeling back the layers

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:01.661 align:middle line:84%
of this issue and at the
end you say, "You know,

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.097 align:middle line:90%
hope is a renewable resource.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:05.565 align:middle line:84%
Go out and change
your light bulbs."

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:06.532 align:middle line:90%
And it just felt --

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.567 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:08.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell:
-- insufficient.

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:10.236 align:middle line:90%
So this is -- we thought

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:84%
that this would be much more
involving, and in fact it is.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:15.241 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So why did you
choose to break the film

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.443 align:middle line:90%
down into 5 different acts?

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:18.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, the basic idea came
from one of our advisors,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
E.O. Wilson, who's a very
imminent conservation biologist

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.287 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard, the ant man.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:33.326 align:middle line:84%
And he said we should focus
on 5 of the most dramatic

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:84%
and important events and
people, and try and put

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:41.734 align:middle line:84%
that into something much shorter
and more pity and dramatic.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:46.038 align:middle line:84%
And we were working on a much
longer film at that point.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:49.442 align:middle line:84%
And I realized he was right, and
right there in the Bug Museum

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:52.145 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard we picked
those 5 main stories

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:54.447 align:middle line:90%
which are in the film.

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.149 align:middle line:90%
And then I took that idea --

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:59.385 align:middle line:84%
I had to set it aside for a
few years and work for a living

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.555 align:middle line:84%
and raise a family, but
when I came back to it,

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:06.826 align:middle line:84%
I really built those 5 main
stories out into an act.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:11.531 align:middle line:84%
I realized that each one was
emblematic of a movement,

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.767 align:middle line:84%
a part of the movement and
an era of the movement.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:19.372 align:middle line:84%
And so I eventually came up with
sort of an hourglass structure

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:23.242 align:middle line:84%
in which you start wide with
the origins of pollution,

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:26.012 align:middle line:84%
or alternative ecology
movements,

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:29.048 align:middle line:84%
or international
resource issues.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.684 align:middle line:84%
And then I narrow in
on the main story,

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:35.955 align:middle line:84%
and then after that we open
up to explore ramifications,

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.558 align:middle line:84%
evolution of that
part of the movement.

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:40.827 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to work
well and it seems

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:43.429 align:middle line:84%
that this film can use
a lot of structure,

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:46.833 align:middle line:84%
they can use a guiding
hand from a narrator.

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:51.304 align:middle line:84%
You're going through a lot
of story and a lot of stuff,

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:57.743 align:middle line:84%
and you need -- I think it helps
to have some real structure.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, structure to it.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.347 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Let's take a
look at the first act;

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:06.085 align:middle line:84%
and this pretty much explains
the beginning of the Sierra Club

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.821 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of environmental
movements

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:13.359 align:middle line:90%
that we still have today.

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Saving the land,
nature wild and pure,

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.897 align:middle line:84%
was the main thrust
of conservation.

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:21.834 align:middle line:84%
And the pivotal battles
were over dams.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.536 align:middle line:84%
The first was Hetch
Hetchy Valley

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:24.904 align:middle line:90%
in Yosemite National Park.

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:28.574 align:middle line:84%
San Francisco proposed
to build a reservoir.

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It turned into the
defining struggle

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.715 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation movement,
a clash of 2 pioneers.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
John Muir, preservationist
wanted

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.722 align:middle line:84%
to preserve nature understanding
that the flow of wildness came

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:45.458 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning
of life, that we're part

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.227 align:middle line:84%
of this great scheme
of wilderness,

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:51.898 align:middle line:84%
and we should preserve
it for its sake

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:54.767 align:middle line:90%
and also for our own sake.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other side of this
argument was a fellow named

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.205 align:middle line:84%
Gifford Pinchot, who
has made the first hit

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:90%
of the forest service.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.778 align:middle line:84%
Pinchot's philosophy was that
conservation meant the wise use

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
of resources for
the greatest number

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.682 align:middle line:90%
of people for the longest time.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.885 align:middle line:84%
And then if you had
two Yosemite's,

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.522 align:middle line:84%
it was okay to use one
of them for water supply.

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:21.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Muir railed against what he
called "the temple destroyers,"

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:90%
and fought on for 12 long years.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.132 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Mark, there always
seems to be this debate

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:29.568 align:middle line:84%
between what's going on with
progress and what's going

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.405 align:middle line:84%
on with the needs
of the environment.

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:35.174 align:middle line:84%
And we've been in this
debate for a long time.

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:38.344 align:middle line:84%
Why do you feel -- or how
do you feel that we can move

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:43.215 align:middle line:84%
through that, or meet both
somewhere in the middle?

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: [Laughs]
Well, you're right,

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:48.387 align:middle line:84%
back in the '70s I recall it
was jobs versus the environment,

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.823 align:middle line:84%
and there's always
been that tension

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:56.595 align:middle line:84%
between this thing we call
"progress," and this movement

00:14:56.595 --> 00:15:02.802 align:middle line:84%
which is about trying to halt
the destruction that comes

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:90%
as a byproduct of all

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:09.208 align:middle line:84%
that modern industrial
society and all its progress.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.242 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.177 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Right; and
all the conveniences

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:90%
of it and so forth, yes.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And, you
know, it goes to the heart

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:19.452 align:middle line:84%
of what this civilization is
about in this time of, you know,

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:24.623 align:middle line:84%
we've really mastered the
material world and turned it

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:28.227 align:middle line:84%
to our benefit, and we dominate
this world so completely.

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:29.462 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:30.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: You know,
we're only now getting

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:33.499 align:middle line:84%
around to the deeper
consequences of that

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
and starting to wake up to that.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.405 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always going to
be that tension, and, you know,

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:42.174 align:middle line:84%
you can notice how the

00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:32.711 align:middle line:84%
What made the difference
was the people

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:39.718 align:middle line:84%
of Love Canal, led
by Lois Gibbs.

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.019 align:middle line:90%
>> You are murderers.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:42.121 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of you
in this room are murderers.

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:90%
[ Chanting ]

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.659 align:middle line:84%
>> When Love Canal came it was
a new segment in the movement.

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:50.128 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that we don't
care about the forest,

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:84%
it was the people focus that set
us aside from the other elements

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.971 align:middle line:84%
that had come before
us, and really the focus

00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:04.443 align:middle line:84%
on if the fish are dying,
and if the birds are dying,

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to die.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Buried beneath the
neighborhood were 20,000 tons

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.152 align:middle line:84%
of poisonous chemicals,
dumped in an old canal

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:16.855 align:middle line:90%
by Hooker Chemical Corporation.

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:20.158 align:middle line:84%
Reports of trouble
began in 1976,

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:23.328 align:middle line:84%
but Love Canal did not
explode until Michael Brown,

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:26.865 align:middle line:84%
a journalist at the Niagara
Gazette wrote articles exposing

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.066 align:middle line:90%
the problem.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:30.869 align:middle line:84%
They caught the eye
of Lois Gibbs.

00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:32.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Lois Gibbs: I read
a newspaper article,

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:37.075 align:middle line:84%
and Love Canal had 20,000 tons
of chemicals buried in it,

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:39.845 align:middle line:84%
and that it was leaking
into the neighborhood.

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:43.415 align:middle line:84%
And so I read this newspaper and
I said, "Oh, those poor people."

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.751 align:middle line:84%
The next day there was
another article and in

00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:49.121 align:middle line:84%
that one it talked about the
99th Street Elementary School,

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:53.025 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, "Oh my goodness,

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:55.527 align:middle line:84%
that's where Michael's
going to kindergarten.

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:90%
That's why Michael's so sick."

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Lois tried to get her son
transferred to another school,

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:04.136 align:middle line:90%
but the superintendent refused.

00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Lois Gibbs: And when I
met with Dr. Long he said,

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:10.042 align:middle line:84%
"I am not about to
move 407 children

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:14.913 align:middle line:84%
because of one irate hysterical
housewife with a sickly kid."

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead Lois began

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:19.117 align:middle line:84%
to circulate a petition
to close the school.

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:22.087 align:middle line:84%
She went door to door
discovering the extent

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.455 align:middle line:90%
of the damage.

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Lois Gibbs: I was shocked.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.458 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely shocked.

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:29.328 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was the only
one with a sickly child.

00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:33.098 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was the only
family that was affected

00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:35.867 align:middle line:84%
by these leaking
chemicals from Love Canal.

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.303 align:middle line:90%
In their basement you could see

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.139 align:middle line:84%
where the chemical
residue just comes

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:42.608 align:middle line:90%
up through the basement floor

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:46.078 align:middle line:84%
and just pools there,
and it smells.

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:47.746 align:middle line:84%
It smells like a
chemical factory.

00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:49.615 align:middle line:90%
It's nasty.

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:53.452 align:middle line:90%
>> This wall just popped up

00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:55.654 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we
feel is causing a lot

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of the birth defects
and the miscarriages

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:90%
and health problems in the area.

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:03.996 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: 56% of the children were
born with severe birth defects

00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:06.498 align:middle line:84%
in Love Canal; I
mean, malformations

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:08.233 align:middle line:90%
in their face, hands, legs.

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did the
government justify that,

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:12.104 align:middle line:84%
because I remember there
was a trial, right?

00:26:12.104 --> 00:26:13.905 align:middle line:84%
Well, I saw it in
the documentary.

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:14.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell:
Well, that first came

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.942 align:middle line:84%
out when they did
their own health study.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And as Lois tells it, the New
York State government, you know,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.017 align:middle line:84%
they threw the report on
the floor and stomped on it,

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:27.219 align:middle line:84%
and said it's useless
housewife data.

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:30.555 align:middle line:84%
And then they went and
did their own study.

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:33.458 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with
exactly the same results.

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.993 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Results; wow.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:39.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And then they
said, "But we don't believe

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:43.702 align:middle line:84%
that that's a result of the
chemicals of Love Canal.

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:47.105 align:middle line:84%
We believe that it's
a random cluster

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:49.841 align:middle line:84%
of genetically defective
people."

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: People; in an area.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:54.246 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Unrelated.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:56.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: So they
blamed it on the people

00:26:56.415 --> 00:27:00.152 align:middle line:84%
and on random -- and there was
obvious self-interest there

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
because if they dealt
with it there

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.589 align:middle line:84%
at Love Canal there were
56 other places in New York

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:08.093 align:middle line:84%
that they had to deal
with; and so any excuse.

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.428 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So what wound
up happening?

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Why do you call her
"the heroine?"

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well,
she just pursued it

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.568 align:middle line:90%
for 2 years in everything --

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:17.836 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Relentlessly.

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: "Relentless,"
there's the word for it.

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:23.809 align:middle line:84%
And they forced the federal
government, the EPA, to come in.

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:27.979 align:middle line:84%
They forced the state of New
York to deal with the issue.

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.481 align:middle line:90%
They forced it, forced it,

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:84%
forced it until finally
the EPA did a study

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:90%
that showed chromosome damage.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.557 align:middle line:84%
And when it got to
that level, you know,

00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:41.593 align:middle line:84%
the EPA recommended getting
everybody out of there.

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And Carter overruled them.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.066 align:middle line:84%
President Carter
overruled the EPA.

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:52.537 align:middle line:84%
But then what they did was they
took the EPA officials hostage

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:84%
and they forced Jimmy Carter to
basically deal with the problem.

00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:59.711 align:middle line:90%
And 2 days later he cried uncle.

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.847 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Lois Gibbs did this,
she took them hostage.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:04.549 align:middle line:84%
Now, this could not
work in today's times.

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The petition is -- it's
fairly effective anymore

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.156 align:middle line:84%
because we used to see
these people go door to door

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:12.824 align:middle line:84%
into a government
that would listen.

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:16.828 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's not so much
the same these days.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: I
don't agree, Lisa.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, good; good.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:21.032 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, my
wife is one of the leaders

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:90%
of Occupy in San Francisco.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.472 align:middle line:90%
I'm around lots of movements.

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:30.709 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing what Bill
McKibben is doing with 350.

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:34.513 align:middle line:84%
There's been in the last couple
years a real upsurge in activism

00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:84%
around these issues, and it's
taken 25 years to finally take

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.255 align:middle line:84%
on climate as an issue at the
grassroots at a movement level.

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I see a lot of
people pushing on it.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.227 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the hardest
issue to take on at that level

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.629 align:middle line:90%
that there's ever been.

00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:84%
But people are finding
a way to do it,

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:54.065 align:middle line:90%
and it's because we have to.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.001 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, what are some
of the effective ways,

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:57.903 align:middle line:84%
because I know I'm not
the only person that feels

00:28:57.903 --> 00:28:59.604 align:middle line:90%
that it is a challenge.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:02.607 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see
over the course

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:90%
of 350.org the McKibben family.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.579 align:middle line:84%
You know, McKibben wrote
the first copyright article

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:11.583 align:middle line:90%
in '88 about this.

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And he waited around
and nobody did anything.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.057 align:middle line:84%
And he waited around some
more and nobody did anything.

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:23.461 align:middle line:84%
And he finally just got
fed up, and with 6 students

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:28.233 align:middle line:84%
from his class at Middlebury
College they put together --

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:31.002 align:middle line:84%
it was first called
"Step It Up."

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:34.673 align:middle line:84%
And it happened locally in
Vermont, and then they decided

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:36.074 align:middle line:90%
to go national with it.

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:84%
And they -- you know, the time
was right after all those years

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:44.616 align:middle line:84%
of Bush, Junior, they -- people
really needed to step it up.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.452 align:middle line:84%
And it caught on like
wildfire, and they --

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:48.687 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And the --

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: -- you
know, they would do sit-ins

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:53.592 align:middle line:84%
on the courthouse steps, and
they would do photographs,

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:56.728 align:middle line:84%
and they would do photographs
all over the world, in every --

00:29:56.728 --> 00:30:00.065 align:middle line:84%
all over the world people wanted
to be involved and do something,

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:02.367 align:middle line:90%
and they sort of built on that.

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.835 align:middle line:90%
And you know --

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.638 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What did 350.org,
what does it stand for?

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:09.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, it
refers to the parts per million

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:14.646 align:middle line:84%
of carbon dioxide that is
considered the safe level,

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:17.515 align:middle line:90%
and anything beyond 350,

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:21.086 align:middle line:84%
which we're 25 years
beyond 35 parts per million,

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:24.055 align:middle line:84%
we're now at 400
and climbing fast.

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:28.894 align:middle line:84%
And we may hit 800 before
this thing gets dealt with.

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:32.063 align:middle line:84%
You know, we may triple the
amount of carbon dioxide

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:35.367 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere before
we can finally get the --

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:36.768 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Attention.

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: -- social and
political wheel to deal with it.

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:41.573 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going to lead
the world in on this one.

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:44.442 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, this is how
these particular movements

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:45.644 align:middle line:90%
are started.

00:30:45.644 --> 00:30:47.145 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a look here
now at this next clip.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.714 align:middle line:84%
And this is how Green
Peace was started.

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.388 align:middle line:84%
>> We're coming upon a
floating slaughterhouse.

in a small boat in front

for their life.

And every time the
harpooner tried to get a shot,

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.952 align:middle line:84%
I was at the helm so I would
maneuver the boat to try

00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:29.654 align:middle line:90%
and block the harpoon.

not shooting,

he knows, this guy is going

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.976 align:middle line:90%
to shoot this harpoon.

smiled and brought his finger

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:40.158 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what happened,
he was waiting for them

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.027 align:middle line:84%
and very nonchalantly
pulled the trigger

00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:43.895 align:middle line:84%
and sent a second harpoon
into the head of the whale,

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:46.164 align:middle line:84%

back, and now the water's full

roll in agony on the surface

sort of beyond emotional.

You know when you -- there
are certain moments that are

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:20.498 align:middle line:84%

>> Why were the Russians
killing these whales?

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.637 align:middle line:84%
You know, they didn't
eat sperm whale meat,

00:33:25.637 --> 00:33:27.305 align:middle line:84%
but they did use a
spermaceti oil [phonetic]

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:31.309 align:middle line:84%
to make high heat-resistant
lubricating oil for machinery.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.344 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pieces of
machinery that they used it

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.579 align:middle line:90%
in is the manufacturer

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.514 align:middle line:84%
of Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles.

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:38.683 align:middle line:84%

destroying this incredibly

of making a weapon meant for the
mass destruction of humanity."

And that's when it came
to me with a, you know,

00:33:47.092 --> 00:33:49.027 align:middle line:90%
like a flash that we're insane.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:50.628 align:middle line:90%
We're just totally insane.

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:54.032 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment on I
decided that I work for whales,

I work for seals, I work for sea
turtles and fish, and seabirds.

>> LG: We were facing extinction

of these incredibly magnificent
animals, and for someone to go

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:84%
out and singlehandedly
start a movement

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:33.738 align:middle line:84%
that stopped every
Russian ship in --

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:36.741 align:middle line:84%
and whaling altogether
in that particular period

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:37.876 align:middle line:90%
of history is enormous.

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:38.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.744 align:middle line:90%

Well, it takes somebody
like that.

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.626 align:middle line:84%
So eventually something
wound up happening to him

00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:56.327 align:middle line:90%
where he was no longer a part

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.296 align:middle line:84%
of the Green Peace
Movement though, right?

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:00.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes;
well there was a split

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:02.534 align:middle line:84%
where he was kicked
out of Green Peace.

00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:03.668 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Why?

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:04.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: For
breaching their ethic

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:07.705 align:middle line:84%
of nonviolence was
the main reason.

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:11.176 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of politics
and the power succession,

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:14.913 align:middle line:84%
what do you call it, a power
struggle or succession going

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:17.182 align:middle line:84%
in within the movement
there too.

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:20.318 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, after the whale
campaign they did the seal

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:22.287 align:middle line:84%
campaigns, and that
was Paul's idea.

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:26.758 align:middle line:84%
And the first year they came
under enormous pressure not

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:32.263 align:middle line:84%
to interfere with the,
you know, sealers.

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:35.934 align:middle line:84%
And Paul wanted to
spray paint the pelt

00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:38.403 align:middle line:90%
so that the seal comes --

00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:39.704 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Weren't effective; right.

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:40.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell:
-- [overlapping].

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And
they gave in on that.

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:46.244 align:middle line:84%
And Paul came back the next
year just absolutely determined.

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:50.682 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, he took a
sealers club and threw it

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:84%
in the open water, and he
chained himself to the pelts.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.087 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they threw
him out, was they felt

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:58.189 align:middle line:90%
that he'd gone too far.

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:03.061 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, there was
a bigger split going on,

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:09.133 align:middle line:84%
and Paul -- you know, Rex
Wyler in that clip he --

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:11.803 align:middle line:84%
the next thing he talks
about is how it was

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:13.905 align:middle line:90%
like an amoeba splitting.

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:18.109 align:middle line:84%
And everybody went on and
grew and followed their paths

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:20.111 align:middle line:84%
and it was in the
end much better.

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.479 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
kinds of arguments

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:22.814 align:middle line:90%
that will go on in a movement.

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:27.385 align:middle line:84%
And in the end it's often
healthiest for people to split.

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:30.021 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's interesting though,
kind of tracks how that happens

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.823 align:middle line:84%
within a major movement
like this.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:33.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes, yes.

00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:35.994 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And to -- because
we're facing a major movement,

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:38.429 align:middle line:84%
which you cover at the
end of this film here,

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:42.233 align:middle line:84%
with global warming and with
our environmental issues.

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:45.203 align:middle line:84%
So it's very helpful to
track what has happened,

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
what's been effective, how
the politics get involved.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.578 align:middle line:84%
And the challenges; I mean,
the politics are as fierce

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.614 align:middle line:84%
as the movements
themselves, and the danger

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
that these people put
themselves in is enormous.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:36:59.851 align:middle line:90%
And it still is today.

00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:01.152 align:middle line:84%
They're threatened
every single day.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.955 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's not
fierce enough, Lisa.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:08.026 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we do quicktivism
[phonetic], and write checks,

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:12.864 align:middle line:84%
and don't get out there and put
our bodies between the harpoons.

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:14.866 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's what I was
talking about with the petition,

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.868 align:middle line:84%
going door to door
and standing -- yes.

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:18.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Oh, yes, yes.

00:37:18.136 --> 00:37:20.471 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now it's click to
petition -- click to vote, yes.

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes, yes.

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It's a little
more passive.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: And a lot

00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of these issues are
really hard to address.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.046 align:middle line:84%
You can't put your body
in front of something

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:29.981 align:middle line:90%

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.417 align:middle line:90%

00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:36.054 align:middle line:84%

here talks about deforestation

00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:38.156 align:middle line:84%
and the stories that
you found here.

00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:39.824 align:middle line:84%
Now, I love the fact
that you made this more

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:42.126 align:middle line:84%
than just a historical
documentary.

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:45.163 align:middle line:84%
You brought in characters
here, stories,

00:37:45.163 --> 00:37:46.764 align:middle line:84%
because stories make
a difference.

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.965 align:middle line:90%
Why did you choose to do that?

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.801 align:middle line:90%
Was that intentional?

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:50.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Oh, sure,

00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:51.936 align:middle line:84%
that was my breathe
[phonetic], you know.

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:53.271 align:middle line:90%

And the Brazilian government
sort of saw that it had

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:48.906 align:middle line:84%
to do something, and they
created this whole program

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:54.478 align:middle line:84%

about in the film was
the first of them.

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:16.934 align:middle line:84%
And altogether they saved
about a third of the Amazon,

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.803 align:middle line:90%
and maybe as much as 40%

00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:22.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Brazilian Amazon
was set aside in reserves.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:29.146 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Chico was clearly
the pivotal point in that.

But then there's always,
you know, flip the picture

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:38.255 align:middle line:84%

because once you start

00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:37.995 align:middle line:84%
the tree-huggers, these women
who were, you know, went out

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and hugged the trees to
stop them from being cut

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.366 align:middle line:90%
down for cricket paths.

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And it worked.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: And it worked.

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.336 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And it did work, yes.

00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:48.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And, you
know, India's still losing trees

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:55.045 align:middle line:84%
in Himalayas for floods and
dams, and, you know, but,

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:58.415 align:middle line:84%
you know, we had something
in there about Bolivia

00:46:58.415 --> 00:47:02.853 align:middle line:84%
and the fight to regain
control over their water,

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:07.458 align:middle line:84%
which had been taken away, you
know, as part of a debt crisis.

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:08.993 align:middle line:90%
And we had to cut that out.

00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:09.693 align:middle line:90%
And we just, you know.

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:11.328 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow, wow.

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.531 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look at
what is in the film right now.

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the act 5, which
really addresses the mother

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.137 align:middle line:84%
of all movements, which is
the climate change movement.

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:22.806 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:28.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Disasters brought back
the issue of climate change.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:32.182 align:middle line:84%
Hurricane Katrina was a wakeup
call that revealed the impacts

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:36.754 align:middle line:84%
of global warming in ways that
had not touched people before.

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:40.291 align:middle line:84%
In Europe a heat
wave killed 70,000.

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:42.359 align:middle line:84%
Drought and fire
turned Australia

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:46.263 align:middle line:84%
and the American
Southwest into infernos;

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:50.868 align:middle line:84%
arctic ice disappearing,
coral reefs bleaching.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:54.104 align:middle line:84%
Everything was happening faster
than scientists predicted.

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:58.008 align:middle line:84%
>> I am technologically
optimistic

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.176 align:middle line:90%
that we could prevent a lot

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:03.247 align:middle line:84%
of dangerous outcomes,
not all, but many.

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:05.516 align:middle line:84%
But I'm kind of politically
bleak that we're going to do it

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:08.085 align:middle line:84%
until we have enough
tangle damage

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that the [inaudible]
is able to tip us

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.858 align:middle line:84%
over the political tipping
point of long-term action.

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:18.095 align:middle line:84%
And we got close in '88,
maybe a little bit in Katrina,

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.998 align:middle line:84%
and then we faded
away each time.

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:24.068 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know, do we have to
have a hurricane take out Miami

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:26.637 align:middle line:84%
and Shanghai to have
everybody wake up?

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:30.407 align:middle line:84%
If that happens in 2025 by
then it's going to be too late

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.409 align:middle line:84%
to prevent, you know,
melting of Greenland.

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.878 align:middle line:84%
If it happened next year
it might be possible

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.213 align:middle line:90%
to still do that.

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.449 align:middle line:84%
But what a hell of a
way to run a planet.

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:41.151 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, all the
poling data showing

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:43.253 align:middle line:84%
that Americans understood
what was going on

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and what the danger was,
but still nothing happening

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.859 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, not a damn thing.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:51.729 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're 20 years
without any legislation

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:55.366 align:middle line:84%
that would have done anything
to deal with the biggest problem

00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:56.767 align:middle line:90%
that the world's ever faced.

00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:00.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Our movement was
failing miserably

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:04.575 align:middle line:84%
to create the movement,
the pressure the awareness

00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:08.645 align:middle line:84%
in the public to make
something happen.

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:14.184 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.753 align:middle line:90%
>> I started emailing people

00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:17.554 align:middle line:84%
to say we're going
to go for a walk.

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:20.457 align:middle line:84%
We left from Robert Frost
old cabin because we liked

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:23.794 align:middle line:84%
that most clichéd of all poems
about the road not taken.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.597 align:middle line:84%
>> And that emerged
into the global campaign

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:28.665 align:middle line:84%
on climate action
for the Tick, Tick,

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:31.201 align:middle line:90%
Tick Campaign as it's known.

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:36.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we've moved on to do the
global version of this, 350.org,

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:38.542 align:middle line:84%
in reference to Jim
Hansen's number,

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:41.278 align:middle line:90%
this red line for the planet.

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:45.416 align:middle line:84%
>> "350" refers to parts per
million of carbon dioxide

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:50.587 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere, the number
considered safe by scientists.

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:53.023 align:middle line:90%
It was surpassed in 1988,

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the year Hansen first
issued his warning.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.862 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In the movie you did talk
about the fact that there are

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:03.333 align:middle line:84%
over 2 million environmental
organizations currently.

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.836 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is a
part of the solution,

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.704 align:middle line:90%
or a part of the problem,

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:11.642 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
all joined together.

00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:13.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: [Laughs] Well,

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:84%
in some happy day we'll all be
together, but I think it's one

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:18.615 align:middle line:84%
of the movement's strengths is
that there's so much diversity,

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:20.884 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
local and national

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.352 align:middle line:90%
and international groups.

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:27.458 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it's -- you
know, we talk a lot in the film

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:33.697 align:middle line:84%
about bottom up movements
versus top down politics,

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and I really think
you need both.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.037 align:middle line:84%
And you need the bottom to be
putting the pressure on the top.

00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:44.374 align:middle line:90%
And the movement is episodic,

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:47.111 align:middle line:84%
and it needs fresh
bursts of energy.

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And it needs people
to come along

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.284 align:middle line:84%
when earlier groups have
sort of lost their way

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.286 align:middle line:90%
and become ineffective.

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I like to think about how
whenever the movement threatens

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to become irrelevant, it's
the issues that bring it back.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.661 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes; well that's --

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:05.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And
there's been that pattern.

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.397 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that's why we
see -- I even asked --

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:10.067 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question simply
because I think it's a new --

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.303 align:middle line:84%
incredible thing that
there's 2 million movements

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:16.673 align:middle line:84%
with that many people engaged
in this one issue that has to do

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.909 align:middle line:90%
with us and our future.

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.444 align:middle line:84%
Now, where have you
been showing the film?

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:22.146 align:middle line:84%
I think this film would
be great if it's shown

00:51:22.146 --> 00:51:25.315 align:middle line:84%
in every educational
environment there is, schools,

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.517 align:middle line:90%
those types of settings.

00:51:26.517 --> 00:51:28.752 align:middle line:84%
Where have you been
showing it up to this point?

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well, it
premiered at Sundance a year

00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:35.659 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago, and in that
time we've done 50, 60,

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.628 align:middle line:90%
70 festivals all over the world.

00:51:37.628 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up this week
in Iceland, Malaysia,

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:45.836 align:middle line:84%
and there's one other place that
I'm leaving out; forgive me.

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:48.839 align:middle line:84%
We did a theatrical
release of about 40 cities.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:54.077 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we launched
educational distribution,

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:57.581 align:middle line:84%
and we zoomed past
$50,000 in business.

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:02.186 align:middle line:84%
And we're just -- it's living up
to what I thought it would be,

00:52:02.186 --> 00:52:05.389 align:middle line:84%
which is sort of the documentary
of record that everybody's going

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:10.761 align:middle line:84%
to use, and show, and teach
our children, and so on.

00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:15.332 align:middle line:84%
And I decided in May that
we just hadn't done justice

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:18.268 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of places, and
that this film was really a

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:21.305 align:middle line:84%
grassroots film, and we
needed to get out there

00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.073 align:middle line:90%
and do our own distribution.

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.875 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
organizing [inaudible].

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:28.946 align:middle line:84%
And we got another
200 screenings coming

00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:31.014 align:middle line:90%
up in the next couple months.

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:35.786 align:middle line:84%
I'm in LA to do 8 showings
in 9 days, and then I'm off

00:52:35.786 --> 00:52:37.688 align:middle line:90%
to the Northwest in November,

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:39.623 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
do the deep South.

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.858 align:middle line:84%
We're going to really
go through there.

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.027 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it makes sense,
these movements were based

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.128 align:middle line:90%
on grassroots movements.

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.597 align:middle line:90%
Why not distribute the film

00:52:46.597 --> 00:52:48.332 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, in
the same pattern?

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:48.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Yes.

00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:50.067 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:52:50.067 --> 00:52:51.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: And
it's really exciting to be

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.836 align:middle line:84%
at this point where now it's
going to be available widely

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:55.072 align:middle line:90%
to the public at large.

00:52:55.072 --> 00:52:58.308 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
really should take off.

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.644 align:middle line:84%
And all the work we've
been doing trying

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:04.514 align:middle line:84%
to build it is really
supposed to pay off now.

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: How do people get a
hold of the film, if they want

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.218 align:middle line:84%
to show it in their
schools and so forth?

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark Kitchell: Well,
it's -- as of October 1st,

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:13.523 align:middle line:84%
it's available at all
your favorite platforms,

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:17.527 align:middle line:84%
whether it's iTunes,
Amazon, Netflix,

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:19.463 align:middle line:90%
Gaiam, just on, you know.

00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:21.698 align:middle line:84%
Name a platform, it
will be there for you.

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:22.833 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great, great, terrific.

00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:23.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Mark Kitchell: Okay.

00:53:23.634 --> 00:53:24.601 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: All right, all right.

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.336 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at this ending,

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:29.239 align:middle line:84%
which kind of puts
everything together in a way

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:32.075 align:middle line:84%
that we can understand
and take action.

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> If we haven't learned yet,
then we should get it now,

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.814 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
going to be top down.

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It goes right back to hundreds
of millions of people on earth

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:49.726 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to
find, and craft,

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:54.698 align:middle line:84%
and create solutions
every single day.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:57.968 align:middle line:84%
>> The very word "movement"
I think is too small

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.770 align:middle line:90%
to describe it.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.707 align:middle line:84%
No one started this world view,
no one is in charge of it,

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:07.210 align:middle line:84%
there is no orthodoxy,
it is global, classless,

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.046 align:middle line:90%
unquenchable, and tireless.

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:14.685 align:middle line:84%

the "Fierce Green Future."

couldn't make a big ending.

I had plans, and we
tried a few of them.

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.885 align:middle line:84%
So I just figure I'll
make another film.

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.721 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about
that larger vision

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.924 align:middle line:84%
of civilizational
transformation.

00:58:13.924 --> 00:58:18.194 align:middle line:84%
I see this change is as big
as the Industrial Revolution.

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And the next step it's the
sustainable revolution.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.833 align:middle line:84%
It's learning how to bring
our industrial society

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:26.403 align:middle line:84%
into sustainable balance
for the natural world

00:58:26.403 --> 00:58:29.005 align:middle line:90%
on which we depend for survival.

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.942 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a lot
of solutions and a lot

00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:33.877 align:middle line:84%
of movements, and
a lot of things

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:36.012 align:middle line:84%
that we really ought
to be looking at.

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:39.215 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to take that
same framework and go future.

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:41.151 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I love it, "A
Fierce Green Future,"

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:42.452 align:middle line:90%
