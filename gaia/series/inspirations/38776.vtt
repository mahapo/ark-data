>> Lisa Garr: Hi.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.446 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.982 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been aware
of your sixth sense,

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:20.487 align:middle line:84%
or you call it intuition,
or you call it just weird?

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.056 align:middle line:90%
Do you tend to be sensitive?

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.992 align:middle line:84%
Well, would you like to find
out some real practical tips

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:29.462 align:middle line:84%
to be able to handle that
extrasensory awareness

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.932 align:middle line:84%
so that you're not
bombarded by energies all day

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.801 align:middle line:84%
so that you can function
in life?

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is spiritual
teacher Sonia Choquette.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.508 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of over 19
international best-selling books

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.611 align:middle line:84%
on intuitive healing
and personal growth.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.179 align:middle line:84%
Welcome. Thank you
for being here.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:46.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Sonia Choquette:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.481 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm so glad
that you're here.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: [Laughter].

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So how long
have you been teaching?

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.053 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been teaching
workshops for a long time.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.188 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, my
very first workshop was

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.924 align:middle line:90%
over 40 years ago.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 40?

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I was a kid,
but I've always had intuition.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:09.402 align:middle line:84%
It's always been in
the bones of my life.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.205 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it's like not to,

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:16.776 align:middle line:84%
but I started doing intuitive
readings for people and realized

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.678 align:middle line:90%
that they had been disconnected.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the worst
handicap you could have.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And so what do you mean

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.616 align:middle line:84%
that you always have
had intuition?

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.285 align:middle line:84%
How did you know
it was intuition,

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:28.521 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't just weird or
scary or something freaky?

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, in my world,
it was never weird or scary

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.892 align:middle line:90%
because I grew up in a family

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.728 align:middle line:84%
where intuition was central
to our consciousness.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:40.033 align:middle line:84%
My mother would always
ask us to trust our vibes,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.936 align:middle line:84%
and what are we feeling,
because it was something

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.538 align:middle line:84%
that was very paramount
to her life.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:51.711 align:middle line:84%
And so she created that for us,
and being one of seven kids,

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.946 align:middle line:90%
I was very competitive.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.215 align:middle line:84%
I wanted my mother's
attention, so I get really good

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.184 align:middle line:84%
at my vibes, and that
was one of the ways...

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...that I
was -- it was our game.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.322 align:middle line:90%
Who is on the phone?

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.356 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going to park?

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.858 align:middle line:90%
Where can we go find our picnic?

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.392 align:middle line:90%
Where are my keys?

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.429 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
way we lived.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.564 align:middle line:90%
When I started school,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:16.769 align:middle line:84%
I realized other people had
somehow become disconnected

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.772 align:middle line:90%
and to me, that was scary.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They didn't
live that way.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: No.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.011 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like being
completely lost in the dark.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.714 align:middle line:84%
How could you live without
your intuition guiding you?

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.317 align:middle line:84%
That would be like being in the
jungle at night with no light.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:90%
It would be crazy scary.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But yet how does that
show up in people's lives,

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.756 align:middle line:90%
living without their intuition?

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.692 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, they
get very tuned in to fear.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.561 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine,
for example, Lisa.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.229 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
in a blackout?

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: All of a sudden,
your whole body goes, uh!

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: You know.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: And you're scared.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And so everything
becomes very threatening...

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...because you
don't know what's out there.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.476 align:middle line:84%
But when you have intuition,
it's like turning on the lights.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:01.147 align:middle line:84%
It's like giving you a sense of
your path, of the connections

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
of the way in which you are
in relationship to the world.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Why do you
think we lose that?

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.556 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of us as kids
maybe do have that feeling,

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.058 align:middle line:84%
but we're not identifying
it as clearly

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
as you had it identified.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.962 align:middle line:90%
But where do we lose it?

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: We are all
born with a sixth sense

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.832 align:middle line:90%
because it's your heart.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.736 align:middle line:84%
It is the first organ
in your body to develop,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.507 align:middle line:84%
way before your brain, way
before your other senses.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.577 align:middle line:84%
The second organ to develop
in your body is the cochlear,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the inner ear, and
those two pick up energy

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and vibration, and
that informs us.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
People don't know this but every
one of your physical senses goes

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.656 align:middle line:90%
through the ear into the heart,

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:48.061 align:middle line:84%
so your heart is your
guidance system, and we lose it

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.896 align:middle line:90%
because we are conditioned --

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.667 align:middle line:84%
the majority of the planet
has been conditioned to ignore

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.071 align:middle line:84%
that inner wisdom, but
we all start out with it.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's interesting
because you think

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:90%
about a baby in a womb.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They can pick up the
feelings of the mother.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Very much so.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And they
are hearing everything.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
We are very conscious, and your
heart is a very intelligent,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.989 align:middle line:90%
very informing organ.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did
intuition guide you

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.427 align:middle line:90%
on your most recent pilgrimage?

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:25.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, I'd
been married very young

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.601 align:middle line:84%
to the same man, and we
had two beautiful kids,

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.704 align:middle line:84%
but our relationship was
always a very challenged one.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did you
-- how old were you?

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I was 22 when
I got married, and we're both

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.278 align:middle line:90%
from large Catholic families.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.814 align:middle line:84%
He was the oldest of
his Catholic clan;

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.417 align:middle line:84%
I was the middle child with
a lot of older brothers,

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:48.488 align:middle line:84%
so Patrick and I had a
lot of combative moments.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.556 align:middle line:84%
And I just hung in
there and hung in there,

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.759 align:middle line:84%
and finally we just
reached gridlock,

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.863 align:middle line:90%
and two years ago we separated,

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.365 align:middle line:84%
and it was quite
shattering to me.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, after 28 years.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah,
and it was hard

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:08.107 align:middle line:84%
because as a spiritual
teacher and as an intuitive,

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:12.679 align:middle line:84%
this wasn't supposed to happen
to me, and yet I came to realize

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.816 align:middle line:84%
that I'm also human, and I
have the same human experiences

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.251 align:middle line:90%
as everyone else.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:22.855 align:middle line:84%
My intuition -- and I was
just such in such grief

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and such confusion -- my
intuition one day just said,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.031 align:middle line:84%
walk the Camino, which is
a pilgrimage across Spain.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an 840 kilometer
pilgrimage by foot.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.205 align:middle line:90%
And it made no sense.

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
It invited me to walk
away from my life,

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.243 align:middle line:84%
unplug from all my
responsibilities,

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:48.381 align:middle line:84%
just let everything
go, shut it down,

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:52.652 align:middle line:84%
and knowing my intuition is
so reliable, I said okay.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:56.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: To go on a 550
mile walk across Spain...

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:57.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: By myself.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:58.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...a couple months ago.

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yes,
I went in May,

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.296 align:middle line:84%
and when I went,
it was May-June.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.732 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be
warm, this is nice.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.935 align:middle line:84%
The very second day that
I was there, it snowed.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In May?

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: In May,
and it was freezing.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:19.312 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a woman who went the
day after me died from the cold.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It was really intense.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah,
a Canadian woman.

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
It was very sad.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.552 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture here
of you at the beginning.

00:06:27.552 --> 00:06:29.188 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the
first day [laughter].

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.423 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Just
happy to go up and...

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So did you
camp, backpack?

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.162 align:middle line:90%
How does...

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I backpacked,
but I didn't camp.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.568 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in hostels that are
just positioned along the way,

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.537 align:middle line:84%
and you just follow
these yellow arrows,

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:49.308 align:middle line:84%
and it went over two mountain
ranges across a huge expanse

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:52.111 align:middle line:84%
of plains where just
long, long --

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.615 align:middle line:84%
all you did was walk,
think, pray.

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:56.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Listen.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Listen.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: In the hostels you
stayed at, were they accustomed

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.855 align:middle line:84%
to having pilgrimage
people walk in?

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Right, everybody
who comes are pilgrims,

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.661 align:middle line:84%
so people were prepared and
they were mostly very loving

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.331 align:middle line:84%
and gracious, and
you're just exhausted.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.101 align:middle line:84%
You get in, and here was
an interesting thing.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.138 align:middle line:84%
You eat dinner around 8, 8:30 in
Spain, but I'd arrive around 5,

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:21.174 align:middle line:84%
and I'd pass out until
the next morning.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.241 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted...

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:23.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wow.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...for the
first couple weeks at least,

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:26.778 align:middle line:90%
almost 2 1/2 weeks I'd just...

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:28.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How many miles
a day did you walk?

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:31.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, I
walked 30 kilometers,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.352 align:middle line:90%
which is about 22 miles.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: A day?

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:37.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: But it was up
and down and up and down.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.859 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was hard.

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't how I made it.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You almost
walked a marathon a day.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:47.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yes, pretty much,
a marathon a day for 33 days.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:50.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And did
your feet get sore?

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:50.736 align:middle line:90%
Did you get blisters?

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Destroyed.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Destroyed.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:57.243 align:middle line:84%
I never got a blister, but
I ruined all of my toenails.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:59.378 align:middle line:90%
I got what's called boot bang,

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.848 align:middle line:84%
which is when your toes hit the
front of your boots going down,

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:05.952 align:middle line:84%
so on day 3, I had
trashed all my toenails,

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.054 align:middle line:90%
and I was in so much pain.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:13.326 align:middle line:84%
And then I got nerve damage
on my arches of my feet.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.294 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, crawling.

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why did you continue?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.865 align:middle line:90%
What inspired you to?

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:19.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: My spirit.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:24.203 align:middle line:90%
I had to. I had to continue

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:29.375 align:middle line:84%
because for whatever was hurting
my feet, my heart was healing.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:33.613 align:middle line:84%
My past was dropping
off like barnacles,

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:38.484 align:middle line:84%
and I was learning the power of
listening and honoring my spirit

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:42.955 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to see
everything with such compassion

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:47.994 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness that
I didn't want to stop.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.663 align:middle line:84%
You just wanted to find out
what the next day brought,

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.664 align:middle line:90%
and the next day?

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I would--
I never knew.

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:57.236 align:middle line:84%
It brought up things clear
from my past lives, guides.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:09:00.172 align:middle line:84%
I'd suffered -- before
my marriage broke up,

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.975 align:middle line:90%
my brother died in his sleep.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.243 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly fine.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:06.512 align:middle line:84%
He had artery in his
heart or something,

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:09.282 align:middle line:84%
and the shock killed my
father six weeks later.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So it was first
my brother, then my father.

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.954 align:middle line:84%
That threw me, and
then my marriage.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:16.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So I
was pretty shattered.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: And...

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:23.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...and confused,
and I just wanted to heal.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to be
connected to my spirit.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.036 align:middle line:90%
I was listening to my guides.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:36.542 align:middle line:84%
I was healing my grief,
and I was healing my karma.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.977 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty wild.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:39.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well, you got --

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.948 align:middle line:84%
the message was sent up to the
universe, because then you woke

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:84%
up the next day to snow, and
-- well, these are actually --

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
this is a picture here that we
have of the beautiful woods.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.487 align:middle line:90%
Is this the path?

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:49.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: That
was part of the path,

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:90%
and it was very mystical.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, when -- the
Camino is like stepping

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.563 align:middle line:90%
out of ordinary time and space.

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:58.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Into another time.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Into another
dimension, another frequency.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Really?

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Thousands of
year's people walking this path

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:10.209 align:middle line:84%
in prayer creates a
vibration that is so --

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.278 align:middle line:90%
it's like clear mirror.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, so it's
not a regular walk?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: No, it's not.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.484 align:middle line:90%
It's not. It was -- in fact,

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.353 align:middle line:84%
this is a quick story I
want to share with you.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:23.389 align:middle line:84%
I had a troubled
relationship with my father.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:27.426 align:middle line:84%
It was not necessarily a
good one when I was young,

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:32.698 align:middle line:84%
and just crazy, but I forgive
my father and had compassion.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.668 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the trip one day,

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:39.005 align:middle line:84%
I have these walking gloves,
and I woke, and my father used

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:42.208 align:middle line:84%
to always flip me pennies,
and he would say, "Remember.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.609 align:middle line:90%
In God we trust."

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:47.513 align:middle line:84%
That was just one of my father's
things, and one day I woke up

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:51.984 align:middle line:90%
and on my gloves was a penny.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Just magically.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:53.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: He was...

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wow, he was
right there with you.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: ...right there.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:03.195 align:middle line:84%
He was right there, as one
of many of the magical,

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:08.868 align:middle line:84%
out-of-this-world, not of the
third dimension experiences,

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.203 align:middle line:84%
and it was very fluent
and on the Camino.

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:14.807 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension, the fourth,
the fifth dimension, the spirit.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:19.645 align:middle line:84%
It was all very fluent, so
you've walked in a lot of grace.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:22.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And in your state of
silence, was it better for you

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:26.185 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the words and
the busyness and the thoughts

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.187 align:middle line:84%
and the texting and the
phones, and all of that?

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I had
to do that, Lisa.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.323 align:middle line:84%
My world has always
been talking,

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:90%
guiding, teaching, writing.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.298 align:middle line:84%
I needed to unplug from all
of that, and just listen.

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:42.635 align:middle line:84%
There was a day I walked
where the birds were so loud,

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:47.239 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was being sung
to by birds for eight hours.

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:48.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: [Laughter] Wow.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And it was
like, you guys are loud.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.745 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing, you know.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:56.282 align:middle line:90%
It's just a crazy experience.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's so neat, though.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: It was so great.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because, I mean they're
probably always that loud,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:03.456 align:middle line:84%
but we just have so much
noise that overrides them.

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:04.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Exactly, exactly.

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:06.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: If it's out --

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
extraneous noise or the
noise in our own head.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Between the two,

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.997 align:middle line:84%
but I walked long
enough, it both got quiet.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Beautiful.

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.334 align:middle line:84%
So then you woke up to
this early morning frost.

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:17.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: That was snow,

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.372 align:middle line:84%
and you know the interesting
thing is it had been raining,

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:25.544 align:middle line:84%
turned to snow, so the walk
was mud, and it went clear

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.847 align:middle line:90%
up to my, you know, shins.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:30.249 align:middle line:90%
My feet were in mud and muck,

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.918 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't just
mud like slush.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.153 align:middle line:90%
It was like clay mud.

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Heavy.

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:36.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So I
would put my feet in

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:41.527 align:middle line:84%
and it would suck my boots off,
and it was just ridiculous.

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:45.664 align:middle line:84%
It was just ridiculous, and
I fell in it up to my...

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:46.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my God.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: It was just silly.

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:51.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you meet -- did
you find anyone out there?

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well,
people walked.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.041 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some days I
walked I didn't see a soul.

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:57.776 align:middle line:84%
A lot of days I didn't
see a soul.

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:00.379 align:middle line:90%
A lot of days I saw people,

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:04.817 align:middle line:84%
and we would acknowledge one
another, but it's understood

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:08.087 align:middle line:84%
that you generally
are pretty private.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.255 align:middle line:90%
I saw the world.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.924 align:middle line:84%
There's every nation
is on there.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:13.192 align:middle line:90%
I saw the world.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:15.728 align:middle line:84%
Australia to New Zealand,
Thailand, Japanese,

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:20.232 align:middle line:90%
Argentineans, French, Mexicans.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.234 align:middle line:90%
Every country.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:23.335 align:middle line:90%
Canadians.

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:26.238 align:middle line:84%
Every country, so I
walked with the world.

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did -- well, I wanted
to show people the path.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:32.978 align:middle line:84%
So it just goes on
forever, right?

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:33.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: It seemed like it.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:36.248 align:middle line:84%
There were days when
that it's like,

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:38.017 align:middle line:84%
why am I doing this
is [laughter]?

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:38.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Were there?

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:39.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:41.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Especially
this particular slide.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.324 align:middle line:84%
This is a meseta, and
there's not a lot of green.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:90%
It's just trees and shade.

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:50.496 align:middle line:84%
It's just walking, so
it's either pouring rain.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:54.767 align:middle line:84%
It's the worst weather in
hundred years when I walked.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Just in that
week -- or month?

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: In that
month, and it was --

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:03.576 align:middle line:84%
many days it just poured
rain, and wind would not stop,

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:06.779 align:middle line:84%
and cold, and there were
days when it was sunny.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.815 align:middle line:84%
It was never hot,
but when you're

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:11.584 align:middle line:90%
in the sun walking nine hours

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.385 align:middle line:84%
and you have nowhere,
you know, no place...

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:14.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No shade.

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: No shade,
and no place to --

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:90%
you just keep walking.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.827 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much I
walked out of everything

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.729 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't worth carrying.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Including
all of your...

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Grief, grievances,
resentments, angers, wounding,

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:90%
victimhood, confusion, karma.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And what did you
intuit that is happening

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.511 align:middle line:90%
in our world right now?

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:41.981 align:middle line:84%
Did you tune in to that,
or was it mostly about you?

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Absolutely.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:45.951 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a personal healing
journey, but two-thirds into it,

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:52.458 align:middle line:84%
I realized, we're not alone, and
every single person who works

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:56.262 align:middle line:84%
to raise their vibration,
to open their heart,

00:14:56.262 --> 00:15:00.899 align:middle line:84%
to listen to their guidance,
to trust their spirit,

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.403 align:middle line:84%
has a huge impact on
helping the ones around them.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.006 align:middle line:84%
We help each other
just by living

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:12.244 align:middle line:84%
in our own authentic flow,
and I, you know, at one point,

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:17.449 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk to anybody, and
by the end of it, I had friends.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:20.219 align:middle line:84%
People knew me and
we were friends,

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.289 align:middle line:84%
and so your consciousness
travels

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:28.227 align:middle line:84%
and we affect one another, and
I came back even more committed

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:32.398 align:middle line:84%
than ever to the messages
I've always been teaching.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:33.098 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Which are?

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...trust
your spirit, you know,

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:39.772 align:middle line:84%
listen to your guidance,
remember who you are.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:44.143 align:middle line:84%
Don't look for yourself
out here, and don't believe

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.478 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
a horrible place.

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.847 align:middle line:90%
It's not. Most

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.784 align:middle line:84%
of the horribleness
is from here to here.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:52.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:53.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And
we project it out.

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:57.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, in your
travels, did you come

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:02.194 align:middle line:84%
in tighter connection with
guides, like spirit guides, and?

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Absolutely.

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This picture -- the
next one's great, is you and --

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.935 align:middle line:84%
here's one of your main
guides, which is yourself.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah, that's my
higher self, and took that.

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:15.741 align:middle line:90%
I was like, look, I am so grown.

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:19.545 align:middle line:84%
I took the picture with my
camera right in my heart,

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:22.448 align:middle line:84%
because I was like, look,
there is my higher self,

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:25.884 align:middle line:84%
and really I was
like 12 feet tall.

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But I felt, I know, it's truth
that our spirits are huge,

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:42.835 align:middle line:84%
humongous, profound,
trustworthy, powerful.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what
about outside guides?

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.804 align:middle line:90%
Or are they the same?

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:46.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Oh, yes.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:49.541 align:middle line:84%
I had outside guides
all the time.

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:53.746 align:middle line:84%
My room at night was
filled with guides.

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:59.451 align:middle line:84%
This particular path also was
guarded by the Knights Templar,

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:03.756 align:middle line:84%
and the Knights Templar, I've
had many, many past lives

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:06.158 align:middle line:84%
in the Knight -- one
of the Knights Templar.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.292 align:middle line:90%
Many dreams.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.894 align:middle line:84%
I've written about it
in my very first book.

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell us who
the Knights Templar are.

00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:12.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: The Knights
Templar were a group of Knights

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:16.668 align:middle line:84%
who were formed to protect
the pilgrims originally to go

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:20.506 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem, but they
had discovered the bones

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:23.007 align:middle line:84%
of Saint James, so this
became a second pilgrimage.

00:17:23.007 --> 00:17:24.643 align:middle line:84%
It was the second
biggest pilgrimage

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:26.845 align:middle line:90%
in middle -- medieval times.

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:27.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: On the Camino?

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:28.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: On the Camino.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.117 align:middle line:84%
So there's a castle
there, and there's -

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.753 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were
all along there,

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.922 align:middle line:90%
and I knew that I had karma,

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:40.292 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars were
not necessarily --

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:45.264 align:middle line:84%
they were a very rigid group
of monks who were warriors,

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:50.069 align:middle line:84%
and they were -- they ran
the first banks and money,

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:56.341 align:middle line:84%
and they were very severe
in their own disciplines.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:00.679 align:middle line:84%
And some of them became fairly
corrupt, and they were all --

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:05.451 align:middle line:84%
the reason October 13 is such
a dark day is because the King

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:09.321 align:middle line:84%
of France at the time owed them
money, couldn't pay them back,

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:12.891 align:middle line:84%
so we had them all
slaughtered on October 13.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:13.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I know
I have karma.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.862 align:middle line:90%
I had karma with that,

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:20.032 align:middle line:84%
and so part of walking this
Camino cleared that karma, too.

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because it
felt so real to you?

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So real,
and I would wake up

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and my room would be filled
with the Knights in my room,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.009 align:middle line:84%
and they would be, like,
manifesting before me.

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:32.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Seeing them
for real?

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yes, and I would
hear their chanting as I walked,

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:39.518 align:middle line:84%
and then I would be walking with
them, and they were chanting,

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:45.257 align:middle line:84%
and so this was really --
told a wild ride for me.

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was working
on every dimension.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:49.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: But I
realized we need to know

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.036 align:middle line:84%
that we have guides,
that we need to know

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:01.907 align:middle line:84%
that it is too frightening
to our human egos

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:05.477 align:middle line:84%
to face the challenges
of the human experience

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
which can be very,
very challenging

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.184 align:middle line:84%
and at times very painful
because we cannot avoid loss.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:12.951 align:middle line:90%
We cannot.

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: We can't, right.

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And our guides
help us get through that.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And they are there.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Absolutely.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:23.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You call on your guides
when you need them the most.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:26.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: We tend
to call on our guides

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.767 align:middle line:84%
when we have exhausted
all our other resources.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:29.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: [Laughter]
Right, right.

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:31.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Unfortunately.

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: But I've
always worked with my guides,

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:37.242 align:middle line:84%
and they have always
been there and, you know,

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:42.681 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood makes us inclined
to expect Elvis to manifest

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
or shake and rattle and
roll, but guides are

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.886 align:middle line:84%
like butterfly wings
on your cheek.

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:51.189 align:middle line:90%
They're a wave of aha.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
They're a gentle knowing
that is so settled

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.196 align:middle line:84%
that our minds go,
wait a minute.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't real.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And sometimes
discounts.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: We are so
used to discounting it,

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but if we just began to
notice and say, hmm, maybe.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Okay. And we open it up.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:16.181 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
give it voice, just --

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:20.052 align:middle line:84%
if you just give voice to what
these subtle feelings are.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.853 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to listen, you
don't have to believe.

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:23.422 align:middle line:90%
Just give them voice.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:26.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I have a piece
here where you teach

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:84%
about your guide, about
looking for your guide.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.229 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
piece here by Sonia Choquette.

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:90%
[ Music and Video ]

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: When you learn
to begin to work with guides,

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:48.213 align:middle line:84%
it's a very exciting and
dynamic experience because it's

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
like opening yourself up
into a whole new universe,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.886 align:middle line:84%
and I created the
astroguides audio

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:59.157 align:middle line:84%
so that I could give you a
guided tour of that universe,

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:04.062 align:middle line:84%
and help point out to
you these subtle energies

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.964 align:middle line:84%
that are available
to support you.

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.967 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful to
listen to it on audio

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:12.671 align:middle line:84%
because maybe then you
can put it on your iPod

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:16.141 align:middle line:84%
and we can go outside, or we
can kind of go explore together

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:22.781 align:middle line:84%
and really begin to experience
guidance in the moment.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:26.985 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful supplement
to my book, Ask Your Guides,

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:33.225 align:middle line:84%
and it helps develop an
energetic sensitivity.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:36.194 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I'm working with
you, my guides are speaking

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:40.732 align:middle line:84%
through me so you'll begin to
sense the different nuances

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:45.871 align:middle line:84%
of vibration, and the different
tones, and the different feeling

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:50.876 align:middle line:84%
that each guide has,
and it's very exciting.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like the difference between
learning about the piano,

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.515 align:middle line:90%
and learning to play the piano,

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's just really
very exciting.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:03.288 align:middle line:84%
It kind of gives you a hands-on
experience of involving yourself

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:04.856 align:middle line:90%
with the subtle realms in a way

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:08.326 align:middle line:84%
that will only make your life
easier and more beautiful.

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:17.402 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:19.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So let me
ask you a question.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:22.007 align:middle line:84%
Looking at that, which you
probably recorded before

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:22.641 align:middle line:90%
your pilgrimage.

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:23.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:29.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do you see a
different Sonia in that video?

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:36.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I see
a younger Sonia,

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:39.858 align:middle line:90%
but I don't mean age-wise.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:46.198 align:middle line:84%
I see that the Sonia I am now is
everything that I'm saying there

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.399 align:middle line:90%
on steroids [laughter].

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Like what I would
say there, I --

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.675 align:middle line:84%
it's like I was snorkeling
in the ocean and saying look

00:22:56.675 --> 00:23:00.245 align:middle line:84%
at these fish, and now I'm
deep-sea diving and going,

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.348 align:middle line:90%
look at these fish [laughter]!

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:04.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, cool.

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.485 align:middle line:84%
I kind of shocked you
with that question, but...

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I'd like to know.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yeah.

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.023 align:middle line:90%
Everything there and more so.

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:14.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you've
grown so much.

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I think so.

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:19.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Even in your original
teachings that are so great

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.533 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to learn
more about and intuition,

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:23.268 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get
your experience now.

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:26.538 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was, continuing
on the journey here back

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:30.275 align:middle line:84%
to the pilgrimage, and
these are great stories

00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:31.376 align:middle line:90%
about it [laughter].

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.845 align:middle line:84%
What other types of
experiences did you have

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:34.913 align:middle line:90%
that you remember?

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Oh, I
have a great story.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:38.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And one
that's so good because by --

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:40.452 align:middle line:84%
it was the last three
days of the pilgrimage.

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.053 align:middle line:90%
I had only three days left.

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:44.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And I
had met two young men

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:47.826 align:middle line:90%
that were just so negative.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.327 align:middle line:90%
They had just shown up.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.429 align:middle line:84%
They were only doing the
last hundred kilometers,

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were from Ireland, and
they were awful, and I had been

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.835 align:middle line:90%
in such a serene state.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And they showed up,
and they were talking

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.073 align:middle line:84%
about the government and
American and politics

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and rip-offs, and everything
was just shocking my system.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:12.984 align:middle line:84%
So I said to them, I need to --
it was at dinner, and I said,

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:17.689 align:middle line:84%
I love you and I need to walk
away from this conversation

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:21.793 align:middle line:84%
because I'm in a really clear
state, and it's disturbing me.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:84%
And it's not personal, and
I'm not even arguing with you,

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:27.032 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying I can't
be present to this.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:30.969 align:middle line:84%
And they were angry, probably
felt a little bit like,

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.003 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are?

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:32.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:33.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: How could I?

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:35.941 align:middle line:84%
Very annoyed with me,
like how pompous of me,

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.108 align:middle line:90%
you know, and na na na.

00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:39.444 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to my
room and I journaled.

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, everything
on the Camino matters.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I wonder why I ran
into two dark angels.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.553 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning I saw them
and they gave me dirty looks

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:53.091 align:middle line:84%
and ignored me, and the next
morning, I was having breakfast.

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:56.761 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see them, and
I needed to get going.

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:59.664 align:middle line:84%
I had overslept and so
I took off and I walked

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:04.102 align:middle line:84%
for maybe four hours,
and I sat down to --

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:07.873 align:middle line:84%
at a café, and I was
going to get a coke

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.441 align:middle line:90%
because I needed energy.

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:15.247 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when I sat down
I left my purse, my passport,

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:21.319 align:middle line:84%
my credit cards, my ticket
home, all my money, everything.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:84%
I walked away from it,
and I didn't know where.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:34.099 align:middle line:84%
I did not know where, and it was
like panic, and it's all Spanish

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:39.504 align:middle line:84%
and nobody speaks Spanish,
and who comes walking down?

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:40.305 align:middle line:90%
My two dark angels.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, no.

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And the first
thing he said is what happened?

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.243 align:middle line:90%
And I said I lost my purse.

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:49.681 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where, and one
of them whips out his iPhone,

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
he's all over it, he's
Googling everything.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.286 align:middle line:90%
The other one speaks Spanish,

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:57.455 align:middle line:84%
Google's all the way
back, calls everybody.

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:59.157 align:middle line:90%
They find it.

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:00.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Somebody had
it in one of the little --

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
somebody found it turned
it in, and they sent it

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.033 align:middle line:90%
to where I was walking to.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.205 align:middle line:84%
Bought me a cup of
coffee, and I was like,

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:16.107 align:middle line:90%
"You are my Camino angels."

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Nobody's ever
called me an angel before."

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.212 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I called
you a dark angel two days ago,

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:25.483 align:middle line:84%
but now, I have blueprints
for me.

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:27.118 align:middle line:90%
You transformed me."

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:29.387 align:middle line:90%
And I was so grateful.

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:32.891 align:middle line:90%
I was just sobbing from relief.

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.726 align:middle line:84%
It's like don't ever
judge anyone.

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.361 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Don't
every judge anyone.

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:42.834 align:middle line:90%
It was -- anyone.

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:43.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What a great story.

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:45.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Isn't
that a wild story?

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:46.404 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:47.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:50.675 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, this was just one of
the lessons that came through.

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:51.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: One of so many.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa. So give
me the visual of --

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:56.715 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know we have
this great picture here

00:26:56.715 --> 00:27:01.453 align:middle line:84%
of the actual trail, but when
you would come to these towns,

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.054 align:middle line:84%
does the trail wrap
in the towns?

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:06.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: You follow little
shells and you follow arrows,

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.059 align:middle line:90%
and they come to little villages

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.961 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes there
are a little bit --

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:14.299 align:middle line:84%
couple cities along the
way, or little nothingness.

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.301 align:middle line:90%
It goes -- it -- the spectrum.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.802 align:middle line:90%
You just keep following.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Like Blue's Clues.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.573 align:middle line:84%
You just keep following
the yellow arrows.

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:22.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, and
then people --

00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:25.276 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands have
gone through this trail before,

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.946 align:middle line:84%
but people know when
you show up, you're on.

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And do they
take care of you, or?

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:31.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: They're kind.

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
You, you know, you
just go to bed.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.219 align:middle line:90%
You eat and get up and go.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:38.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It talks about
self-motivation now.

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:38.957 align:middle line:90%
It's great, though.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:84%
I was really a very powerful,
intuitive journey for me.

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, what about
your family, your daughters?

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I just
-- I left them all,

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.602 align:middle line:84%
and just said I need
this for me.

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:52.637 align:middle line:90%
They cheered me on.

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:57.842 align:middle line:84%
They met me in -- at the end of
it, I was teaching in Vienna,

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:00.311 align:middle line:84%
and one met me there, and
the next week I was teaching

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.647 align:middle line:84%
in Croatia, and the
other one met me there.

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:05.984 align:middle line:84%
And then we all had a nice
healing experience in Paris

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:84%
after that, so it
was quite a journey.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.324 align:middle line:84%
Quite a journey, and it was
very intuitive the whole way.

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:16.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So did you heal any
part of your relationship

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.896 align:middle line:84%
with your daughters
while you were...

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Absolutely.

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In what way?

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:24.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, you know,
I do know that as a family,

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:27.706 align:middle line:84%
human beings, we
go through a lot,

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.941 align:middle line:90%
we put each other through a lot.

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:33.244 align:middle line:84%
The human growth
experience is tough.

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.647 align:middle line:84%
To learn to come
back to yourself,

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:38.249 align:middle line:84%
to get over your patterns,
to get through your fears,

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:42.287 align:middle line:84%
to go through on a learning
curve, you are not in a bubble.

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:44.355 align:middle line:90%
You are affecting everyone.

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.491 align:middle line:84%
The canoe -- it's like
you're on the same canoe.

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:50.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And I just had
nothing but gratitude for them

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:53.431 align:middle line:84%
in my life, and asked
their absolute forgiveness

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:58.937 align:middle line:84%
for everything I had ever
done to cause them pain,

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:01.706 align:middle line:84%
and was grateful that
they were willing to.

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:04.843 align:middle line:84%
Of course they were willing
to extend that, but the depth

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:10.915 align:middle line:84%
of that gift to me as a
mother, I was so grateful.

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:13.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: In your experience
as a spiritual teacher going

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:16.788 align:middle line:84%
through life as conscious
as you possibly can be,

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.656 align:middle line:84%
what hurt could you
have imposed upon them?

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:22.861 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
I'm asking this is

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:84%
because it is the human
beings experience to grow,

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:31.436 align:middle line:84%
so whatever their experience
was, they were going to grow

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.338 align:middle line:90%
if you were a banker...

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:34.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Right.

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:36.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa. ...or if you
were a spiritual teacher.

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:37.842 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
choose and then grow.

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Nevertheless,
the human spirit is sensitive.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.384 align:middle line:84%
No matter how resilient
we are, and we can all go

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:50.021 align:middle line:84%
to the higher arc that says
we're all here for our lessons.

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:53.057 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't alleviate the fact

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:55.693 align:middle line:84%
that as we're learning
our lessons,

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
we step on each other's toes,
we hurt each other's feelings.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Not on purpose.

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: We
scare each other.

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Never on purpose, but that
doesn't mean we don't say I'm

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
sorry, at least for me.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.974 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you leave
your ego or anything

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.478 align:middle line:84%
that was left of
it on that trail?

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:17.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I'll tell you
what I learned: nothing.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:22.787 align:middle line:90%
Nothing good comes of the ego.

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:24.122 align:middle line:90%
Nothing. Never.

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:28.326 align:middle line:84%
Nothing. So, I have an ego,
and I -- it comes and goes,

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:33.231 align:middle line:84%
and I'm amused by it when it's
behaving, and I am very mindful

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:36.367 align:middle line:84%
when it swears up, and I
know that if I give that part

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:39.971 align:middle line:84%
of me importance, nothing
good will come of it.

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.341 align:middle line:84%
And I am acutely aware
of it all the time.

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.743 align:middle line:84%
I'm just listening
for my spirit.

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:47.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm just listening
for my inner teacher.

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:51.683 align:middle line:84%
I'm just listening for
God's grace, all the time.

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, this next photo
we have here is a beautiful

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
photo of you with
your certificate.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.656 align:middle line:84%
So you get a certificate
at the end of this?

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:00.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah, and
your name's in Latin,

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:03.328 align:middle line:84%
and it says that you walked
the Camino, and it's...

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Who gives
you the certificate?

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.764 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: You get it
from the Catholic Church.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:90%
If you walked a Catholic Camino,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you get what's called a
Compostela, which is the --

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.039 align:middle line:84%
says that you walked the
pilgrimage of forgiveness.

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.141 align:middle line:90%
It is the way of forgiveness.

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, so, and are
there signs along the way to,

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.648 align:middle line:90%
like, passages to read, or?

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: No,
no, but you get a --

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:28.019 align:middle line:84%
you have a passport and you
get it stamped every day.

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.922 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go, you get a
little Pilgrim stamp in it

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.457 align:middle line:84%
that says I've been
here and here,

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:35.593 align:middle line:84%
so it just shows you've been
-- you've walked the walk.

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:36.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Who gives
you the stamp?

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:40.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Wherever you stay,
the hostel that you stay in.

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:44.302 align:middle line:84%
There's a tourist
agency, or if a church.

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:46.037 align:middle line:84%
I got many -- I went
into the churches,

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:50.241 align:middle line:84%
and you get your little
stamp, and it's a little book

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:51.976 align:middle line:90%
that I'm very proud of.

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:54.946 align:middle line:84%
That's probably a
beautiful little book.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:57.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Oh, it's such
a wonderful memoir for me.

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Treasure, I'm sure.

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:02.053 align:middle line:84%
How will this journey in your
life, and I'm so grateful

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:04.489 align:middle line:84%
to be interviewing you right
off of that, just a couple

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.291 align:middle line:84%
of months ago when
you came home.

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.161 align:middle line:84%
How will this impact
your teachings?

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: A great deal.

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:14.766 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm a good
teacher, and I always feel

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.434 align:middle line:90%
like I've been a good teacher.

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:21.339 align:middle line:84%
I am really able to
break down intuition

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:25.877 align:middle line:84%
and help rewire people
back into the flow,

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:31.149 align:middle line:84%
but I feel what will
change is a deeper message

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:36.754 align:middle line:84%
about the importance of being
present, of moving energy,

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:41.292 align:middle line:84%
not sitting, not
thinking, not even trying

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:45.563 align:middle line:84%
to just meditate,
but move energy.

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:46.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Really move energy.

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:47.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Move
it out of your body,

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:51.669 align:middle line:84%
and to open that
space to forgiveness,

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.971 align:middle line:90%
compassion, and humor.

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:58.042 align:middle line:84%
It's really not -- I
always would teach dancing.

00:32:58.042 --> 00:33:01.145 align:middle line:84%
I'd always teach movement,
but now I understand

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:04.615 align:middle line:84%
that if you move
with some commitment,

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:08.619 align:middle line:84%
you can move your history,
you can move your karma,

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:11.356 align:middle line:84%
you can move your wounds,
you can move your grief.

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, you've
really deepened

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:13.825 align:middle line:90%
that level of your teaching.

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah,
that is true,

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:17.829 align:middle line:84%
and I know that to be true,
and I want to empower people

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:90%
with that understanding.

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:23.501 align:middle line:84%
We're such a heavy culture, and
I think -- and so left brain,

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:27.705 align:middle line:84%
and that's such a problem
for us as spiritual beings

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:30.808 align:middle line:84%
because we're in wrong
neighborhood [laughter].

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:31.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.745 align:middle line:84%
How has it changed
your life, or impacting

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:36.547 align:middle line:84%
about how you live
your live currently?

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:40.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, I don't
think about the past anymore.

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.219 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:44.322 align:middle line:84%
I live very much in
the present, 100%.

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:47.859 align:middle line:84%
I don't think much about
the future anymore.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.027 align:middle line:90%
It's not here yet.

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:54.365 align:middle line:84%
I am very invested in
creating a beautiful today,

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:57.835 align:middle line:90%
and my heart is very happy.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:34:00.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How do you plan for...

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I make
commitments, but I don't think

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:06.376 align:middle line:90%
about them until I show up.

00:34:06.376 --> 00:34:08.312 align:middle line:90%
I can make a commitment.

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:11.849 align:middle line:84%
I can set an intention,
but I don't think about it.

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:16.287 align:middle line:84%
I don't plan what I'm going
to say or do or, you know.

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:19.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You still set your
2014, 2015, whatever, goals?

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:20.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Sure.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I set my calendar.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.961 align:middle line:84%
I set my intentions, and
I always say I'm open

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:26.597 align:middle line:90%
to however that will unfold.

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:29.133 align:middle line:84%
I listen for my guidance,
and I'll live moment

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.869 align:middle line:84%
to moment knowing,
and going from here

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.172 align:middle line:90%
to there, but I'll listen.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.907 align:middle line:90%
I'll follow my intuition.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.608 align:middle line:90%
I'll listen for my spirit.

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:42.979 align:middle line:84%
I'll listen to guidance, because
my plans might be limited.

00:34:42.979 --> 00:34:45.983 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll have some
new guidance

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:47.852 align:middle line:90%
in the moment along the way.

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:49.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you get
the sense of experience

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:55.626 align:middle line:84%
that our times are changing,
are shifting, are speeding up?

00:34:55.626 --> 00:35:00.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Absolutely, and
part of what I want to say

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:07.438 align:middle line:84%
to people is don't be afraid of
anything, and consider the value

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of being a timeless person.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.408 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.542 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've
stepped out of time.

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:16.447 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
pushed around by time.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.715 align:middle line:90%
It's a concept, too.

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What do
you mean by that?

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, you know,
we're always hurry up, hurry up,

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:25.389 align:middle line:84%
get going, or slow down, slow
down, you're going to miss it,

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:28.559 align:middle line:84%
or be young, or don't
grow older.

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.495 align:middle line:84%
It's all of these
time constrictions

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:35.066 align:middle line:84%
that keep managing our
lives and fear, so.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: They're limiting.

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Very, and
they take time, you know,

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.206 align:middle line:84%
that I feel -- I
want to stretch time.

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:46.544 align:middle line:84%
To be fearful about time
collapses your time,

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:48.379 align:middle line:84%
and it makes you feel
like you have to hurry up,

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:52.049 align:middle line:84%
or it's running out,
but I tend to live now

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:54.452 align:middle line:90%
from a timeless paradigm.

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:55.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wonderful place?

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:56.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yeah.

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We're going to
take a look at a video here

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.925 align:middle line:84%
that Sonia did about
tuning in her latest book.

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.159 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Hi, I'm Sonia
Choquette, inviting you

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:08.633 align:middle line:84%
to read my brand-new book,
Tune In: Follow Your Intuition

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.968 align:middle line:90%
to Fulfillment and Flow.

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:14.472 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I teach
you how to awaken

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:17.642 align:middle line:84%
and live your most
authentic empowered life.

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.544 align:middle line:90%
It happens in four phases.

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:22.313 align:middle line:84%
The first phase is what
I call the wake-up call,

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:26.284 align:middle line:84%
and this happens when you've
experienced a sudden disruption

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to your life, whether
it might be an accident,

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.058 align:middle line:84%
or you lose your job,
or a relationship ends.

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:36.961 align:middle line:84%
Or it could actually even
be something more subtle,

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.731 align:middle line:84%
like just a disease
or an unhappiness

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:46.537 align:middle line:84%
that you can't shake, causing
you to begin to go inward

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.639 align:middle line:84%
and start listening
to a part of yourself

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:51.309 align:middle line:84%
that maybe you've been
ignoring for a long time.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.977 align:middle line:84%
That leads you to
the second phase,

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.712 align:middle line:90%
which I call digging deep.

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:58.516 align:middle line:84%
In this phase, you actually
begin to hear and feel

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:01.652 align:middle line:84%
and sense your inner
voice, your inner guidance,

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:04.488 align:middle line:84%
which really is the voice
of your authentic self.

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.857 align:middle line:90%
That's what your intuition is.

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.693 align:middle line:90%
But you're not sure.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:13.564 align:middle line:84%
You're not confident, so you
start looking for validation,

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:17.301 align:middle line:84%
reassurance, you make -- go to
the Internet and read articles

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.904 align:middle line:90%
on intuition, or read books,

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:24.075 align:middle line:84%
or begin to introduce the
conversation with your friends.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:29.614 align:middle line:84%
But what you're really looking
for in this phase is permission

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:35.686 align:middle line:84%
to begin to live from an inner
authority, your inner voice,

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:38.222 align:middle line:90%
your inner teacher, intuition.

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:41.158 align:middle line:84%
Gathering all that up leads
us to the third phase,

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:44.562 align:middle line:84%
which is called taking the leap,
because no matter what you feel

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.631 align:middle line:90%
or how much evidence you get

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:50.268 align:middle line:84%
that you should trust what you
feel until you actually act

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.269 align:middle line:84%
on it, nothing's going
to change in your life.

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:54.005 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to take the leap

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:57.375 align:middle line:84%
of following your inner
voice, your authentic self,

00:37:57.375 --> 00:38:00.678 align:middle line:84%
this natural guidance
system that you have,

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:04.649 align:middle line:84%
life begins to shift
very dramatically

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.251 align:middle line:90%
and in a very positive way.

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.488 align:middle line:84%
People have asked me, well,
am I leaping into the void?

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:13.758 align:middle line:84%
It scares them, but what
I want you to know is

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.293 align:middle line:84%
that you're not leaping
out there.

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:22.366 align:middle line:84%
You're taking a leap back
into your own authentic power.

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:25.803 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that you
enter the fourth phase,

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.571 align:middle line:90%
which is this very incredible,

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:31.042 align:middle line:84%
magical shift called
entering the flow.

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:35.079 align:middle line:84%
When you enter the flow, it's
your inner self guiding you.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.181 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking,
you're not figuring out.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You're actually just
following your impulses,

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
sort of like surfing,
dancing with life,

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.125 align:middle line:84%
but you end up experiencing
a graceful transformation,

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:52.163 align:middle line:84%
synchronicities, one after the
other, right place, right time,

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:55.466 align:middle line:84%
opportunities open up,
people begin to support you,

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:58.469 align:middle line:84%
things that you never even
dreamed possible begin,

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:01.172 align:middle line:90%
very easily land on your feet.

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:07.344 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole process is
what is available to all of us,

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:10.448 align:middle line:84%
and it's the natural
way we are all moving.

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:12.316 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to
read the book.

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
tune in and begin

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.355 align:middle line:84%
to trust your most
authentic, empowered self.

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:27.431 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:38.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is -- you're of
course teaching about tuning in

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.111 align:middle line:90%
and going with the flow and all

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:42.146 align:middle line:84%
of that you did while
you were on your journey.

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I just feel
the need to ask you so much

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:48.219 align:middle line:84%
about this pilgrimage
because it takes such a leap

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.488 align:middle line:90%
of faith to go and to do.

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes, it did.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:56.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But it also has
to have a really big why.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Not for me.

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No?

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: See, when
I, living by my guidance,

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:90%
why is an intellectual question,

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.974 align:middle line:84%
and I don't listen
to my intellect much.

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:13.043 align:middle line:90%
I just said okay, and had no --

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.845 align:middle line:84%
and that's pretty
much how I live.

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:16.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Have you always
known about the Camino?

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: No.

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I had read -- a long time ago,
I read Shirley Maclean's book,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.989 align:middle line:90%
and thought, all right.

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:30.227 align:middle line:84%
You know, it didn't -- it
wasn't something that stuck.

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:33.631 align:middle line:84%
I enjoyed it, but it
wasn't -- so -- and then...

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:34.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What was her book?

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:35.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: The Camino.

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, okay.

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:39.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So then two or
three people in the course

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:43.707 align:middle line:84%
of the maybe year and a
half before I went had shown

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.342 align:middle line:90%
up in my life in various places.

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:49.780 align:middle line:84%
One in Australia, one in
Chicago, and I'm not sure

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.216 align:middle line:84%
where the third, and they said,
"You have to go on the Camino."

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:58.989 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, I do, but
I didn't really say I will.

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.257 align:middle line:90%
It was like okay.

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.725 align:middle line:90%
That feels right.

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, so your
intuition said yes.

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:04.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So
then I went speaking

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:08.899 align:middle line:84%
at the first global conference
on human spirituality,

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:11.702 align:middle line:84%
and I was very conflicted
why I was there.

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:15.506 align:middle line:84%
I was in so much personal
turmoil, and I spoke,

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.942 align:middle line:84%
and I got to the airport
and sat in my seat,

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:23.147 align:middle line:84%
and I clicked my buckle,
and I heard it so loud,

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:90%
"Walk the Camino, and go alone."

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.287 align:middle line:90%
And I went, okay, okay.

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:34.792 align:middle line:84%
So I went home, and that
was in December, a year ago,

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:39.597 align:middle line:84%
and I said to my
business partner Ryan,

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.332 align:middle line:90%
I'm going on a pilgrimage.

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:45.636 align:middle line:84%
And he thought I was crazy
because I had just --

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:50.107 align:middle line:84%
I was taking kickboxing to try
to move some of my own energy

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:52.042 align:middle line:84%
in a different way and
some of my frustrations,

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.777 align:middle line:90%
and I'd broken my knee.

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ow.

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:56.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And I was just
coming out of a wheelchair

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
after five months in a
wheelchair, so he said,

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.454 align:middle line:84%
"You're going to walk five
hundred and some miles

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.256 align:middle line:84%
across a country
with your knee?"

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:08.959 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "I'm going to try.

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I've got the guidance
to do that, so I'm going

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.933 align:middle line:90%
to do it, and we'll see."

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:18.836 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
live with guidance.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.871 align:middle line:90%
I don't ask many questions.

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You trust it that much.

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:23.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I trust
it absolutely.

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:24.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:27.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And
it's never, ever,

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:30.481 align:middle line:90%
ever been a problem for me.

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Never wrong.

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:32.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Never.

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.951 align:middle line:84%
Years ago I was told
to go to France,

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.719 align:middle line:90%
and I had $500 in my pocket.

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.122 align:middle line:84%
I got the guidance to
go to France and ended

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:41.058 align:middle line:84%
up with a five year
scholarship to the Sorbonne.

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: It works
out, and my point is

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:90%
that that's not exclusive to me.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:52.703 align:middle line:84%
The universe is that generous
if you'll just say yes.

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:55.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you've been doing
this for 40 years with guides

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.509 align:middle line:84%
and working with your
intuition and teaching about it.

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, you
know, Lisa, it's like this.

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:04.648 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have
to build the Taj Mahal.

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.317 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
turn on the light,

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.952 align:middle line:90%
and it's hardwired in you.

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:09.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You just
start somewhere.

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So I teach
people to turn on the light,

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.961 align:middle line:84%
and it works, so it's
not a matter of you

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:19.797 align:middle line:84%
to create a relationship
with it to work.

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:22.766 align:middle line:84%
You begin to create a dynamic
so you have enough experience

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:26.971 align:middle line:84%
that you think this works,
and you feel so good.

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Your whole energy expands,
so it's not a mental effort.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.245 align:middle line:84%
It's a -- you relax
into because it's

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.547 align:middle line:90%
like putting a key in a lock.

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.182 align:middle line:90%
It clicks; it opens.

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So do you distinguish
that voice of your intuition

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:48.892 align:middle line:84%
from maybe just a hunch
or something that you...

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:51.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Wishful
thinking, for example?

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, right.

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:54.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, when I teach
to listen to their intuition,

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:58.869 align:middle line:84%
one of the tools that
I have is so essential.

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.871 align:middle line:84%
Every time you get a
gut feeling, a hunch,

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:04.375 align:middle line:90%
an aha, say it out loud.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:08.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Because intuition
comes up from the heart

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:13.083 align:middle line:84%
to the throat to the
ear, and you can hear

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:17.354 align:middle line:84%
if the vibration is
resonant with your essence.

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's why it helps
so much to talk it out.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Right.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.925 align:middle line:90%
You can't actually be

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:24.828 align:middle line:84%
as effective trying
to figure it out.

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.397 align:middle line:90%
You won't succeed.

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:27.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Too many
voices [laughter]?

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Too many voices.

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:31.101 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to
distinguish, but the sound

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:38.942 align:middle line:84%
of your own voice will let you
know, and that is hitting home,

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:43.947 align:middle line:84%
ringing true, if it feels
correct for you in the moment.

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And do you call your
intuition and information

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:49.119 align:middle line:90%
from your guides the same thing?

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: It's
the same channel.

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:52.623 align:middle line:90%
It's your inner teacher.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- your intuition
is like the radio station,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.431 align:middle line:84%
just like Gaiam has a
station that broadcasts,

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:04.468 align:middle line:84%
and so it's the station
that pulls in higher self,

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:08.072 align:middle line:84%
your guides, your
angels, all broadcast

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:12.342 align:middle line:84%
through this heart-based
station.

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:17.448 align:middle line:84%
And so it opens a spectrum
of and a variety of guidance

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.851 align:middle line:84%
that you can begin, just
like flavors in a recipe.

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:24.121 align:middle line:84%
You can begin once you
start to become familiar.

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.523 align:middle line:84%
You can start to
distinguish them.

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:28.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you said
earlier that to go

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:33.497 align:middle line:84%
on the pilgrimage alone, when
you click that belt, why alone?

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:36.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, at the time,
that would be if I had any kind

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:40.571 align:middle line:84%
of a question, but I don't
pursue those questions.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.873 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:46.143 align:middle line:84%
I would've preferred
-- my more human,

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.746 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable Sonia would've
preferred to go with someone.

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:51.014 align:middle line:84%
I'm a go with someone
kind of person.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:52.583 align:middle line:90%
I'm a middle child of seven.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.685 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hang in there.

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:58.288 align:middle line:84%
But now I can see that
especially as an intuitive

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:03.594 align:middle line:84%
and a sensitive, my energy
is often scanning and picking

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.262 align:middle line:90%
up not just my own experience,

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.331 align:middle line:84%
but the experience
of those around me.

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:11.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So the wisdom
of go alone is genius.

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:15.672 align:middle line:84%
I was able to tune into
exclusively my own energy,

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:19.309 align:middle line:84%
and I -- that is not a
very common thing for me.

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.511 align:middle line:90%
I'm always picking up.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:21.645 align:middle line:90%
That's my work.

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: That is my life
to pick up and tune clear

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:30.020 align:middle line:84%
across the world just on a phone
call or a Skype, I can dial-in,

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.022 align:middle line:90%
like a canary in the coal mine.

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:32.923 align:middle line:90%
So go alone.

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:35.826 align:middle line:90%
It was hugely healing for me.

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:37.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, there's
that new one.

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:40.497 align:middle line:84%
So for people who are
watching this and curious

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.666 align:middle line:84%
about doing this, and maybe
thinking about doing it

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:45.202 align:middle line:84%
on their own, would you
recommend to go alone?

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I would recommend
if you really do need to go

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:50.541 align:middle line:84%
with someone or feel like
you don't want to go quite

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:56.547 align:middle line:84%
that adventurous, at least
walking during the day,

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:57.748 align:middle line:90%
walk alone.

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:02.052 align:middle line:84%
Meet up at night, or walk
a good part of it alone

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:05.189 align:middle line:84%
where you're not just
talking and staying

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:09.793 align:middle line:90%
in your same mental frequency.

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:14.731 align:middle line:84%
You'll miss something, and I did
have the company in the evenings

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:15.899 align:middle line:90%
of other pilgrims, and some

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:18.068 align:middle line:84%
of them had a very
different experience.

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:21.071 align:middle line:84%
There were people drink
their way across, you know,

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:23.407 align:middle line:84%
and they had a very
different Camino.

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:25.976 align:middle line:84%
There were people went in
groups and argued and fought.

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:28.812 align:middle line:84%
They had a very different
Camino.

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You can create the quality
of Camino of your pilgrimage.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.688 align:middle line:84%
I had a beautiful experience
because of that quiet.

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Amazing.

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.991 align:middle line:84%
Well, did you create alters
for yourself out there,

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.693 align:middle line:84%
because I know you teach
a lot about alters.

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.061 align:middle line:90%
Did carry one with you?

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I did.

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:48.031 align:middle line:84%
I do carry an altar
with me and, you know,

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:52.469 align:middle line:84%
there's churches along the way
that are from medieval times,

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.538 align:middle line:90%
and they are so incredible,

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:57.441 align:middle line:84%
so I got to see these
beautiful alters.

00:47:57.441 --> 00:48:01.111 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting thing
is in the Catholic Church,

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:03.513 align:middle line:84%
there's mostly the
Jesus on the cross,

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:07.084 align:middle line:84%
but in these churches it was
always Mary holding the Christ.

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:12.289 align:middle line:84%
It was very feminine and very
nurturing and very beautiful,

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.423 align:middle line:90%
and that surprised me.

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:16.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, that's a
wonderful distinction.

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:17.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And
there are places

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:20.397 align:middle line:84%
where people created
alters with stones,

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.933 align:middle line:84%
so I tried to create an
altar pretty much every day,

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:26.637 align:middle line:84%
and prayed every day,
and listened every day.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a little
altar that I take with me,

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.143 align:middle line:84%
and in it I have my
pictures of my family,

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:37.481 align:middle line:84%
and I have found some
talismans from my life,

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:40.150 align:middle line:84%
something from India
which is very dear to me,

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and some of my rosaries
from a childhood.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.422 align:middle line:84%
And I have a prayer
book I've always carried

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:49.026 align:middle line:84%
and write my own prayers,
and I carry Gumby.

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:52.829 align:middle line:84%
Gumby's my totem, my joy
guide, so Gumby was part of --

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:55.532 align:middle line:84%
Gumby rode with me on my
backpack right in the front.

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:56.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: [Laughter] Oh, did he?

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:56.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's great.

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: So, yes.

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:01.672 align:middle line:90%
Alters are portals...

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:02.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...to
the subtle realms,

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.376 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they're
so powerful.

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:09.479 align:middle line:84%
They take us out of our
conscious third dimensional

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:12.816 align:middle line:84%
focus, and open us
to making contact.

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How interesting.

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: It's a more
beautiful, subtle realm

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.689 align:middle line:84%
so that are available that
want to make contact with us.

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'd love to learn how
to use them a little bit more.

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.159 align:middle line:84%
There's a video here I
want you to take a look

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.560 align:middle line:84%
at that Sonia talks
about alters,

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.132 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll find
out how to use them.

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Hi, I'm Sonia
Choquette, and I'm here today

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:34.805 align:middle line:84%
to share with you the
importance and the richness

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:37.341 align:middle line:90%
of creating a personal altar.

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:40.944 align:middle line:84%
Just like alters are the focal
point for spiritual contact

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:45.749 align:middle line:84%
in churches and mosques
and temples, they also have

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that same value for you if
you bring one into your home.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.858 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, alters were in
people's homes over many,

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:58.528 align:middle line:84%
many millennia and in most
parts of the world today.

00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:01.665 align:middle line:90%
So it's not an unusual thing.

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
To create an alter is simple.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.371 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is
bring together the things

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:10.741 align:middle line:84%
that uplift your heart
and help you make contact

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:14.378 align:middle line:84%
with your divine nature,
with God, with source,

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:18.348 align:middle line:84%
with spirit guides, with
whatever opens and expands

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:23.153 align:middle line:84%
and helps you feel your
greater connection with life.

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:26.156 align:middle line:84%
This is my Catholic altar
because I was raised Catholic

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:31.361 align:middle line:84%
and I still have a lot of real
deep connection with that.

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.663 align:middle line:90%
This is my Buddhist altar.

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:35.999 align:middle line:90%
This is around the Goddess Tara,

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:40.771 align:middle line:84%
and around this alter I have
collected Mollison prayer beads

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:44.775 align:middle line:84%
from around the world, and so
I'll sit in front of this alter

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:48.578 align:middle line:84%
and use them to pray
and meditate.

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:51.348 align:middle line:84%
Back here I have a little
tiny altar that's full

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:56.086 align:middle line:84%
of little Indian gods, and a
stone that was very special

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:58.922 align:middle line:84%
to me that I collected
on my travels.

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:01.558 align:middle line:84%
And make it small
because it doesn't have

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:03.827 align:middle line:84%
to be a big deal
to create an altar.

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:07.831 align:middle line:84%
You just bring together some
things that lift you up.

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.333 align:middle line:84%
I even made an alter
once on a napkin

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.969 align:middle line:84%
as I traveled just
putting flowers and petals

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:15.105 align:middle line:90%
and pictures of people I love.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So whatever works for you, the
idea is that it's a focal point

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:26.016 align:middle line:84%
where you can make contact with
God, with a source, with spirit,

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:28.452 align:middle line:84%
with your heart, and
all good things in life,

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:32.155 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very enriching
thing to create

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.090 align:middle line:90%
and visit in your home.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:38.295 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you do that, and
I wish you all my love.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So how do we do that?

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:45.268 align:middle line:84%
Do you invoke different
types of energies,

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.570 align:middle line:90%
or you just look at the altar?

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:47.404 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:48.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Well, you know,

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:50.907 align:middle line:84%
an invocation is
actually to call in.

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:52.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:54.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: So you sit
down and you just call

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:58.548 align:middle line:84%
in whatever your
spiritual construct is.

00:51:58.548 --> 00:52:02.352 align:middle line:84%
If it's, you know, Allah,
or God, or Mother Mary,

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:03.186 align:middle line:90%
or your higher self.

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The guides or whatever.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Or
guides, whatever.

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:08.124 align:middle line:84%
What you're really doing
is you're actually shifting

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:11.862 align:middle line:84%
out of your left brain into
your heart and opening to being,

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:16.299 align:middle line:84%
to making contact,
to say influence me,

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.869 align:middle line:84%
and your reaching
at the same time.

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:21.238 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you think
of that Sistine Chapel,

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:24.574 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo touching the hand
of God, that's kind of like

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:27.310 align:middle line:84%
when you work with your
alter, you're just reaching

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.247 align:middle line:84%
for the higher self
to reach you.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.848 align:middle line:90%
And you can sit for a minute.

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:34.885 align:middle line:84%
You can light a candle, a
little water, just a prayer,

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.419 align:middle line:90%
just put your hand there.

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:38.321 align:middle line:90%
It can be as long or short.

00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:39.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you're,
say, not feeling well

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:43.326 align:middle line:84%
or you have an illness or
something, do you use those?

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:46.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I would
say light a candle there.

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:49.232 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it did say I need
some help, and just sit,

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:52.736 align:middle line:84%
just pause for a moment
because it just opens you

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:54.671 align:middle line:84%
to a different dimension
of frequency.

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.473 align:middle line:84%
That would be a great
thing, or if you need help,

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:59.743 align:middle line:84%
if you're afraid of something
or a special request,

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:02.379 align:middle line:84%
or you need some more
confidence or assistance,

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:05.282 align:middle line:84%
or you're confused and
you want some clarity.

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you get sick
at all on the pilgrimage?

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:12.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, because it
rained and it was just so cold

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:14.758 align:middle line:84%
that there was illness
to the pilgrimage,

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:19.195 align:middle line:84%
and I got strep throat,
and I got pretty sick.

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:23.667 align:middle line:84%
I was really suffering
for a couple of days,

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.435 align:middle line:90%
and I knew I was going down.

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:30.006 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was going down,
and so I ended up going

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to a little infirmary that
they have occasionally,

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.813 align:middle line:84%
not in every town, but
occasionally for pilgrims.

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:39.749 align:middle line:84%
And I went in and this
beautiful woman helped me,

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and she gave me some medication,
and the pharmacy was open

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.389 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday for two
hours, so I got it.

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:50.994 align:middle line:84%
And I did suffer a few more
days, but after about five days,

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.762 align:middle line:90%
it started the lift again, so.

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You had a fever?

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: A terrible fever.

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:56.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And you walked?

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I was delusional.

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You kept
walking with it?

00:53:59.402 --> 00:53:59.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yeah.

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.004 align:middle line:90%
Had to.

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:03.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Had to because
you had to finish it

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.474 align:middle line:90%
in a certain amount of days?

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:05.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I had to finish
it in a certain amount of days

00:54:05.942 --> 00:54:07.644 align:middle line:84%
because I had to
teach in Vienna.

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, oh.

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:09.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yeah.

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:10.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see, yeah.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:11.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah, I
had this period of time.

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:13.583 align:middle line:90%
I had to keep walking.

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you set that
up for yourself on purpose?

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Or you wouldn't have known.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, I think
the fever helped burn off some

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:22.826 align:middle line:84%
of the, you know, muck
I needed to burn off,

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:26.329 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there was a
little past life, you know,

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:28.598 align:middle line:84%
burn it this day going
on there as well.

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.532 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think it
was [laughter].

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, wow.

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: It was

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:35.505 align:middle line:84%
like a spiritual tour
on steroids for me.

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Well I can tell it's deepened
your teachings so much more,

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.278 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk about some
of the teachings and some

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.314 align:middle line:90%
of the practices that you use.

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:48.118 align:middle line:84%
What can you teach us to
use during time of sickness

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.486 align:middle line:90%
or breathing or anything?

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Well, I'd like
to just give you a quick tool

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:54.157 align:middle line:84%
that will help you make
contact with your higher self

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.592 align:middle line:84%
and your guides,
and it is something

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.793 align:middle line:90%
that we don't give ourselves.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.228 align:middle line:90%
It's called room to breathe.

00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:01.031 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I'll
have you do is just --

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:05.468 align:middle line:84%
I ask everybody, look, just feel
all the energy that's troubling

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:10.674 align:middle line:84%
you, pulling on you, tugging on
you, scaring you, when you want,

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:84%
excited about, whatever, and
notice that you hold it...

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:15.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: ...in
your consciousness.

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Put your tongue on the
roof of your mouth,

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.484 align:middle line:84%
and exhale like you're
blowing out a birthday candle.

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:27.323 align:middle line:84%
Completely emptying the lungs
and breathe in through the nose,

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:30.193 align:middle line:84%
but clear into your belly,
clear into your tailbone,

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:32.962 align:middle line:84%
and then when you let
out the sound "ah,"

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:35.265 align:middle line:84%
open it up to hear
it click in the jaw.

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:35.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:36.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Ah.

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:40.003 align:middle line:84%
And allow the energy
to travel filled

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:42.839 align:middle line:84%
with your own spirit
from the inside out.

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:47.577 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to travel above you
and below you, to the north,

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:52.449 align:middle line:84%
the south, the east and the
west, in all six directions,

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:56.186 align:middle line:84%
pushing out everything that
is not you, not of you,

00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:58.922 align:middle line:84%
not of your beautiful
spirit, and doesn't serve you.

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:04.494 align:middle line:84%
Do this two or three times, and
it creates an energetic room

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:08.031 align:middle line:84%
to breathe, so you're
in the clear space,

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:13.269 align:middle line:84%
and in that space your mind
is quiet, you can begin to get

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:16.272 align:middle line:84%
in touch with your deeper truth
and your more authentic self.

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:19.275 align:middle line:84%
And in that space, just
put your hand on your heart

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:21.044 align:middle line:90%
and you can get guidance.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you're in pain or
any specific pain in your life,

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:26.116 align:middle line:84%
is that -- that's a good idea
to get a reprieve from it?

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:27.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah,
you just need to step

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:32.222 align:middle line:84%
and give yourself this
energetic room, above and below,

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:39.229 align:middle line:84%
north and south, east, expand
and fill that space up with you.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You get
your own little room.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:43.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yeah, room
to breathe, and it's filled

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:46.035 align:middle line:84%
up with you and anything
that is not you, not of you,

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.771 align:middle line:84%
doesn't serve you,
doesn't honor you,

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:51.307 align:middle line:84%
doesn't lift you
up, is moved out.

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And is there --
are there any specific tools

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.446 align:middle line:84%
that you used along the
way to really help you get

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.415 align:middle line:84%
through that walking
with the fever?

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yes, and this is
a tool that will help you get

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:02.919 align:middle line:90%
in touch with your intuition.

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:05.188 align:middle line:84%
I've used it before and
it came in very handy,

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:08.591 align:middle line:84%
and this is a tool I call
emptying the garbage.

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.761 align:middle line:84%
The reason we can't feel our
intuition is our mind is fall

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.396 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts and fears
and whatever,

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:16.266 align:middle line:84%
and so emptying the garbage is
simply to just take a breath

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:19.469 align:middle line:84%
and start naming what
you're afraid of.

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.037 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I won't
make the walk.

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:24.741 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I'll run out of
energy before there's a café

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.309 align:middle line:90%
and I can get something to eat.

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.511 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid that I'll
run out of water.

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:29.813 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid I'll hurt my ankle.

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.581 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid my knee
won't make it.

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.583 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid the rain won't stop.

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:36.653 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid my life
is out of control.

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:39.722 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I'm going lions
and tigers and bears, oh no,

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:44.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, and eventually,
you're quiet.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you've
just emptied all that,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.098 align:middle line:84%
and then you take a breath,
and I would take a breath

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:52.035 align:middle line:90%
and I'd say in my spirits, yes.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:55.271 align:middle line:84%
And the guidance would say,
you're going to be okay,

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.674 align:middle line:84%
and I would get guidance,
and I would get healing,

00:57:57.674 --> 00:57:58.708 align:middle line:90%
and I would get thoughts.

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is a tool
I taught for years.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.681 align:middle line:84%
It will always get you in
touch with your intuition.

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:08.284 align:middle line:84%
It's not fear that
causes our problems.

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.652 align:middle line:84%
Human beings will
always have fear.

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.821 align:middle line:90%
We'll never not have fear.

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:14.691 align:middle line:90%
It's hiding fear, stuffing fear.

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:15.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, ignoring fear.

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Managing, and
pretending it's not there

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:20.563 align:middle line:84%
that takes us away
from our higher self.

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:22.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you said something
really important there.

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:24.067 align:middle line:84%
You said, "And my
guidance says."

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: Yes.

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:29.205 align:middle line:84%
My hand on my heart, then
I give my guidance voice.

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:33.142 align:middle line:84%
My guidance says, and
see what comes up,

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:36.412 align:middle line:84%
and when I was telling you that
story about losing my purse,

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:40.316 align:middle line:84%
you know, my guidance
said, it'll be okay.

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.518 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid I won't get it.

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:42.719 align:middle line:84%
I don't have my passport,
I don't have a ticket,

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:43.887 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any money,
I don't know where it is.

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.021 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
get out of here?

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have a dime
to call someone to help.

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And here watching it...

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:51.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: And my
guidance says take a breath,

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:54.264 align:middle line:90%
room to breathe, it'll be okay.

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And did they
show up right after that?

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Within
five minutes.

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.536 align:middle line:90%
It was solved in 20.

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:03.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.041 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:08.745 align:middle line:84%
Well, what a wonderful example
and inspiration that you are

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:13.216 align:middle line:84%
to all of us to take the time
that you took in your life

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:17.553 align:middle line:84%
as a developed teacher, to go
out and to really take that time

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:20.023 align:middle line:90%
to deepen yourself even more.

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: You
know, it was important.

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:24.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's important,
life changing.

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: I'd
felt like in order

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:29.365 align:middle line:84%
to be an authentic teacher,
I can never sit back

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.067 align:middle line:90%
and say I know it all.

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What about an
authentic mother or wife?

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I feel

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:36.472 align:middle line:84%
as an authentic human
being, we all grow.

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.074 align:middle line:90%
We all face struggles.

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:41.411 align:middle line:84%
Don't ever think that
because someone's a teacher,

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.345 align:middle line:90%
they've arrived.

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:45.348 align:middle line:84%
The human journey
keeps unfolding

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.884 align:middle line:84%
and we help each
other, so when I walked

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:50.853 align:middle line:90%
up the Camino, I was a student.

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:51.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Always.

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Life,
always, yeah.

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:56.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, and then
your relationship is healed,

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:57.727 align:middle line:90%
and you're...

00:59:57.727 --> 01:00:02.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Choquette: Yes,
in fact my husband

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:06.102 align:middle line:84%
and I are really finding a new
relationship with each other,

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.205 align:middle line:84%
and we are realizing that
the gridlock that we got

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:13.109 align:middle line:84%
into was the patterns we
brought in from our families,

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:16.412 align:middle line:84%
from our own woundings, from
our own unfinished business,

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:20.583 align:middle line:84%
from habits that we had
entered our relationship.

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.652 align:middle line:90%
With this identity, we'd grown,

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.154 align:middle line:84%
but our habits hadn't
matched us.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:28.524 align:middle line:84%
So we are now reinventing
our relationship,

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:31.361 align:middle line:90%
and it's really wonderful.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, wow.

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:36.766 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sonia Choquette, ladies
and gentlemen [laughter].

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:37.667 align:middle line:90%
Thank you...

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:38.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Choquette: I'm so grateful.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...so much
for sharing your story,

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.405 align:middle line:90%
