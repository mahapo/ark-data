>>LISA GARR: If you
don't honor yourself

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
with every fiber of
your being, if you could

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
use more joyful play and
simple presence in your life,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and who doesn't, then maybe it's
time for an inner revolution.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a movement
happening, and it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
called the Warrior
Goddess Movement,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's being led by my
guest HeatherAsh Amara.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
After studying women's
studies at UC Davis,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
HeatherAsh apprenticed with
two really incredible women,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
a shamanic healer and
a Wiccan priestess.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:10%
And she found her
calling to wake up women

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:10%
all over the world to
reclaim their power.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr
and joining me is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.819 align:middle line:10%
the author of "Warrior Goddess
Training," HeatherAsh Amara.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHERASH AMARA: Thank you.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So tell me, how did you
get into such a passion

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:90%
for helping women?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
where you were raised.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I was raised
in Southeast Asia

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and traveled all over
the world as a kid.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And when I first came to the
United States to go to college,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:10%
I had the sense of like,
something is not right here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
I felt really disconnected.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And I got into politics
really big for a couple years.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And two years in,
my feeling was,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.644 align:middle line:84%
I'm angry all my friends are
angry, nothing is changing.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started studying

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
different spiritual traditions.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was just a
revolution because I realized

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
there was all of this
history around women

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
being in power and connected
and the divine feminine.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the introduction for me

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.595 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to share these
teachings with other women.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It had to come
from somewhere, though.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:10%
When you were experiencing
Southeast Asia, and so forth,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:10%
were you noticing women
weren't treated well,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:10%
or was there an
experience that you had?

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: No, the experience
I had was interesting.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was seven years old,
we were in India, my family.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
down the street,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and there was this little
girl who's about seven

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:90%
that was walking towards me.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was in rags and bare
feet and our eyes locked.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:10%
And everything disappeared
except for this little girl,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:10%
and we totally fell
in love with each,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:10%
other everything else went away.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And I realized
there's no separation.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:10%
And then we passed
and she was gone.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.905 align:middle line:84%
And it changed my life,
and then I forgot about it.

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.549 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah, as
moments like that happen.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: As moments
like that happen.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point
it came back to me,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that,
especially for women,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
it's so important for us,
we're so disconnected often,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and we can be so
competitive with each other

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that that sense of really
deep ageless connection,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
which is true with
all humans, is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
something that is incredibly
important for women

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.215 align:middle line:90%
to come back to.

00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you went
through this great phase

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
of going through activism, and
then studying women's studies.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And how did you meet
your two mentors?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: One of them was
introduced to me for a friend.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And I love how I met her.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.881 align:middle line:84%
My best friend and I, Autumn,
we went to the UC Davis Library,

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
we checked out every book
we could on women's studies,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
women's spirituality,
Earth-based spirituality,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
carried it back to our dorms and
spent the summer reading them.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
And then we decided--

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
mostly we're studying
European shamanism and ritual

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and ceremony and the cycles
of the moon, and we were like,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
let's do a ceremony,
let's invite someone

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
to do a ceremony.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And we had heard of this
woman named Star Hawk,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and she was totally
not available.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.744 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's a
super busy person.

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But someone said,
well, you should

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
meet this woman
whose name is Ahrim.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and she does stuff like this.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And she was a solo
practitioner at the time.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.275 align:middle line:84%
We basically
knocked on her door,

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
like, hi, we want
to study with you.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And she then introduced
me to Vicki Noble.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So she was one of my first
portals into this world.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:10%
And Vicki Noble is just
an exceptional author

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and shamanic healer.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.075 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So your soul
was looking for this.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yearning.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a great
example, and you followed it.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And the doors kept opening.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And led from
one person to the next.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Now what is the Wiccan art,
tell us a little bit about that?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: The word Wicca
means to bend or shape.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So that word, if you think
about the word willow,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is connected to learning to
work with the energy of nature

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:90%
and of life.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to live
in a very linear world

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
where, if you do this and this
and this, this will happen.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Whereas our ancestors, the
people that were more in touch

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
with nature, lived
in a cyclical way.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You knew when to plant because
you're paying attention

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:90%
to the seasons.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You knew about death because
it was happening constantly.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
that word Wicca then

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is about coming back
into harmony with nature.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why did a Wiccan
or any type of priestess

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
get a negative
connotation associated?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Now, pre-Christian--
Christianity, many of the women

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
were healers and midwives
and were deeply connected

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:90%
to their communities.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And when Christianity started
coming in, what happened

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is the women that had power were
killed during the Inquisition,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and the power was
taken back to the men.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And you it's not
connected to Christianity,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:84%
but that is how it
went down, basically.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.241 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this
just devastation.

00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
villages in Europe where

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%
every single woman was killed.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: In the village.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they
were said to have

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
been doing black magic
or bad things, and yeah.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.724 align:middle line:84%
And basically it was things
like they were healers,

00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
they were the midwives,
they were independent women.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so
out of this phase,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when you started
studying this, did

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
you connect to any
of that pain at all?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that so many of us

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
women keep ourselves small
because we have memory

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors or
of a past in our DNA.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this fear
that a lot of women have--

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I know I had to go through it--
of if I claimed my power, if I

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
really step back into my power
and share who I really am,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get killed or
people aren't going to like me

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.235 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going to be abandoned.

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It manifested
itself in the '50s.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just stay quiet.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.685 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: You stay quiet, you
stay small, you stay nice.

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you support,
and you hold up.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And many, many women
loved that position,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
but there were also those
that were Rosie the Riveter,

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.525 align:middle line:84%
and those that really
wanted to claim power.

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:36.325 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so is this,
though, where we maybe

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
learned we're not enough
or to be subservient

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
or maybe to be more agreeable.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
There was what I
call domestication,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that women are taught
you're safe if you're small,

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
you're quiet, you're nice.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier to

self-worth and saying,

you're not enough, you're
not doing it right,

or that's who you're
program to be,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
study that I heard

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
about on the news
about equal pay

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and how women had been more
agreeable to a lesser pay,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was more
acceptable for women

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to be more agreeable to, OK,
I'll take that less amount,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll get it and
I'll prove myself,

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll make more money.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's very common in this
study across the board, that's

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
what the women did.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And that feels safe.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
It feels like, well, I'll
just be quiet and nice

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe I'll get
something that I want.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't work
that way, we have

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to learn to find our power
to step back into our voice

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and to get solid
again with ourselves,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
so we're advocating
for ourselves.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I see with women is
we tend to abandon ourselves

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.256 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I think that's one of the--

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.463 align:middle line:90%

And it's a conglomerate of
all the things we've learned.

00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we're constantly
comparing ourselves

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
to who we think
we're supposed to be

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and finding ourselves at fault,
finding ourselves less than.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.899 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we abandon ourselves.

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of
saying, hi, sweetie, OK,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
what do you need right
now, what would serve you,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.606 align:middle line:84%
all the things
were breaking down,

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
my father was in
the Vietnam War,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
she was trying to make
it perfect for the kids--

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And we could see that.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But fast forward to
me having a daughter

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and that generation
of young people

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:90%
these days could care less.

with the social media.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%

everyone's posting the best

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%

>>AMARA: Life is messy.

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think about it
this way, for women,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
then, if we think about
just 100 years ago,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
women couldn't vote in
this country, right.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.034 align:middle line:84%
And so while as women we
have this incredible external

00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
freedom, we have
a lot of freedoms

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to vote, to choose who
we want to mate with,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
to decide what kind of
job we want to have,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
which is great in
America, in this country.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But internal
freedom, not as much.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%

But let's talk about the female
competition a little bit.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
When one does have those
great successes or those wings

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.545 align:middle line:84%
get spread, why do other
women want to cut them down?

00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: We've been
taught that there's

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
a scarcity of resources,
there's a scarcity of partners,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
there's a scarcity of money.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.792 align:middle line:84%
And when we live
in scarcity, when

00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
the belief is there's
scarcity, then of course you're

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.915 align:middle line:84%
going to start competing,
because there's

00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that fear of there's
not enough for me,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
so therefore I have to
compete against her.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the depth
of the competition

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
is this feeling
sense of survival,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that the only way I can
survive is to be better than.

>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and so we have
to become really aware of where

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that impulse and where the
training comes from and realize

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that, if we look back
at a lot of tribes,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
women were very connected,
there wasn't competition.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%

deep cooperation.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.021 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And then
I just watched what

00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:90%
the reaction was internally.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
feeling sense of,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm doing what
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But it would always
change the rules.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what perfectionism

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
is, it's an endless
chase, it's a mirage.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It is.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like
chasing a rainbow.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.815 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.055 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It doesn't exist.

00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unless you're perfectly
OK with exactly the way it is.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:26.585 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:13:26.585 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what perfect is.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.313 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: That's what perfect is.

00:13:29.313 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so for women to start
looking in the mirror,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know any
woman, or there's

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
very few women that look in the
mirror and are just, like, ah--

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Hi, beautiful,
you're so great.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:90%
We're like, my nose.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.486 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even models, even
people that you would say

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
would be displayed on magazines
as the picture of beauty,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
they see flaws in themselves.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.183 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's an innate thing.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
that comes from?

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I just
think it's trained.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
If there were no
mirrors-- imagine

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
if there were no mirrors
and there was no media.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.936 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, we'd looked
down and we'd see it.

00:14:00.936 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: There's no newspaper.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But we wouldn't have
an image of this

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
is what a woman is
supposed to look like.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We have no concept of that.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.606 align:middle line:84%
It would just be,
oh, this is my body.

00:14:09.606 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But even back in
Marilyn Monroe days and where

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.775 align:middle line:84%
she was a sex symbol, it
was a different symbol

00:14:16.775 --> 00:14:17.575 align:middle line:90%
than it is now.

00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's change.

00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's changed.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:90%
And the style has changed.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And that partially shows
you, it's not real,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.165 align:middle line:90%
it's not based on anything real.

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
If it was based on something
real, it would be consistent.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not consistent, because the
flavor of what we want changes.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Now it's skinny, 96 pounds.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Before it was
voluptuous, more rounded.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:40.955 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the basic
bottom line here

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we satisfy our
own need with what we want.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.275 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
does that look like.

00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: To go towards
what do you want to feel.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: To start
stepping back from what

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
do I look like and start
to go inside and say,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
how do I want to
feel in my body.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
How do I want to feel in my
relationship to other people?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And to find the feeling quality.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So that might be, I
want to feel peaceful,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel comfortable in
my skin, I want to feel excited.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It can be a lot of
different things.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But once you have that
focus, then instead

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of always comparing yourself
to who you should be,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:84%
now you're on a
quest of, how do I

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
bring that feeling sense of
being comfortable with my skin

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%
into my body.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I, mean
here's an example.

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.145 align:middle line:84%
When you go home and you get
into comfortable clothes.

00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:31.945 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:15:31.945 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You usually look
like you have bags on, right?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Who wears really tight
skinny clothes at home?

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Right, right.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.355 align:middle line:90%
And you feel comfy.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, no, when you get
into comfortable, loose-fitting

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
clothes and you
feel great, there

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
is not an acceptance to wear
that outside of the home.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, because
there's this idea

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
of what you should look like.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's a balance.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because, for me, what
I'm working to do

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and helping to train
other women to do

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is to feel comfortable in
one's skin, no matter what,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
even if there's a
particular way that

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is beneficial to look because
it'll help you in society.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
That's great, put that role
on, put that costume on,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.504 align:middle line:90%
but it's a costume.

00:16:14.504 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And they know you
can take it off.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And that
the real you isn't

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
any costume, it isn't any
role-- mother, businesswoman,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:90%
they're all roles.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
several things here,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
speaking our truth, .

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what it feels
like to be full of boundaries.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about these
things that redefine women,

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
speaking our truth.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.554 align:middle line:84%
Often what I see
us do is that we're

00:16:40.554 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
afraid to speak our truth
because we're either

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.928 align:middle line:84%
afraid we're going
to hurt somebody

00:16:43.928 --> 00:16:45.322 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to be abandoned.

00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:46.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because we're sensitive.

00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Because
we're sensitive.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to hurt
anyone, we want to be nice,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:90%
we want to be kind.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And we also don't want
people to go away.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we often then are
moderating our voice.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But learning to speak
our truth and really

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
stand in what's authentic for us
doesn't mean we have to be mean

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
or have to be like, rah, this
is the way it is, period.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
We can be incredibly
compassionate

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:84%
and learn to speak our
truth at the same time.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
thing with boundaries.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Often with telling the truth
and with making boundaries,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.755 align:middle line:90%
what I see is we often wait.

00:17:18.755 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to do it.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.296 align:middle line:84%
And then when we do
it, we're like, ah--

00:17:22.296 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
this incredible frustration
or aggression because we've

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:90%
been holding it back.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you learn to
open to what your truth is

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and really love
what your truth is,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
it's really easy to share
it with other people.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, part of it is
wanting to be peacemakers.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to be peacemakers
of the family and of the tribe,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and they bring in the peace.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
adversity or when

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
there's ill feelings or
people don't like you,

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't bring
peace to the tribe.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So do we have to just be
comfortable with the fact

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.718 align:middle line:90%
that there isn't peace?

00:17:53.718 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, my motto is
to get comfortable with being

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
discomfort, the places

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
where it's uncomfortable
where the most change happens.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we're willing
to step towards that

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
rather than run away
from it and stand in,

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.706 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's uncomfortable,
and this is what is.

00:18:12.706 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And not try to fix it.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: And not try to fix it.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Not care take.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not try to make it nice.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Let other people
be uncomfortable as well.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We were raised to
be nice girls, weren't we?

00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: We were.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.654 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and we're good at it.

00:18:26.654 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is, it's like giving
up something that you're

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
really good at
for something that

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:90%
feels really awkward and scary.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's not truthful.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But then there is
a backlash of we're

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
not going to be nice girls,
were going to be anything but.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.715 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, pendulum.

00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does that have to happen
to come to a middle ground?

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It often
does, it often does.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
there's a swing

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.234 align:middle line:84%
as we're trying
to find our voice.

00:18:51.234 --> 00:18:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Think about it, if you've
repressed your voice

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
for your entire life and
every time you're at work

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
your co-workers are like, where
do you want to go to lunch.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And your response is, I don't
know, where do you want to go.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And one day you decide, I'm
going to speak my truth.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Either you go, Italian, I
want to go to, like, err!

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.831 align:middle line:84%
Or, well, I'd like to go to
Italian, would that be OK.

00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you want to go to Mexican?

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, Mexican, we'll do Mexican.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.455 align:middle line:90%
You either over--

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.405 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Or go back, right?

00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:18.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:18.205 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And so there's
that uncomfortable place

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
of going through the process
of staying with yourself.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
a warrior goddess is?

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Being OK with
being with yourself,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
but not being
aggressive with it.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, yeah, being
in your process and staying

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
with yourself.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you make a mistake,
that you go correct and it.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And know that it's messy.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Learning about
ourselves and learning

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to rewire all these
patterns that we have,

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.372 align:middle line:90%
it can be messy at times.

00:19:47.372 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
paying attention, we

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.366 align:middle line:84%
can then clean it
up and try again.

00:19:50.366 --> 00:19:51.365 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we learn.

00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When women
come to your workshops,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
what's the biggest
thing as a collective

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:90%
that women have to work through?

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: One of
the biggest things

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:90%
is apologizing for ourselves.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've really studied this in
myself and watched other women,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we're apologizing
because we're being nice.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But what most of us are
actually apologizing

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
for is taking up space, is
just having being on the planet

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and taking up space.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize it, but if
you start watching yourself,

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many women,
somebody stomps on your toe,

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.901 align:middle line:90%
and you're like, I'm sorry.

00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.794 align:middle line:84%
Or you bump into
someone, I'm sorry.

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, I'm like, oh.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And there's
this shrinking.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I tell women when we do the
workshops, if you're late,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%
please don't do this.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Just come in, practice.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And we always say to each
other, somebody apologizes,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
we immediately say,
you're beautiful--

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:90%
to rewire.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.644 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's so sweet.

00:20:48.644 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you go,
oh, that's right.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
apologize for myself.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't need to.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is definitely
ingrained in the culture

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:54.815 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It is.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.815 align:middle line:84%
And then you learn how
to really apologize.

00:20:57.815 --> 00:20:58.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How's that?

00:20:58.795 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: That when you
actually do something

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
that is hurtful to somebody,
then you can actually show up

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and say, I am so sorry.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that must have
had a big impact for you.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.727 align:middle line:84%
And it's sincere, you're
fully in the apology.

00:21:13.727 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But you're not beating
yourself up about it.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, OK, I
made a mistake, let

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.725 align:middle line:84%
me apologize, and then move on,
and learn from that mistake.

00:21:20.725 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, about that
authenticity, when women don't

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
speak their truth to other
women, when they say,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
look, you did this
and it really hurt me

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you can do
this in a different way

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.337 align:middle line:84%
and it will serve you better,
women don't do this very often.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: They don't.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: They don't.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I wish we would.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I do, too.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.901 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in this
"Warrior Goddess Training,"

00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
we actually have a
video here of you

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
talking about
that, about what it

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%
means to be a warrior goddess.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: We're coming
back home to ourselves.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:10%
And we do this by blending these
two really important energies.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:10%
The first energy is warrior.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean
to be a warrior?

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, the warrior quality
is about focus, clarity,

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:10%
commitment, 100%.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:10%
So the movement that goes with
it, you can do this with me,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:10%
[EXHALES] is this.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:10%
So that bringing yourself
together, knocking things over

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:10%
as you do it,
[EXHALES],, total focus,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:10%
total clarity, bringing yourself
100% here, committing to you.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:10%
The goddess energy
is about opening.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:10%
It's about bigness, it's about
creativity, receptivity, joy.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So the movement is [SIGHS].

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Do it again, I
like the sound too.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:10%
[SIGHS] So you can
feel that when we

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:10%
open into that goddess energy.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of different
ways to be a goddess,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
there's not just one.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:10%
That we are able to feel
our way through things.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.547 align:middle line:10%
I feel like the warrior
energy says, I'm going here

00:22:56.547 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to get there
as quickly and as efficiently

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:10%
as I can.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:10%
And the goddess energy
says, ooh, we're

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:10%
traveling along this path, let's
see who we can bring with us

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:10%
and how we can
bring love and joy

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:10%
and creativity on our journey.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:10%
So we want both, to bring
both these energies together.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's not that
warrior goddess

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:10%
is about you're a
good warrior goddess

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:10%
if you're a 50% warrior
and 50% goddess.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:10%
Really, what we're
wanting to do is

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:10%
find what's your unique
expression in the world.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:10%
What's your essence?

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:10%
And for some of us, we're
much more warrior-oriented.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:10%
And for some of us, we're
more goddess-oriented.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And you may find you're 50/50.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:10%
It's all good.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:10%
But we're here to let go
of the old shells of who

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:10%
we've been so that we
can find out who we are.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's a beautiful
exploration of letting

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:10%
go of old belief
systems, old agreements

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:10%
that we've taken on from our
families, from our church,

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:10%
from our peers.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:10%
So that we get to write our own
moral code, what's true for us.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.122 align:middle line:10%
And that's the
warrior goddess way.

00:24:06.122 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I like that in the
video you talked about being

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
a warrior and being a goddess,
but being it at the same time .

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.185 align:middle line:90%
You're not either a warrior or--

00:24:15.185 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: A goddess.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And that place that we're
not trying to be 50%,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
we're finding what's
our flavor, what is

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
our mix of those two energies.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Because those energies
are both so important.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are
examples of women

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
in the world that we would
know as public figures that

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.195 align:middle line:90%
are warrior goddesses?

00:24:35.195 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: So many.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.155 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I think about,
let's think of this.

00:24:39.155 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
The women in the
Me Too Movement.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So the women that
are speaking up,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
incredibly scary,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.565 align:middle line:90%
definite warrior goddesses.

00:24:50.565 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: In the face of
very strong public figures.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.961 align:middle line:10%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:54.835 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That are men.

00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:10%
>>AMARA: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And they're going
to have to continue,

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.507 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to have
to keep going into battle.

00:25:01.507 --> 00:25:02.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over and over again.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And getting torn down and
getting publicly shamed.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and
standing back up again

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:90%
and standing back up again.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think of
also the youngsters

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that are now stepping
out and really talking

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.782 align:middle line:84%
about gun control or
talking about issues that

00:25:18.782 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:90%
are really important to them.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:84%
There are some amazing
young women that are like,

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to do it the
way it's been done before.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Things have to change.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because it didn't work.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how
we got to this place.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
warrior goddesses

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:84%
that you have as an example that
don't go into battle like that.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I immediately think about
a dear friend of mine.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
She's like, I'm not an
activist, I sit and I pray,

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:90%
and that's my service.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I vision what's possible.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And as a young
activist at the time,

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well, that
doesn't work at all.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm like, thank
you for doing that,

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
because we need the people
that are out in the world that

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:90%
are making change.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But I also really believe
we need the people that

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
are going in that are getting
still, that are praying,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that are visioning
new possibilities.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And everything in
between, everything in between.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.871 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I notice that
I get to those bases,

00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
but then I get sucked back into
my life where I get overwhelmed

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
very quickly with duties at
home and all that goes with that

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and trying to work
in between and--

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Aging parents,
and you get pulled.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It's so
easy to get pulled.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and that place
of going towards the stillness,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.326 align:middle line:90%
and that's the best way.

00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways to
get to know ourselves

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
is to start to weave more
stillness into our lives.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.215 align:middle line:84%
So we're so habituated, there's
a little gap in our life,

00:26:41.215 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
and we're like, palm.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Right?

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Or let me worry about
what's coming up.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: And so.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We plan.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.315 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Let me plan.

00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's make my list.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: But you can
completely rewire your life.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And it it's challenging,
but it's also super simple.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's a gap, you're
waiting in line for coffee,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
you're at the stoplight,
you're walking on your way

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to the bathroom, and we have
hundreds of gaps every day

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in our life to start
to train ourselves

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to go towards stillness, to
breathe, to settle, to just

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.995 align:middle line:84%
relax the body, to open,
to let intuition come in.

00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
doing is we're

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
filling every single
second in our lives.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.804 align:middle line:90%
And we're doing that.

00:27:22.804 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But I do that.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I take moments at the
stoplight and I take moments.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Beautiful.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.262 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then I think,
they're not enough.

00:27:29.262 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Image of perfection.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I must have more.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.008 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I must have more.

00:27:33.008 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yeah.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.097 align:middle line:84%
And then how to bring that
same stillness into the chaos.

00:27:38.097 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That it's OK if you
have five moments like that,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it's OK if you have
25 moments like that.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly, yeah.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.172 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every now and then
I'll take a phone call outside,

00:27:46.172 --> 00:27:47.255 align:middle line:90%
and I'll just walk around.

00:27:47.255 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Nice.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.463 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And just sit
in the sun for a minute

00:27:49.463 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and look at water or something
that allows me to just go back

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
into that parasympathetic
nervous system that

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
heals the body, goes back into
repair, and loosens the back.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all OK.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about feeling deserving.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Deserving to get a massage,
deserving to take a vacation,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:90%
or you're not working.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Deserving to take some time
off without feeling like it's

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.616 align:middle line:90%
not enough.

00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:20.994 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Learning to receive.

00:28:20.994 --> 00:28:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, that's the word.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Learning to receive.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the word.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:10%
And that deservability
in receiving,

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:10%
often there's
incredible discomfort

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:10%
in receiving because
we're trained to be givers

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>AMARA: I'm valuable
if I'm giving.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.425 align:middle line:10%
If I'm receiving, there's
something wrong, I'm selfish.

00:28:37.425 --> 00:28:38.225 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:38.225 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I'm not a good girl.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's again that willingness
to be uncomfortable and learn

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:90%
how to receive.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
in little ways.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Just like you said, going
outside and just being

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in nature a little bit, you're
receiving from the Earth,

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:90%
you're receiving from the sky.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.965 align:middle line:90%
That's a practice.

00:28:54.965 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That counts.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: That counts for sure.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And anytime we're
changing a pattern

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that we have to keep bringing
in little, little, little ways

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to do it, little baby
steps I think about.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Receiving.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I have
to put it on my phone.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To say, I need to--

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Now receive, yes.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
that there's a way,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
traits that you can do in order
to become a warrior goddess

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and its way--

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:90%
W-A-Y.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.656 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: To connect
with your wisdom,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
your authenticity,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and connect with your yes.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So each of us has
this deep, deep wisdom

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:90%
in our bones, women and men.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And to again go
into the stillness,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to
start to slow down.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
letting the mind say,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.006 align:middle line:84%
this is who you should be,
this is how things should

00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
be going, to settle
into, allowing the wisdom

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%
that we already have to arise.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And to let the intuition
come and start to guide us.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And we have to slow down.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Have to slow down.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got to be still.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.498 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: In order
for that to come.

00:29:58.498 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, with
the yes comes the no.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Absolutely,
they go together.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have to say
no to things that you

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
know will not work out,
even if you think they will.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.784 align:middle line:90%
That's a big piece.

00:30:10.784 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It is, and it's
that boundary piece that we

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:90%
were talking about earlier.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I love this when I heard this--

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
anytime you're saying no,
you're saying yes to yourself.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes is so good.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And to learn
how to practice no,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
without justifying, without
making this huge, like err!

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Just no, it's a no.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
say why it's a no.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:84%
You give yourself
permission to say no.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.002 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
uncomfortable probably

00:30:40.002 --> 00:30:40.835 align:middle line:90%
through the process.

00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.614 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So that's that place
of not abandoning yourself.

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Because what most of us do
is we try the new thing,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:90%
it's uncomfortable.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, oh, never
mind, that's not going to work,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm upsetting them.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.609 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, we have
abandoned ourselves

00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of what's actually true for us.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We abandon our no.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: We abandon our no.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So staying with, I say no, I
feel guilty, I feel scared,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel upset, I
feel like nobody's

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:90%
going to love me anymore.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And then just be
with that feeling,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:84%
just open around it,
like, hi, sweetie.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm constantly like, hi sweetie.

00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Getting comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I associate
being uncomfortable with,

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't care.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care
isn't the same thing

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
as sitting with being
uncomfortable with not

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:22.850 align:middle line:90%
being liked.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:23.761 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, yes.

00:31:23.761 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big distinction there.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and then
staying with yourself.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Sweetie, everyone might not
like you in this moment,

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
but I like you, I'm right
here, I know this is scary.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.237 align:middle line:84%
If we change the
self talk, that's

00:31:35.237 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
what's the most critical,
because most of us

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
are so judgmental and
harsh towards ourselves

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.660 align:middle line:90%
of how we speak.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I look at pioneers
like Oprah and many other women

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that if they sat there
and said, oh, I'm

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
not OK with being a pioneer,
I don't think I'd do this,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll just be small,
we wouldn't have

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
half the things that
these wonderful women have

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:90%
paved for us.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
doesn't serve any one

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to be acquiescent, although
you don't need to be aggressive

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:90%
in order to do it.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.235 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Correct, correct.

00:32:07.235 --> 00:32:08.035 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: There is a way that you
can be absolutely open-hearted,

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:84%
present, compassionate,
listening to someone,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.295 align:middle line:90%
and saying no.

00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's
talk about control.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
When women or even men want
to control a situation,

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
does it usually mean that
they're out of control

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.245 align:middle line:90%
with something in themselves?

00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:31.675 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Often, and there's
a feeling of not being safe.

00:32:31.675 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So whenever we do
something like controlling--

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.301 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
four strategies,

00:32:36.301 --> 00:32:39.320 align:middle line:84%
controlling, pleasing,
isolating, and distracting.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And controlling and
pleasing are similar,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because we're pleasing
to control things.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But that place of I need
to control other people,

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I need to control my environment
is because we don't feel safe.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So the moment that you
have compassion for yourself

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:59.340 align:middle line:84%
of, I'm not feeling safe
right now, OK, I am safe,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.074 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to fix the
world, the world is just fine.

00:33:03.074 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I just need to come
back into the moment

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what do I
need to feel safe in here.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what about the last
time you felt that and you felt

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:90%
you were safe, and you weren't?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
happened a lot.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It happened a lot.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and to not
then stack those all together,

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:90%
to not go back--

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I call it disaster mind.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look back and
grab all the other places I

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
wasn't safe to prove that,
see, I'm not safe now.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Instead of just
going, what do I need now.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.854 align:middle line:84%
The past is past, and of
course it's going to inform,

00:33:36.854 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
but there's a
difference between--

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inform is a good word.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Saying that's
what's happening now

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and really saying,
what's true now,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.930 align:middle line:90%
what's actually happening now.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a skill set
to start to separate out

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:90%
the past from the present.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And not
bring it forward.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And not
bring it forward.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.718 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lot of what
you're talking about here

00:33:54.718 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is practice, doing it
over and over again.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Practicing not saying I'm
sorry, practicing being safe

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.149 align:middle line:84%
and not attaching
it to the past.

00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of repetition.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.606 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It's a
lot of repetition.

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't think we're
all going to change all of this

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:90%
by hearing one interview.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to do
this over and over again.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I've learned
to love obstacles.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
When an obstacle arises,
to be, like, hello,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.181 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where the power is.

00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:20.389 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You go right into it?

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.194 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yep.

00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Not always, sometimes I'm
like, no, I don't want to.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.962 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: But I've trained myself
now to go towards the obstacle,

00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where the energy is,

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.520 align:middle line:84%
that's where the healing is,
that's where the strength is

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.575 align:middle line:90%
going to be built.

00:34:32.575 --> 00:34:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you push
your own boundaries.

00:34:34.475 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I do.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.984 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you say,
OK, this might not

00:34:36.984 --> 00:34:39.419 align:middle line:84%
be comfortable in the long
run, it's going to be safe.

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:90%
And you go for it.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's that place of
challenging yourself

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
in sweet ways, so
it's very different.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:90%
Most of us have learned force--

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:90%
you have to do it.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.879 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this resistance
that comes up and there's this,

00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.945 align:middle line:84%
But we push ourselves, which is
really different than inviting

00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
ourselves-- come on,
let's try something new,

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
let's challenge ourselves,
let's explore, let's expand.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
in the beginning,

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
women's marches were a
little bit like that,

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:90%
they were forceful.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But in the long run, as the
longer you march and the longer

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.539 align:middle line:84%
that you're on the journey,
it becomes about the community

00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:90%
that you're walking with.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever
done a women's march?

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.785 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: A gazillion.

00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.120 align:middle line:90%
You led them?

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are they
great experiences?

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.266 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Really
great experiences.

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
been so many lately.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.075 align:middle line:84%
And in the face of the
whole Me Too Movement,

00:35:32.075 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:84%
if we could talk about
that for a little bit,

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
of these of women who
are really speaking up.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the ones that
we see on TV, it's many women.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:84%
My question for you is, is it a
matter of not having boundaries

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and we let these things
happen because we didn't know,

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't wrong?

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Or was it really that men just
didn't know how to treat women?

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.875 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happened?

00:35:57.875 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's such a mix.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases,
it's women that

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like they could
stand up for themselves.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
built into the culture,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
like if you don't
let this happen,

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.650 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to have a job.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And so it's built in.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of very,
very difficult choices.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where did that start?

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I just
think that anytime

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:84%
you have an imbalance
of power, which

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:84%
we have with men and women, that
there is then the people that

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%

like they have the right

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.612 align:middle line:90%
to take whatever they want.

00:36:32.612 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
aren't in power

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.445 align:middle line:84%
think, well, in order for me
to get ahead I have to give,

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:90%
even if I don't want to.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
was more old school.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
such a resurgence

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of compassionate
men, of men that are

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:90%
extremely sensitive to women.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And they love women and wouldn't
take advantage of women.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of
those men get coupled

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:59.935 align:middle line:84%
into that bad guy, a predator,
and it is not fair to men.

00:36:59.935 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It's a
challenging time,

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to be
really black or white,

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.640 align:middle line:90%
the way our minds work.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.889 align:middle line:84%
And so we're like, either
they're good or they're bad.

00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:11.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like there are some
men that are consciously

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:90%
preying on women.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.080 align:middle line:84%
There are some men that
are just unconscious

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and don't realize what
their actions are doing.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: There are some
men that are very, very,

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
like I will never
cross a boundary.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.804 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And are
actually holding

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:84%
themselves back because they're
so scared to cross a boundary.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.095 align:middle line:90%
So there's this whole range.

00:37:27.095 --> 00:37:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And we have
to realize and really

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:84%
listen to each of the different

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.000 align:middle line:84%
like it's all one
thing, because it's not,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:90%
it's very complicated.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.686 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I read an article about
the workplace, NBC, I think

00:37:39.686 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
was a major studio,
and they were

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
talking about how men relate
to women in the workplace now.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't like having
one-on-one conversations

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.879 align:middle line:90%
with women any longer.

00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
They won't have a
conversation with a woman

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:84%
unless there's another
female present.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.453 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's no
hugging, there's nothing.

00:37:53.453 --> 00:37:56.279 align:middle line:84%
And there's got to be a new
definition now of how to be.

00:37:56.279 --> 00:37:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: There really is.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I think both
sexes are both terrified

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.102 align:middle line:84%
to speak to each other,
because in the workplace

00:38:02.102 --> 00:38:03.560 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what the rules are.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's rewritten them.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.351 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Nobody's
rewritten them yet, yeah.

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:07.985 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
would you rewrite?

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: What I would
rewrite is actually

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
educating every single person
on the planet around consent

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.405 align:middle line:90%
and what consent actually is.

00:38:15.405 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It's the
really clear respect

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and honoring of somebody
else's boundaries

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and not assuming that you know
what their boundaries are,

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
but that you're willing to ask.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And that there's an
incredible clarity of I

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
respect your space,
you respect my space,

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.665 align:middle line:90%
and that we then negotiate that.

00:38:34.665 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we, I think,
have to take responsibility.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As well to
not confuse men,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.769 align:middle line:90%
and not to confuse ourselves.

00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And I think
as women we have

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to be really responsible
for what are our boundaries

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and what are the messages
that we're giving.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And as men, men need to be also
really respectful of no means

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.215 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:38:55.215 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Choose, compare.

00:39:04.815 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: This is again
perpetuating the problem.

However, it's extremely
acceptable in the younger

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.135 align:middle line:90%
generation.

00:39:15.135 --> 00:39:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Extremely.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:90%
It is, it is.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So how do we educate?

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.165 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: We educate by
getting comfortable with being

00:39:22.165 --> 00:39:22.965 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:39:22.965 --> 00:39:23.565 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:23.565 --> 00:39:25.148 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I mean,
that's a piece of it.

00:39:25.148 --> 00:39:27.784 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And also, they might
be perfectly fine with that.

00:39:27.784 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:90%
That's consent, right?

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly, exactly.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's OK.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And knowing what
our yes and our no is.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
No, a handshake
might be comfortable,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.760 align:middle line:90%
and, no, a hug might not be.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And if we know that the
hug is uncomfortable,

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
we're just like, no, I'm
not wanting to hug, period.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's no, well,
I'll hug because I'm

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:84%
going to look like I'm
not being kind, that we

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.660 align:middle line:90%
know what our boundaries are.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.785 align:middle line:90%
And that does change as well.

00:39:50.785 --> 00:39:51.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:39:51.585 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So we
honor where we are,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.921 align:middle line:90%
not where we think we should be.

00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a big
thing that women-- again, we

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:90%
abandon ourselves.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we think, well, I
should be able to do this,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:84%
or I should not have to
have this boundary here.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And that we change.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when we stay
with ourselves,

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:84%
we're able to say, oh, right
now this feels really good.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, but this doesn't.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And that we can communicate
it really, really clearly.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think there because of
this huge backlash with the Me

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Too Movement absolutely
voices need to be heard.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So without being able to define
every single conversation out

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
there that men and
women have, it's

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.920 align:middle line:84%
a matter of taking
personal responsibility

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.176 align:middle line:84%
for what feels good for you,
and not to make something up

00:40:36.176 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:90%
that isn't happening.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.133 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:38.133 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.675 align:middle line:84%
What about the feeling of women
feeling like they were fraud?

00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:45.157 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.157 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to do this?

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.790 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Who am I?

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.385 align:middle line:84%
That whole thing, where
does that come from?

00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Again, because women
have been trained that we're

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:90%
not as valuable as men.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If you look 50 years
ago, the difference

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.552 align:middle line:84%
between a boy and a girl
in a family, the boy

00:41:06.552 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
was the one that was going
to become the breadwinner,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and the girl was the servant.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Right?

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it that
way, not too long ago.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:90%
We're still carrying that.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.439 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
still absolutely

00:41:17.439 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:90%
exists in other cultures.

>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.976 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You grew up in Asia.

00:41:19.976 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, that
seriously exists there.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And it still exists
inside of us,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:84%
even though it looks like
we're more equal now--

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:90%
we are more equal now.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
No doubt, we've done
so much good work.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%

America, though.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.477 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But other cultures
are absolutely fine with it.

00:41:34.477 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we're not here
to make anyone wrong.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Right.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I'm making peace
right now in the world.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really thinking
about the traditions

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that women want to
keep in other cultures.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.950 align:middle line:10%
And I don't want to
make that wrong, where

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:10%
if a woman's place is to
keep a family together

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:10%
and they make sacrifices
to do that in order

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:10%
to hold on to
tradition, and that's

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.299 align:middle line:10%
the choice, that is a choice.

00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, beautiful.

Yeah, I really,
really agree with you.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We have to be very careful
not to put our point-of-view

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:84%
onto other cultures and say,
everyone should be this way.

we are American women.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have a history in
this culture of America

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have become
resilient to.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.004 align:middle line:90%
And it's redefined for us.

00:42:23.004 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It is not necessarily,
and we have

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.782 align:middle line:84%
a lot of international viewers,
so it's not necessarily

00:42:26.782 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:90%
like that for everyone.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: At the
same time, though,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.302 align:middle line:84%
every woman can in their own
way be a warrior goddess.

00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:36.135 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:42:36.135 --> 00:42:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right?

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: There's no external
definition of you're

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.060 align:middle line:84%
a good warrior goddess
if you do it this way.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It's an internal, your
relationship with yourself.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that
commitment, 100%, I'm here,

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm open
and I'm receptive,

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:90%
that's internal work.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you
heard the concept

00:42:58.056 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of the universe being more of
the rise of the feminine right

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:84%
now and the ascension
of the feminine?

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if that's
happening universally?

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we talk
about the universe.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I think it is
happening universally.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're balancing
things out right now,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.512 align:middle line:84%
and I think
sometimes, because we

00:43:20.512 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
do tend to be so black
or white, it's like, OK,

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:90%
now women need to be in power.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:29.250 align:middle line:84%
No, we need to
have women's voices

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:34.770 align:middle line:84%
as part of the whole buffet of
life, and women's viewpoints.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a lot of ways
that women have been shut out

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of sharing their viewpoint
and their perspective,

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
which is really
incredibly valuable.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're bringing that
now to find the equality.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes the rise
of the feminine universal.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Could we talk about something
that you're an expert at,

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:90%
which is time management?

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Why are women not experts at it?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Because we want to
say yes to everything, often.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.524 align:middle line:84%
I know that was my
issue, is that I

00:44:05.524 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted to say yes to everything
and please everybody and--

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take multiple jobs.

00:44:09.064 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And take multiple
jobs and say always.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And to make boundaries
was just excruciating.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I learned is there
was a point in my life

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
where I had
everything I wanted--

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I had written a book, I
had an amazing community,

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I was in a great
relationship, and I was nuts.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was just so
overextended and burnt out.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it looked
like you had it all.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, it looked
like I had it all.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, something's
wrong, something's wrong.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
If I have all of these
things that I've been wanting

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and I can't enjoy them.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you're not happy.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I'm not happy.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So actually I closed
the center down

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that I had, I went on
the road for a year,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and just let everything
go for a while,

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.051 align:middle line:84%
and started this quest
of how do we change our--

00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
how do I change,
it's very personal,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.830 align:middle line:84%
how do I change my
relationship to time.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Because my relationship
to time was wrong,

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.760 align:middle line:84%
it was off is what I
felt. Because I believe

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.074 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't enough, and
I had to do everything,

00:45:05.074 --> 00:45:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to be perfect
at everything.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Had to do it all.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:90%
So what did you do instead?

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.006 align:middle line:84%
What is your new
relationship with time?

00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's so fun.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:84%
What I recognized is part of it
was this linear, da da da da.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I started
learning is that when

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.330 align:middle line:84%
we're clear about what
I call our true work is,

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.160 align:middle line:84%
what we're clear
about what we're here

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to bring or to
experience, and I'll

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:84%
talk about that
more in a second,

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.894 align:middle line:84%
that we then go back
into the cycles.

00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
beautiful, because you

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.070 align:middle line:84%
get really clear about
what you want and you

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:39.390 align:middle line:84%
listen when it's time to take
action, when it's time to rest.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I am constantly
waiting for signs,

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.290 align:middle line:84%
whereas before I
would've been like,

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:43.085 align:middle line:90%
I just have to take action.

00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:43.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:43.885 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Now I'm like, I
don't know, let me wait.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And the information will come.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And things just happen
in such a different way.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.850 align:middle line:90%
There is an effort.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And they do happen.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Is this how you manifest things?

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yep.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It just happens.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It just happens.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And the flow now is
so different than how

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.322 align:middle line:84%
I was in relationship with time
before, because I just trust.

00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of time.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you
opened it all up.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Although you still
have places to be and--

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.445 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:46:12.445 --> 00:46:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Workshops.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.893 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:46:13.893 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And things like that.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.219 align:middle line:84%
So in your workshops,
you do a firework, right?

00:46:17.219 --> 00:46:18.018 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:46:18.018 --> 00:46:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that?

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's the best.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So I learned fire
walking 30 years ago.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And we build a big fire, and
then I teach people about fear,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.310 align:middle line:84%
how to use fear as energy,
how to not use fear

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:84%
to stop themselves, but
actually use it as a resource.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
The fire burn down to coals,
and then I take people out

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.890 align:middle line:90%
and walk them across.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's optional,
whoever wants to walk.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But what's so lovely
about fire walking

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.830 align:middle line:84%
is it's an instantaneous
transformation.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
first agreements

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.139 align:middle line:84%
we've learned as
kids is fire is hot.

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, of course.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.888 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So the moment
you watch somebody

00:46:51.888 --> 00:46:56.130 align:middle line:84%
walk across 1,300 degree
coals, that agreement changes.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:84%
You're suddenly, like, OK,
wait a minute, what else

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:90%
am I believing that's not true.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I did if I walk at Tony
Robbins, one of his events.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I really,
really got out of it

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.105 align:middle line:90%
is how to change your state.

00:47:08.105 --> 00:47:08.906 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:47:08.906 --> 00:47:10.071 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it like that.

00:47:10.071 --> 00:47:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You could
do it in an instant.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You can be in complete
fear, and actually there

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.470 align:middle line:90%
was thousands of people there.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.399 align:middle line:84%
And I got all the way up to
the front, and I chickened out.

00:47:18.399 --> 00:47:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went all the way through
to the back of the line.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: All the
way to the line.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.676 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the interesting
thing about that journey

00:47:23.676 --> 00:47:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is that I had to walk
past everyone in order

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:84%
to get back to the
back of the line.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Wow.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that was
my journey, right?

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.521 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: That was your journey.

00:47:31.521 --> 00:47:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What am I thinking?

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So I just got back in line.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:90%
It was so easy.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But I had to go through
this journey of drama

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and this whole thing.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.197 align:middle line:84%
And I realized how many times
I did that in my life and--

00:47:44.197 --> 00:47:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Such a good reflection.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, take a look at
this video of a firewalk.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.154 align:middle line:84%
>>: (SINGING) Earth my

>>AMARA: Most of
my trainings, we

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.030 align:middle line:84%
do Friday night, Saturday,
firewalk Saturday night,

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and then Sunday.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing to watch the
transformation that happens

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.156 align:middle line:90%
in that short amount of time.

00:48:51.156 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On a Sunday, right?

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These guards are
down, and, yes, wide open.

00:48:55.475 --> 00:48:58.099 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, and the women are
like, everybody was a stranger

00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm so connected
to all these women.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what about when you
go back into your daily life,

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.910 align:middle line:84%
is there a protocol that
you can carry with you

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:84%
or a shield you can take with
you to go back into your life

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
so that you won't seep
back into your old ways?

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Yeah, I
always invite women

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to create something physical,
to have a bracelet or a necklace

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
or a ring or something,
some little thing,

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:90%
to remind of the possibility.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because really, what
the firewalk is about

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and the work that
I do is that we're

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.600 align:middle line:84%
not as limited as
we think we are

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.120 align:middle line:90%
and to have an anchor to that.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And to also build community.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.449 align:middle line:90%
That's so critical.

00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could be online
community or whatever.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:39.755 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:49:39.755 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of the women that you
go through the course with.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yeah.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.220 align:middle line:84%
We have a huge
warrior goddess tribe

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.230 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook, which is amazing.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Because like, I'm
struggling with this,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and there will be 100 women
that will say, I'm with you,

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.710 align:middle line:90%

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:54.803 align:middle line:90%

00:49:54.803 --> 00:49:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And then help people change and
move along, which is important.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So what's on the
frontier for you?

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.636 align:middle line:90%
What are you into now?

00:50:03.636 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I'm really delving
into right now truth and intent.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
How to help people and
how to help myself.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.407 align:middle line:84%
Most of us live in
feeling and story,

00:50:15.407 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're bouncing back
and forth between the two.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The story creates the emotion,
the emotion creates a story,

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and we go back and forth.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And to step out of
that and to step

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.480 align:middle line:84%
into the stillness of
being in relationship

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to the truth, which
isn't about words.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about a feeling sense,
a knowing in your body.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And also this idea
of intent, that

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:84%
when we're really clear about
what our intent is, what

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.970 align:middle line:84%
we want to create, and we
hold that and surrender it

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
up and let it go, that we're
in different relationship

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.890 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.875 align:middle line:84%

do this, it's a big move.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you do?

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Just there's so
many pieces with this.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was living
in Harlem, I was

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.582 align:middle line:84%
living in New York
City, which I loved.

00:51:02.582 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to be
moving to Santa Fe.

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:05.664 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
feeling, I'm like,

00:51:05.664 --> 00:51:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not ready to move to
Santa Fe, I'm not ready.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.777 align:middle line:84%
And usually in the
past, I would've

00:51:10.777 --> 00:51:13.110 align:middle line:84%
been like, we're moving,
you've already made the choice.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.568 align:middle line:84%
But I got really quiet, I'm
like, nope, it's just not time,

00:51:15.568 --> 00:51:17.610 align:middle line:90%
there's something else.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up getting really,
really quiet and going,

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:90%
what's true.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.479 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I'm not ready,
and I want my own place.

00:51:23.479 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I ended up buying an Airstream.

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so cool.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's so cool.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So now I have my
own little home.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm on the road all
the time, and I realized,

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I need something

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So it was
a risk in a way,

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's also been
just such a gift.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.340 align:middle line:84%

learned how to navigate

00:51:46.925 --> 00:51:48.426 align:middle line:84%

pictures of that one.

00:51:48.426 --> 00:51:49.716 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: And there's been lots.

00:51:49.716 --> 00:51:51.975 align:middle line:84%

Just in relationship
to the Airstream,

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:84%
which just cracked me
up, is I was unhooking it

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot to chuck
the back of the wheels.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So the whole trailer, as I
unhook it from the truck,

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.240 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing
moves back a foot.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.042 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to grab
at it, like 4,000 pounds.
