00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to be asking
the deeper questions: how

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.694 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of mind, time,
space, and matter have changed.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
going to be looking

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
at the art of cheating time,
otherwise known as time travel.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
look at all of this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in the perspective
of quantum physics,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
find out how this

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
applies to our own
personal lives.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is quantum
physicist Fred Allan

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Wolf, also known
as a Dr. Quantum

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
as he's affectionately
called, and he

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
is a way of taking
these abstract topics

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and really bringing them to
a simple way of understanding

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.079 align:middle line:84%
His latest book is called
"Time Loops and Space Twists,"

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we're going
to be talking about today.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.367 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FRED ALLAN WOLF: Thank
you very much, very much.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here Lisa.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm glad you're
here because we are--

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm in for a whole education
today as well as our listeners.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.462 align:middle line:84%
How long have you been
practicing quantum physics?

00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:90%
How do you practice it?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, as
I said, you need

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
to practice it because basically
practicing quantum physics

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is just practicing
one basic thing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we all know, do unto
others as you want them

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
to do onto you because
if you don't, they well.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's basically
the quantum entanglement where

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:90%
we're constantly--

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's it.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:84%
We're all basically entangled
from the Big Bang onwards,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and if what we're
talking about now

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and the new ideas
of physics are true,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
we're entangled
from the future too.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the
future and the present

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and the past are constantly
making us come into being.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
So yes, we have free will.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't have free will.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes we do.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:90%
No we don't.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
On a much larger
scale, it's much more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.174 align:middle line:84%
of a magical light show than
we ever, ever thought possible.

00:01:57.174 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what I really
appreciate about you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
is you take these
complex subjects

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and you bring them to reality.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You make them easy for us
to understand who are not

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
quantum physicist,
but yet we live

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum world
every waking moment,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:90%
every sleeping moment.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So we are now going to
be able to understand

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
what this time, space, and
matter is around us right now.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're
living with matter

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.347 align:middle line:90%
all around us, all around us.

00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, I'll
tell you the secret

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is that if there wasn't
all this stuff, matter,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
all the way around us, everybody
would be able to do everything

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
they wanted instantly, and
it would be effortless,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.353 align:middle line:84%
and everything would
be, oh, wonderful.

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
For four days that's great,
but after an eternity of that,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.545 align:middle line:90%
it's boring, boring.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%
That sounds pretty good to me.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Try it.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
If you get everything
you want, everything you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.414 align:middle line:90%
want all the time--

00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then you'd
be a celebrity.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.587 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --then you actually
don't want anything,

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
everything, so what

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
are you going to do now?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you want something
that's going to challenge you,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
something that's
going to inspire you,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
something that you're going to
have to work towards getting.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
might say God had this--

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Plan.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Great thought.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's make a material
world in which

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
people don't get exactly
what they want instantly.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going to get
into this world in such a way

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
that even I don't get
what I want instantly

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to
forget who I really am.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.495 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that, suddenly
I appeared as Lisa Garr.

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:90%
There she is, god in person.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Fred Alan Wolf, there
he is, god in person.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And every other of the 7
billion or how many people

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
we have on the planet now,
they're all god in disguise,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
none of them realizing that the
reason they're in a material

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
body is because they want to
be able to achieve something

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
in their life other
than just living.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it
more than the mind

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and the ego that
wants to achieve?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's kind
of a cosmic game.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
The game is I want
to achieve, but I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.366 align:middle line:84%
don't want to make
it so easy to achieve

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:12.667 align:middle line:84%
that I have no sense
of accomplishment.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's really
a law in the universe.

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It is a law
in the universe.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The basic law of the universe
is to forget yourself, remember

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.785 align:middle line:84%
To remember yourself,
forget yourself.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in all the spiritual
teachings, they all say this,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and everybody says, what
the heck you talking about?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And from a quantum
physics point of view,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfectly good
sense as we will find out,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
as we explore in the show
we're doing together.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.578 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into this.

00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:90%
So what does it mean?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.325 align:middle line:90%
Is it really all an illusion?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that
is a good question.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it really all an illusion,
or is it not all an illusion?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to
get into that, we

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
need to talk about not
only is it an illusion,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:90%
but who's fooling who with what?

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
What is the illusion consisting
of, and who's the illusion for?

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, when a magician does
a trick, there's an audience

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:90%
and there's a performer.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.389 align:middle line:84%
And the performer is doing
the trick for the audience.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's observing
the performer.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Now, think of what
you might do with that if you

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
are the performer and the
audience at the same time.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Then you're doing it
in front of a mirror,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that mirrors
and mirror symmetries are

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing we have
discovered in quantum physics

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to
understand, actually,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
how this universe got
created in the first place,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and even how time and
matter get created.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all really
done with mirrors,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's something we
are going to explore.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
So is it all an illusion?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It basically is.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to find out is,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
what's making the
illusion come in?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Who is the illusion for?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's God.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the mind of God.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's your mind.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain the mind of God.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
the white man in the sky.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
from a universal God.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
From a certain perspective, from
a quantum physical, scientific

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of perspective,
which by the way,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%
no scientist would ever say.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Because scientists live
under the Shibboleth thou

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
shalt not ever mention
spiritual or God or religion

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.774 align:middle line:84%
or spirituality
because it's forbidden.

00:06:26.774 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
we're doing this is

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
because 500 years ago,
you were chopping off

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
the heads of scientists,
you religious guys,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want you to
do that anymore to us.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.916 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: They remember.

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: You don't
forget things like that.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So science has been
anti-religious ever since.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the mind
of God is a field

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:90%
which fills the whole universe.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's your mind, and when
you remember who you really are,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
you identify with this field,
which is the mind of God.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And from that point
of view, you project

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
into various activities,
universes, worlds,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
however you want
to play the game.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you remember
who and what you are,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
you could always get out as
well as get back in again.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.832 align:middle line:84%
For those of us living here
on Earth, our 80 to 100

00:07:18.832 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
or 90 to 1,000,
whatever years we're

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be alive on
this planet-- for us,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
for ordinary folk,
we kind of forget it

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
because we get so much
into the day-to-day stuff

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:90%
that we forget that.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.622 align:middle line:84%
So we give ourselves a
gentle reminder, we die.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gentle.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Very gentle.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
We just get out of
here after a while,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
because you get too attached
it, and sometimes life

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.817 align:middle line:84%
can be hard because,
after all, you

00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:90%
are trying to move around mass--

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But as I've heard,
that when you do crossover,

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
from many of the guests who
have sat in this chair here,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that idea of the quantum
field then expands,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
place to live from.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: You know,
expands, contracts,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whatever it does,
you're already there.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The point is that when
you're in body form,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
you're there or you

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
tend to forget you're there
because the ego, which

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is the body-mind, which is
that mind which is telling you,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
don't stick your finger
in the white socket.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.356 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Ah, the light's red.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't cross.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't cross.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't cross.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
That mind, that
body-mind is more--

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
it's concerned with the
survival of the mind

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:90%
within the framework.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The confusion that
comes from that

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
is that, ah, that's
all that it is.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
My mind is some kind of
emergence from the body,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and the body-- you're born,
terrible; you live, terrible;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.276 align:middle line:90%
you die, black.

00:08:48.276 --> 00:08:49.554 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.554 --> 00:08:51.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would be horrible.

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That's basically
the way people think,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and that is-- some people think.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is not only
unpleasant, but it's basically

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
an assumption.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not a basic truth.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not based upon anything
other than our observations

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that we are born,
we live, and we die.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean that
we don't continue in some way

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:90%
We have no proof of that.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.248 align:middle line:84%
We have no way of
identifying that.

00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm trying
to do is explain

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that there has to be mind
present in the universe,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and that means that the
present state of that mind

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.745 align:middle line:84%
in various bodies is capable
of transforming or changing.

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
we're doing today

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to go on this
journey of quantum physics

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.944 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates to our
matter in time and space

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, so-- my favorite
characters as I grew up,

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and I understand some of
you at home watching this

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
may not remember
these characters,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.585 align:middle line:90%
are the Marx brothers.

00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember
the Marx brothers.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And they
were very comical

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.975 align:middle line:84%
because they were always trying
to figure out what to do.

00:09:57.975 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They always had lots of
ideas, and they were always

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
come up with comical
solutions to what goes on.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.322 align:middle line:84%
Harpo was my favorite character
because he didn't speak,

00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
but he was, I
thought, the funniest

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
although Groucho
was certainly funny.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these are
the characters,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
coming up with,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
you might think were
bubbles of possibilities.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want to play with
that idea of bubbles

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities a little bit
in explaining this when we talk

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%
about the time and
mind and quantum

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
bubbles of possibilities,
and what do I mean by that?

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean that basically
quantum physics is telling us

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that the universe doesn't
come into being as one thing.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.928 align:middle line:84%
It comes into being as
many possible universes

00:10:40.928 --> 00:10:41.553 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the latest dope,
and this latest dope, I mean,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
it sounds dopey.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
How can there be more
than one uni-- universe

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
is a singular word.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:90%
How can it be universes?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Call them multiverses
if you want to.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or parallel universes.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Parallel
universes, a book

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.645 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote about
that subject matter.

00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so when we look at
all these possibilities,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
we might think about a kid
who's thinking, what am I to do?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So he's pondering, and
thinking, and worrying.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And he gets an idea.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
An idea props,
comes into his head

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly something
begins to emerge in his mind.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And when that thing
emerges, something pops.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.055 align:middle line:84%
And when that thing pops,
we suddenly have, oh--

00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:28.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: An idea.

00:11:28.975 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: An idea, a star, or
twinkle, twinkle little bat,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
how I wonder what you're at.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:38.945 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you write that?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.231 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:45.871 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I'm sure somebody very
clever in the biz wrote that.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And now we
have an idea appearing.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So now I try to map out with
our favorite characters-- there

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.327 align:middle line:84%
actually originally four Marx
brothers-- how this might look.

00:11:56.327 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And how it might look
is that we started out

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
with what I call a
precedent blur, which

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:90%
means many possibilities.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't know which one.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
looking and thinking

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find out
which one is the right one.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly we
have a focal point.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the guys concentrate,
oh, we've got an idea.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.576 align:middle line:84%
A focal point is when something
starts to say, yeah, that's it!

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You get
out of confusion.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
You get into a status.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.038 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Get out of confusion.

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Get out of, let's say, multi
fusion into single fusion,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's rather not a
confusion of different fusions,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
it's really a diffuseness
into an actual fusion event.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we have afterwards
a subsequent blur,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
hang on to anything.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Ideas fly, they flow.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So this represents
what I would call

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:84%
a way of looking at
how the mind works.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that,
in the universe,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
we have these bubbles
of possibilities

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
all over the place and
focal points appearing

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like a light show.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.732 align:middle line:84%
We don't see this
because we're in,

00:12:58.732 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
we're made of that
kind of stuff.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But these are the points, these
are the things that occur,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and every time they
occur with a focal point,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.735 align:middle line:90%
something else starts to emerge.

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We might call it an order, a
sequencing, a reason, a cause

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and effect.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, cause and
effect are what

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:90%
we call in physics causality.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
part of learning

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
to gain control of
what's going on.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how to
control what's going-- ever

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
since the caves when the Ooga
Boogas were outside and were

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.386 align:middle line:84%
getting clobbered
by those guys, we

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
had to learn what are the
tricks to getting control

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.902 align:middle line:84%
over the masses of stuff
that are around us.

00:13:45.902 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is what
happens as you grow up,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.239 align:middle line:84%
you're gaining control
through school of life.

00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens if
you form an organization.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens as you get
on with your life, or married,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just all our attempt
for our mind and the mind--

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:90%
universal mind to gain--

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: --to gain control.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And control means to observe
or to get hold of something

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:90%
we call a temporal order.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
An order of the chaotic
bubbles of possibilities.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to emerge
because of the fact

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that there are focal points that
come in every once in awhile.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at
how that all works,

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:84%
we have a precedent blur,
a focal point, and then

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
we have something
called a posterior blur,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:84%
which isn't as big as
the precedent blur.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it gives
us a temporary or a time order,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
an order of time.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have what I call
a triplet, big blur,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:90%
focal point, small blur.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you, can this
help us form new ideas?

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Could help us go-- let's talk
about going into the past

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.074 align:middle line:90%
and reforming--

00:14:59.074 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's coming.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
That's coming up, actually.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: What this is doing
is not forming a new idea,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
it's forming an idea based
upon your experience.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you first
get on to ride a bicycle.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Your precedent blur is, I'm all
over the place with my bike,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:90%
but then you focal point.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Hey, that worked.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
precedent blur where you're not

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
making as many errors
as you wiggle on--

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
recalling the past memory

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.034 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to ride
the bike, how not to fall.

00:15:28.034 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's coming later.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
you got on the bike.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
You have no memory of
riding the bike yet.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:90%
You just go, oh my god.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.735 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, you
peddle, focal point.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got the bike and then,
oh, now I can relax a little bit

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and ride the bike.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that, oh,
it's OK to fall a little bit

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.413 align:middle line:84%
to the right or a
little bit the left.

00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, in fact, I do fall to the
right or left when I stir.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:90%
So now you begin learning bike.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And learning bike
is just a question

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of playing with these triplets.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
This is all the
learning experience.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
This is all the
ordering experience.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
This is all going
forward in time.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we go from
children to adolescents

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to adults who constantly is
going from the precedent blur,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
to the focal point,
to the posterior blur.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the quantum physics
explanation of life.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That basically is
what we do when we learn,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's not all of it
because if-- you see,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
after a certain point,
you don't want-- I mean,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
you start to forget stuff,
or at a certain point,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
you want to learn new stuff.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And the old stuff
might get in the way.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you're
taught that the only way

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:84%
to handle your spouse is to
yell to get what you want,

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
then you find that when
you're in the office,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:90%
you yell to get what you want.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.745 align:middle line:84%
When you go home, you
yell what you could-- You

00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:48.369 align:middle line:84%
yell at your children,
and finally, you

00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
have this thing that you learned
because your parents maybe

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
yelled at you when
you were growing up

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
because that way you
behaved and so forth.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:90%
So you become a yeller.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the best way
to handle people, is it?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn
how to forget that.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So there is another
possible-- there's

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:84%
another way in which order
can-- I call it de-merge

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than emerge,
it de-merges.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You start to lose
touch with that order.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So a study of a precedent
blur, which is maybe small,

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
then a focal point, and
then a posterior blue,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
which is larger, which
means at this point,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
you have fewer
possibilities merging

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:90%
into more possibilities.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we start to fine
tune what it is that we want.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.949 align:middle line:84%
I would not say fine
tune, it's de-tune.

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:38.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: De-tune.

00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: De-tune.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Let go of everything
you thought you knew.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.025 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --in order to
do something different.

00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're an actor,
for example, and you're

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.589 align:middle line:84%
asked to play a female
when you're a male,

00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
you've got to let go of
whatever you thought a male is.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But that happens
everywhere in life

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:84%
where you have to let
go of old patterns.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: You've got to learn
to let go of the old patterns

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
in order to learn the new ones.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the old proverb of the
glass half full and half empty.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
People that don't let
go always have a glass

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
which is one way or the other.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I forgot which way is
considered one way or the other.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We're all half empty.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Let's say the
half-filled people are

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the ones that hold on
because they can only

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:90%
take so much more water in.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.613 align:middle line:84%
But the half empty people
realize, oh, there's

00:18:24.613 --> 00:18:26.175 align:middle line:90%
a lot more water I can add.

00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:27.521 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It might be the reverse.

00:18:27.521 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Who knows?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I get those two
confused all the time.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because your
glass is always full.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:31.961 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The whole point is
empty the glass completely

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in order to let in new stuff.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love how you
fine tune what I'm saying.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I love it because you really
do think about these things.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
How did you even get
into quantum physics?

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
What sparked your
curiosity around it?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.175 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Magic.

00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:49.805 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Magic.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
You see, as a child,
I matured very early.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
At nine years old, I
realized there was sex.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.165 align:middle line:90%
That is early.

00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That's pretty
early, but I also

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:90%
developed a very strange thing.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I began stammering so badly
that my mother thought

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
something had gone
wrong with my brain

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
as a result of early
sexual maturation.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you have
older brothers or sisters?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.005 align:middle line:90%
I was the oldest.

00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So my mom took me
first-- I grew up

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago-- she took me
to Northwestern University

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to see if they want to
drill in my head to let out

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
brain pressure or
something like that.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And my mom said no to that.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I finally learned--
I finally got

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
ahold of a speech
teacher-- or my mother

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
took me to one who taught
me meditation, breathing

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and watching your
breath, in and out.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At what age?

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.122 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: 10.

00:19:52.122 --> 00:19:52.955 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: 11.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.899 align:middle line:90%
12.

00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So I began to learn
this sort of stuff,

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and then what I would do to
improve my speaking skill

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is I would practice doing
magic in front of a mirror.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.967 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I would stand in
front of the mirror--

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How would that
help your speaking?

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Because when you do a
magic trick, you gotta talk.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
In magic, they call it patter.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And often magicians think
of patter as being useless,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:90%
unh-uh.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Being a magician is like
being a one-act play.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:90%
You are the whole thing.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not only the
presenter of the data

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
or the thing which is the
story which is being told,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:90%
you're acting it out.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
You're the stage.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You're the props
because your props are

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the cards or the things or
whatever you're manipulating,

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:90%
but if you ain't talking,

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, some magicians do that.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They just do all visual,
and they're fine.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's like
watching a mime perform.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to be really
good in order to do that.

00:20:54.645 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well you
just got to remember

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that you've got everybody's
focus on just what you're

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
doing visually, but if
you're a performer who

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
does what I call magic,
you've got to use your voice.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
The voice is everything.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you have a good
way of presenting your trick,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.447 align:middle line:84%
people remember different
things about the trick

00:21:16.447 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that have nothing to do with the
way you really did the trick.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you obviously
got over your stammering.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Took me a while,
and I still am a stammerer,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
but I-- in fact, you
can find me stammering

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
under certain
occasions that arise,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
but I found out ways to do it.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So actually, in a
way, I definitely

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.135 align:middle line:84%
have improved my
speaking ability

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because now I'm
a public speaker.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.843 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're a presenter,
and you're a phenomenal one.

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:41.967 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And you have-- look what you do.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.662 align:middle line:84%
You take the complex
and you make it simple,

00:21:45.662 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's basically what
you did in your life.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I never knew that.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful
thing about it is

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that you healed something and
then became a teacher of it.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to realize that,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that I did a little
kind of history

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of all of the
so-called greats that

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:90%
have ever appeared in life.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:90%
By greats, I mean great actors--

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Leaders.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --presidents,
leaders, basketball players.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I just recently found
out that Shaq O'Neal

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.144 align:middle line:90%
was a stutterer and stammerer.

00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all of
these people had

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.851 align:middle line:90%
to come over massive adversity.

00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: They all had
to overcome hurdles.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you out there
in the audience

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
are feeling that you can never
be a success because you have

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
this particular
impediment, consider

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
yourself blessed far more
than the guy next door who's

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:90%
got no impediments at all.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He should go find one.

00:22:44.845 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
succeed at doing even

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:84%
what you think is
something you can't

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:84%
do because of the impediment,
I want to tell you you can.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
your impediment is,

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
able to overcome it.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking from experience.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a speaker.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I overcome stammering,
psychological problems.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:90%
You can overcome it.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you tie in
quantum physics to that?

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that's where
the story gets started.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It gets started with
magic because magic

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:90%
is in front of a mirror.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to wonder about--
I mean, I began to wonder,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and that's the next thing.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I began to wonder about.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And once I started to
wonder about how things are,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I began to wonder, what is
this thing called light?

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And just thinking about
light got me into physics.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at all
the college curricula

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I could take when I
went to university,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and nothing interested
me as much as physics,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:84%
because in physics
I was learning

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
the magic of how
the universe works.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I was learning
how the tricks are performed.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think of God as a
great performing magician.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And so-- and then
all of us are the audience,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:84%
but we're also the
performer-- we're also

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the magicians,
performers themselves.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're the observer and
the performer at the same time.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: And the observed.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:90%
The same time.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.126 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The observer
and observed.

00:24:12.126 --> 00:24:16.657 align:middle line:84%
So light gets us into
the concept of-- now

00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
this is where we get
into the physics of it.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Yes, and we're
going to come up on that.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So let-- just let
me briefly-- should

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I go briefly through
the rest of this?

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh,no, take your time.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:90%
We love the details.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So we're back to
looking at this whole thing

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
about letting go, and what that
means is your precedent blur is

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
smaller than your
posterior blur,

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
in other words, what came
before is pretty well defined,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
but what came after
is less well defined.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:90%
You're letting go.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:90%
You're letting go.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And letting go is
a remarkable thing

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that everybody should learn
because you can't focus

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:90%
unless you let go to begin with.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
important part.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Letting go and focusing,
there is a dance

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go through,
and you have the intent and will

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So here's a kind of a picture
of what this might look like,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
a sequence of events
in which somebody

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
is learning to do something,
and as the sequence goes

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
on from a beginning
blur of possibilities

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and to focal points and then
less and less possibilities,

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
we're really learning
and we're striving

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to become an expert
at something.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:90%
This is called mastery.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:84%
This is what mastery looks
like as far as your-- learning

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
your mind, how your mind works.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.026 align:middle line:90%
Quantum physics.

00:25:42.026 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is mind
mastery, so it's basically

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
how we understand our
developmental stages.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
You can take this
from a macro view,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can look at the
evolutionary biology,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
or you can take it
from a micro view

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and look at your own personality
and your own evolution.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:58.865 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:25:58.865 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is how it goes
from a blur, to the focus,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to something that's less
controlled but solid.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Actually,
just the opposite.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going into more
and more control.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would say
is the story of evolution.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual- we're
going to get to the other way.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:90%
That's going the other way.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Getting from more possibility
to less possibility

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%
is becoming an expert.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:90%
So we're going that way in time.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what you do when you
learn to do something well.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.175 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this
picture is showing us.

00:26:32.175 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how does this
relate to time travel?

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that's
coming up too.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a matter of how
fast you want to go here.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
These are-- I'm just
showing triplets

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that recognize the different
aspects of-- but we

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:90%
don't need to go through that.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:90%
ok, now, here's something else.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Here we're doing what you
just were talking about,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:90%
it's the letting go process.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We're starting out from
something we know is true.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
By golly, this is the absolute
truth, to I don't know.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure it's true.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when we say, oh, I
used to believe such and such,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and I used to think this way.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.074 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that is.

00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That's
just the letting go

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of what you know is the
truth to, hey, wait a minute.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it isn't true.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what I've been
thinking all along is wrong.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a letting
go process, which

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
is vital to life as much as
the learning to do something

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and mastering something.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the de-mastering
process, the letting go,

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
because without this process,
you cannot possibly learn

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:90%
the other which is to master.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
the way I've got,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:84%
it since we're
going backwards, I

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
look at it as a
backward flow in time.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is almost
a time reversal.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going from
very well defined

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
into not so well defined.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
One might argue about whether
this is really time reversal

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
or not, and it's
really not important

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
as long as one realizes
that it's the reversal

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
process of the
expertise or learning

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to become an expert
at something.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And finally here we're
looking at a sequence

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.189 align:middle line:84%
of events in which
we're pretty well

00:28:15.189 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:84%
convinced we know what
we're talking about.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We're getting what
was not so well known

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
is getting more and more
well known as time goes on,

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.622 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
would say is becoming

00:28:25.622 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
an expert at something.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Gaining
control of your life.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Gaining
control of your life.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's just
pause for a second

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.390 align:middle line:84%
here and let me ask you a
couple of questions about this.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.931 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Sure.

00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does this relate
to re-forming past experiences

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:84%
that happened to our life, say,
for example, childhood trauma,

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.560 align:middle line:84%
death of a loved
one, things that we

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to move
on from that cause pain.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:84%
How do you take this theory
of subspace time realms

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and heal past wounds?

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.075 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, healing is
he letting go process.

00:28:58.075 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
When you cut yourself,
in order to heal,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the skin has to look
at possibilities

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:90%
to form what's healing.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It can't just--

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.045 align:middle line:90%
It's not an automatic thing.

00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:12.715 align:middle line:90%
It's not like fixing your car.

00:29:12.715 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's not.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's not.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.259 align:middle line:84%
If you make a dent in a
car, it just stays dented.

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Until you fix it.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Until you fix it.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you heal
your body, it's

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:84%
looking for the
various possibilities

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and moving towards an order, so
it has to, in a certain sense,

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.755 align:middle line:90%
let go of the old pattern.

00:29:29.755 --> 00:29:31.487 align:middle line:84%
The old pattern was
there was cut there.

00:29:31.487 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Ah, but now there's a cut there.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.153 align:middle line:90%
I got to do something different.

00:29:34.153 --> 00:29:35.367 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To regain.

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The pattern which
holds the skin together is not

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.235 align:middle line:84%
the pattern which brings
a cut into healing.

00:29:40.235 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the new
pattern that does.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: A new
pattern has to form.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
A scar tissue has
to form, something

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't there
before has to form.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing happens--
we'll get more into-- it's

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
more-- we'll get
more into it later,

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
but it has to do with
what we call memory

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and what memories are and
how we bring memories out.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a remarkable
film that Woody Allen made.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the best
work of his genius

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.881 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen,
"Midnight in Paris."

00:30:08.881 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.052 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:10.052 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: I love this movie.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.154 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:30:13.154 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's a quantum
physicist, Woody Allen.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, Woody is
a remarkable talent.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:84%
He's a very-- He's always
been a talented guy.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
He's always been
funny, but he's always

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
made us think about stuff,
and he's been timely,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and "Midnight in Paris"
is extremely timely.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The idea that he's
recalling for us

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.740 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever we think
of the good old days,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.909 align:middle line:84%
they always seem better
than what we got now.

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:90%
The best is yet to come.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: God.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.246 align:middle line:90%
The best is yet.

00:30:41.246 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, the best is back there.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, back there is
when they had a good time.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Roaring '20s.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
My god, look at those
guys; they're just

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.257 align:middle line:84%
drinking and dancing and messing
around, having good times

00:30:51.257 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not a care in the world.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, what it would
be like to be in World War

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
II in Paris when Humphrey Bogart
is talking to Ingrid Bergman,

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:05.105 align:middle line:84%
and you know, we try to remember
these things as romantic times.

00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:08.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, always the past periods
or when the great art was

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:90%
being created, and so forth.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:84%
In the movie, Woody takes
us to those time periods

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and shows us that it ain't so
great when you're living it.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.015 align:middle line:84%
Just like as our
current reality is.

00:31:19.015 --> 00:31:20.181 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: You've got problems.

00:31:20.181 --> 00:31:21.439 align:middle line:90%
You've got pimples back there.

00:31:21.439 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.479 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And exactly.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.406 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So whatever
area you're in,

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
problems coming up,

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and when you think back to
what it was in the past,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
you kind of remember
it in a nicer way.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.425 align:middle line:84%
Same thing goes with
your relationships.

00:31:35.425 --> 00:31:36.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: If enough time passes.

00:31:36.875 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: When you think back to
the way it was then, including

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
loved ones that may
have passed, the mind

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
can go into two different
ways of dealing with it.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It could go as that was a
horrible thing that happened

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
or it begin to look at the
blessing and the wonder

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and the magic of what that
relationship brought to you.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying
to get it back,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
just remember it in
the way that, say,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.615 align:middle line:84%
Woody Allen remembers
Paris in the '20s.

00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's quantum
physics-- a quantum physics

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
overview of remembering
past loved ones

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:90%
or reforming traumatic memories.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's letting go of
a fixated pattern

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.553 align:middle line:84%
and remembering the
different possibilities.

00:32:21.553 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you're
recreating your past.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in a sense,
you're creating the past.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We can always look
at old war movies

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and think, oh, well that's
how the Japanese were

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think anybody that
lived through World War II

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:84%
knows that the feelings
you had towards, say,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.294 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese were very
different than the feelings

00:32:47.294 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:90%
you had towards the Germans.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I mean, no
Germans were put

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in concentration camps in
America, but Japanese were.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.795 align:middle line:84%
So Japanese were
considered almost subhuman.

00:32:55.795 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to
remember that we've changed,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:84%
we've recreated that
past where we remember

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
those unpleasant
thoughts, and we should,

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, we
don't look at Japanese people

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:09.737 align:middle line:90%
as being subhuman.

00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in many
ways, we look at them

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.440 align:middle line:84%
as being superior to our
own ways of doing things.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Revered.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
because what you just

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
mentioned has such a practical
application to how we really

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:90%
reform our thoughts.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
When I mentioned earlier
about the ancient art

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.690 align:middle line:90%
of cheating time--

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you really can.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect example,
World War II or Pearl Harbor.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We look back on these
events, and we can literally

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
reform the particles of
matter around those events,

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
correct me if I'm
wrong here, to reform

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:84%
our opinions and our
feelings and our emotions

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
around those events so that
then we can forward-- go forward

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and create new particles
of matter and feelings

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, through
light and time,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.285 align:middle line:84%
to create new feelings
about the events.

00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: In a way you're right.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.607 align:middle line:84%
The question would
be where is that past

00:34:03.607 --> 00:34:04.565 align:middle line:90%
that you're recreating.

00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is, is
it back there somewhere,

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.439 align:middle line:84%
or is it south of Chicago
and north of Dallas?

00:34:15.439 --> 00:34:16.022 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:16.022 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Where exactly is it?

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, where
exactly is it located?

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into that kind
of thinking, you get nowhere.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the mind as being

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.924 align:middle line:84%
the field in which all
things are possible,

00:34:26.924 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:84%
then you can think
of it that way.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you see,
matter-- there is

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:84%
no-- we're going to be
getting into this a little bit

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.290 align:middle line:90%
in this thing, I think.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Matter just isn't stuck there.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
Matter is constantly appearing
and disappearing constantly

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.120 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and
the patterns tend

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
to come in and go
out similarly but not

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:90%
always exactly the same way.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So we will be talking
about that, too.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now we're into
the role of the mind,

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and it basically ties into
what we're talking about now.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing here is
showing in these pictures

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
just that taking--
we're taking-- we're

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:84%
zooming out of all these
different possibilities.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And it begins almost to
even look like a DNA code.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.320 align:middle line:84%
In a certain sense, we're
looking at the structures

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.404 align:middle line:84%
which arise even in DNA
from all these poppings

00:35:15.404 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and whatever going on.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:84%
This is more or less a
quantum mechanical picture,

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, if
we keep zooming back,

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
zooming back, zooming
back, eventually

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
we realize that what
we're looking at

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.164 align:middle line:90%
is the whole human race.

00:35:28.164 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
The whole human race
is being looked at.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing everything as
it is-- and even ourselves.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We are the forms which allow
this kind of picture to arise.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're really looking
at the more global phenomenon

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics in
this particular case.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I think we
always have been,

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and what quantum
physics is helping us--

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I got so excited
about teaching quantum physics

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to people who are not scientists
at all is that it provides

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:84%
a much stronger
metaphorical base,

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
a language structure in
which we can renegotiate

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.170 align:middle line:84%
our relationships with others,
that we can learn that it's OK

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to give up the old thinking
and look at some new ways

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of thinking to help us deal with
the problems that we're going

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
to be facing as
we face 7 billion,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
maybe more people on the planet
learning how to re-resource,

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%
learning how to--

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Energy.

00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --re-change
our concept of what

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is-- why we have to kill each
other rather than maybe there's

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:90%
another way.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting,
because if we could just

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:84%
get our global leaders to think
more like this, because they're

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
so ingrained in either
the monetary structures

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:90%
around energy and oil and gas.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Greed gets involved.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's the old way
based upon survival, based

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:84%
upon that we have to have these
things in order to survive,

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and if we cut those
things off, we

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.505 align:middle line:84%
won't be able to survive
like we're used to surviving.

00:37:00.505 --> 00:37:02.155 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.155 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
will happen in our lifetime?

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.805 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I think
it's happening now.

00:37:06.805 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In certain pockets.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.915 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And it's going
to continue to happen.

00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is a process
which will continue,

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm part of that process,
and the other teachers

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that you've had on this program
are part of that process,

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're continuing to keep
getting the message out.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
that Gaiam TV helps

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:84%
producing such
information for people

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:90%
other than the usual thing.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The GATE 2 was bringing together
movie makers and script writers

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and the whole Hollywood
scene in order

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to let them know that there
are other ways to do it,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and as the bottom line
suitors would say,

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
there's money to
made here, guys.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's always
the bottom line.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But that was the Global
Alliance of Transformational

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment,
and that is what--

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of different
sectors like that where there

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:84%
are transformational
movements, but this

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.790 align:middle line:84%
has existed since
the '60s, the '70s.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have
constantly been

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to achieve this
level of enlightenment.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It's in different genres
in different ways.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Are we getting more evolved?

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.025 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting any
closer, or are we

00:38:18.025 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:84%
just recreating the same
story over and over?

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well,
there's always going

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to be re-creation
over and over again.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:84%
There are always going
to be pockets of that.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As we've just
learned through that concept.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.909 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's the way it works.

00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once we've learned
something that we've-- once

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
you've learned that
if I'm an Israeli,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I may not like the people
that live in that country,

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
or if I live in that country,
I may not like the Israelis.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.340 align:middle line:84%
If I'm an Iranian, I'm
worried about-- if we

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
have certain ways of
thinking going on our head,

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
we may tend to see the
world as the enemy.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
transformations going on.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.060 align:middle line:90%
The web has made that possible.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.820 align:middle line:84%
No longer is war hidden
from us, and once people

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.779 align:middle line:90%
see the horror of war--

00:39:05.779 --> 00:39:06.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is true.

00:39:06.653 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --like what's going
on in Syria right now,

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
transformation
starts to take place.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.855 align:middle line:90%
It's going on a lot faster.

00:39:11.855 --> 00:39:13.855 align:middle line:84%
People don't think it's
fast because they seldom

00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:84%
see the horrors of Syria,
but it's much faster now

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.529 align:middle line:84%
that people are taking
pictures on cell phones.

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Time does appear to be speeding
up because of the internet,

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and there are less things
that are covered up

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.984 align:middle line:84%
now because of the
exposure on the internet.

00:39:27.984 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Can't cover
it up anymore.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes there's
too much information,

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.304 align:middle line:84%
so you don't know what
to believe any longer,

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:36.377 align:middle line:84%
but it is up to-- that's why
I'm all about empowering people

00:39:36.377 --> 00:39:38.418 align:middle line:84%
to find their own truth
in it because you know it

00:39:38.418 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:90%
when you hit it.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to continue our
conversation on how this all

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.160 align:middle line:90%
relates to us on a global scale.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
understand this is, again,

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:90%
the macro and micro.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at our individual
stages of development as people

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.975 align:middle line:84%
and where we go through
our adolescence, adulthood,

00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:90%
and where we go into our life.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.280 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
global perspective

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:84%
on how we are as an evolution
and our society evolves

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at this
in terms of the future

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:84%
as well because this
absolutely impacts our future.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to always make sure what
you're talking about applies

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:84%
to reality because we
could get way out there

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
in our conversations
in a very esoteric way.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.615 align:middle line:90%
But I absolutely love it.

00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:16.798 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Who me?

00:40:16.798 --> 00:40:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Get way out there?

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.452 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dr. Quantum.

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Dr. Quantum
is always here.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's great though
because you think like this,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and you also bring
it back into reality.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: I hope so.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I absolutely
appreciate it.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's my job.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.310 align:middle line:90%
It's my job.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we're going
to get back with that.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to continue
to bring these quantum

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:84%
concepts into reality when we
come back with Fred Alan Wolf.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:84%
My guest is quantum physicist
Fred Alan Wolf, otherwise known

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:45.890 align:middle line:90%
as Dr. Quantum.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the field--
the idea of time speeding up,

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field theory,
time moving faster than light.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get on to
the meaty stuff right now.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.980 align:middle line:90%
What is matter, really?

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.575 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Well, in the beginning--

00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:01.612 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.612 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were there?

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.600 align:middle line:90%
We were all there.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.300 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, there wasn't
matter, there wasn't space,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't time.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:90%
What was there?

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's kind of a mystery.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly there was something
called the big-- the Big Bang.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And then matter, space, and
time all came into existence

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.420 align:middle line:90%
supposedly at once.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've
learned from physics

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't have any
of those without the other.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.405 align:middle line:84%
Can't have time without
space and matter.

00:41:37.405 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Can't have matter
without time and space.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Can't have space
without time and matter.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They are a twining,
triplicate twining, a braid.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You, though, then bring
God into this whole thing,

00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:51.365 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, that
was before this

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.915 align:middle line:84%
all kind of big
banged into existence.

00:41:55.915 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But you do yourself.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
You're a quantum physicist
that brings together

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.315 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and
science and physics.

00:42:03.315 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, in a way this
is kind of like a story

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:84%
because, you see,
in the ancient days,

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.000 align:middle line:84%
there used to be a guy
called Arjuna who was a king.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to know about
these kinds of questions.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Why is life-- he had to go into
a battle, and in that battle

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:84%
there were people on the other
side, the so-called enemy,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:84%
which included relatives
of his and so forth.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want to
kill all those guys.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so he had a driver
who drove him around

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in his cart, his chariot.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And one day he walked out
into the-- those of you

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that know the Hindu scriptures
and know the Bhagavad Gita

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:84%
are going to probably
really hate my story.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.652 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
butchering it right now.

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:53.735 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: I'm telling it my
way, but nevertheless, I

00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:55.460 align:middle line:84%
think my way is
kind of fun anyway.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Arjuna goes
walking out into the field,

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and there are all the
charioteer-- drivers

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.719 align:middle line:84%
are all sitting around their
fields having a marijuana

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.260 align:middle line:84%
cigarette or something,
whatever they

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.856 align:middle line:90%
were smoking in those days.

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what they were
smoking or drinking-- something.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And so-called here
comes Arjuna up

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to his driver who happens
to have the name Krishna.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:24.913 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.913 --> 00:43:25.704 align:middle line:90%
We've heard of him.

00:43:25.704 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Now that may
strike you as being

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
strange because Krishna is the
god of-- you know, the big god.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I've driven around
in cabs in New York many times,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and I've been
driven by Mohammad.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been driven
by Jesus, Moses.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:40.982 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:43:40.982 --> 00:43:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Krishna.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.262 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Krishna.

00:43:43.262 --> 00:43:44.085 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.085 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so
surprising that he

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.456 align:middle line:84%
would have a driver
named Krishna.

00:43:47.456 --> 00:43:50.212 align:middle line:84%
So he says to Krishna,
he says, OK, you know,

00:43:50.212 --> 00:43:52.003 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about this
battle and so forth.

00:43:52.003 --> 00:43:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Krisna says don't
worry about a thing.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:54.500 align:middle line:90%
I've got it all covered.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.583 align:middle line:90%
He says, what do you mean?

00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:58.170 align:middle line:84%
He says because I'm not just
Krishna, your ordinary driver,

00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.702 align:middle line:90%
I'm the big Krishna.

00:43:59.702 --> 00:44:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what do you
mean you're the big Krishna?

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.000 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'll show you.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly Krishna
reveals his true being.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And his true being is
like an infinity of suns.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, Arjuna,
looking at all of the beings,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:84%
all of the faces, all the
physiognomies of Krishna,

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.830 align:middle line:84%
suddenly sees in that list of
all those faces, his own face.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he realizes Arjuna is
Krishna, and Krishna is Arjuna.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But this has been all time.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Krishna is showing him all time.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact he's saying, I am
time itself, and you are me.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
revelation about the nature

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.685 align:middle line:90%
of time and space.

00:44:51.685 --> 00:44:54.037 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So I could be you.

00:44:54.037 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:84%
You could be me right
now in this quantum

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.610 align:middle line:90%
field of entanglement.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.525 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
quantum entanglement is really

00:44:59.525 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:84%
telling us is that we are
timeless in this very anciently

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.850 align:middle line:84%
vivid description that was
given in the Bhagavad Gita,

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure it's in
other cultures as well.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
simplify all that--

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
How does that have to do with
us today, right now in our life?

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: In order to do that,
in order to understand that, we

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:28.820 align:middle line:84%
need to think about something we
call our own personal timeline,

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.880 align:middle line:84%
a line that we imagine
is our line of time.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And for example, in the-- at
one end of the line of time,

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.670 align:middle line:84%
we may have us being born that
I would call the past now.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.449 align:middle line:84%
It's a now because when we were
born it was-- that was now.

00:45:45.449 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there's
part of that in us now.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's in the--
we bear a past now.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.697 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our present
now which may be, OK.

00:45:52.697 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is right now.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And we can even imagine a
future now in which we're older.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are three possible
points along our timeline:

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
past, present, future, and
I've just drawn them as dots

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
along our time line.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we draw a line through
that line of the time line,

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.730 align:middle line:84%
perpendicular to it, that would
represent space, all of space,

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and we just imagine it to be
like a huge plane of space.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.470 align:middle line:90%
But never mind.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just what we call
space, and what that really

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is is what we think
in mind is now.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So now is everything which is
perpendicular to our timeline.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we mean what
time is it now, we mean,

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:84%
over there, over there,
over there, over there,

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:90%
over there now.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can even
imagine something

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:55.010 align:middle line:84%
called light, which is we call
photons, particles of light,

00:46:55.010 --> 00:47:01.690 align:middle line:84%
which travel from here
now to there then.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And we could draw that is a
line of 45 degrees bisecting

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:15.260 align:middle line:84%
our space and time lines so that
this is time and that's space.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
This line of 45 degrees would
be going as a perpendicular

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:84%
bisector, which you
can see on the picture.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so that's
time as we know it.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So basically time is
basically up to the observer.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key insight
of Einstein in relativity,

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.746 align:middle line:84%
time is according
to the observer.

00:47:34.746 --> 00:47:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
time and the observer

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.022 align:middle line:84%
are intimately
connected together.

00:47:41.022 --> 00:47:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The same.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: And that is a big hint.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So now let's carry
picture a little further.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.350 align:middle line:84%
If we have something which
is moving on our picture,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:84%
here we have our timeline
and our light line,

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.920 align:middle line:84%
which is light going
off at 45 degrees,

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
moving at the speed of
light going through,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:84%
we have another line we
can draw which is not

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.250 align:middle line:84%
moving at 45 degrees, but
it's a little bit less

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.990 align:middle line:84%
than 45 degrees, and that might
be an object moving past us.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting at home,
and a car goes by, whoop.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Then in a space-time
diagram, that

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:84%
would look like a line going
up at less than 45 degrees.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's almost
parallel to the timeline

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's sloped a
little bit, and that we

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:90%
would call something moving.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the idea of-- I
just am bringing this back

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who might be a
little bit confused right now,

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but you did a great CD
series with Sounds True.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It was called "Do It
Yourself Time Travel."

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I loved that
because it really

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is that we as the observer
right now can create and act

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.500 align:middle line:84%
as if something is happening
that has not happened yet

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.870 align:middle line:84%
because our observation
of that thing happening,

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.960 align:middle line:84%
say we have a goal
in the future.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We can literally create
that as if it is happening

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:84%
right now in our mind's eye,
and as us as the observer,

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.530 align:middle line:84%
right now, we can create
that thing as happening.

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, we can
think of it as happening.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:11.650 align:middle line:84%
We can also think
of it as happened.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So both the past, the
present, and the future

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.890 align:middle line:90%
are aware from us.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole idea that
there is such a thing as now

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is really kind of
mysterious because there

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:24.205 align:middle line:90%
is no absolute now.

00:49:24.205 --> 00:49:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:29.600 align:middle line:84%
All there is is just a spread of
possibilities that we call now.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this idea
of a thought that

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.697 align:middle line:84%
comes through our timeline,
the speed of light

00:49:35.697 --> 00:49:37.655 align:middle line:84%
that thought comes through
our timeline, right?

00:49:37.655 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Well, maybe even faster.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.727 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even faster.

00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:42.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
thought in a moment,

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but we need to kind of
like go back to the ABCs

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.510 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
what is going on.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.636 align:middle line:84%
We have to find out about
matter and time and space

00:49:50.636 --> 00:49:52.218 align:middle line:84%
and then we can get
into these things.

00:49:52.218 --> 00:49:54.070 align:middle line:84%
You're almost going
into the advanced course

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:54.945 align:middle line:90%
with these questions.

00:49:54.945 --> 00:49:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: It's OK.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.808 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
wanted to make sure

00:49:57.808 --> 00:50:00.402 align:middle line:84%
that it applies to us and
our goals, or reality,

00:50:00.402 --> 00:50:02.110 align:middle line:84%
or if we want to run
a marathon, or if we

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:84%
want to achieve a certain
level of fitness or health.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: OK.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, all that's important,
but right now we're

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.267 align:middle line:90%
just looking at things moving.

00:50:09.267 --> 00:50:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The simplest things
we can think about

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.308 align:middle line:84%
is, how does
something go from here

00:50:12.308 --> 00:50:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to there, and from that we
can begin to figure out, well,

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.480 align:middle line:84%
why is it moving, and what's
making it move and so forth.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a picture,
and what relatively tells us

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:84%
about time-- and this
is what's very strange;

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that's why time
is very personal--

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.490 align:middle line:84%
is that time for
a moving observer

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is different than time for
a person who's not moving.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It slows down, but
what do I mean by that?

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It means that relative
to me, it's slowing down.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:45.080 align:middle line:84%
For the guy who is moving,
watching his own clock,

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.380 align:middle line:84%
everything seems
perfectly normal.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.470 align:middle line:84%
However, when he looks
at me who's not moving,

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't see me not moving.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:52.945 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.945 --> 00:50:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been in a car
where two cars are like this,

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and one car starts
to inch forward,

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
whether it's you moving

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.969 align:middle line:90%
or the other guy is backing up?

00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the meantime,
you're going 75 miles an hour.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.300 align:middle line:90%
So you're both moving.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Or whatever.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And you get relative,
so you can't

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.510 align:middle line:90%
see who is actually moving.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell who's
absolutely moving,

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.560 align:middle line:84%
so what you get then is
that each person sees

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:84%
the other timeline
as being different.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.240 align:middle line:84%
We won't get into the
details of all that,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:84%
but this is a kind of a picture
of what that might look like.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But what's important here is
we just move through this,

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.740 align:middle line:84%
is that it's possible to think
about something going faster

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.160 align:middle line:84%
than light speed, and
when we do that, we

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.270 align:middle line:84%
leave the realm of
ordinary matter.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
big hints that we've

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:39.520 align:middle line:84%
learned from quantum
physics and a thing

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.410 align:middle line:84%
called quantum field
theory is that matter

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:46.330 align:middle line:84%
has to play the game
of causality, which

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:50.850 align:middle line:84%
means that cause and effect have
to be related in such a way.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the only way they can
be related in such a way

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.670 align:middle line:84%
as we call causality, that
something happens first

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and then something
happens as a result

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.280 align:middle line:84%
of what happened first--
beginning and end.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
In order for that
to happen, you must

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.110 align:middle line:84%
have a way in which
whatever happened

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:17.140 align:middle line:84%
first can send
information to what

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:23.760 align:middle line:84%
happens next slower than light
speed or at light speed itself.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I shine at light
at you and you see the light,

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it takes time for the light to
leave wherever I am and reach

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.974 align:middle line:84%
your eye, it takes a very-- for
the distance we are right now,

00:52:35.974 --> 00:52:36.640 align:middle line:90%
it's very short.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fraction of time.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.005 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.005 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Light travels
at about a foot

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.130 align:middle line:90%
every billionth of a second.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And to give you some
idea of what a billion seconds

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:90%
is like, it seems like well--

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Billionth of a second.

00:52:52.112 --> 00:52:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: A billionth of a
second is a very small part.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very.

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But to give an idea of
what a billionth is compared

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to a billion, for example,
one billion seconds

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.990 align:middle line:90%
is about 32 years.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One billion
seconds is 32 years.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.920 align:middle line:90%
So a billionth of a second--

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.865 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: is a very small
part of the second.

00:53:08.865 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Very, very
small part of a second.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so light
travels very fast.

00:53:13.085 --> 00:53:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: One foot in that.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're really talking
about this realm-- see

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing is the
matrix of the mind of God

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:84%
is not a realm that we can
immediately get access to.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.779 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going very
fast, really very fast,

00:53:29.779 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and now we're talking about
something even going faster

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:84%
than the fastest we can
imagine, which is light,

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
which is something we call a
tachyon or something really

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.720 align:middle line:84%
speeding along, which
is faster than light.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we have,
then, the concept

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of what we call
the wall of light.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a wall of
light because everything

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that is within
this wall of light

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:58.240 align:middle line:84%
are events that are
happening in time

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but are only relatable by
one thing after another

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.090 align:middle line:84%
according to something
we call causality.

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So we say that's within
the wall of light.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:84%
We draw a picture of
it called a light cone,

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and we have two kinds of
cones we can think of,

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.130 align:middle line:84%
a past light cone and
a future light cone.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:20.320 align:middle line:84%
This may be a lot more detail
than you want to think about,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that,
but just bear with me

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:84%
a little bit because it's going
to get interesting in a moment.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Just idea that we have
this wall of light

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that everything within
the wall of light,

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.870 align:middle line:84%
everything within
the light cone,

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:36.430 align:middle line:84%
are things that you can
affect, and everything that's

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:37.890 align:middle line:84%
in the past light
cone are things

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that can have affected you,
but everything outside of it

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.370 align:middle line:90%
is called the elsewhere.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.887 align:middle line:84%
And the elsewhere is the
realm of the mind of God,

00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to get
into that in a moment.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
light is actually

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.670 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation of matter.

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.405 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.405 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Light is a
very important thing

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.490 align:middle line:90%
because it's on the borderline.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The wall of light is
actually the appearance

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.670 align:middle line:90%
of light in the universe.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It forms a wall in the sense
that everything going slower

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:11.650 align:middle line:84%
than it is within the wall
or within the light cone,

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.670 align:middle line:84%
everything faster than it is
in the elsewhere outside of it.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
kind of separation

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:20.060 align:middle line:84%
between what's faster than light
and what's slower than light.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
when you were a child

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that you are very
interested in light.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because light is really where
this whole thing gets started

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:34.140 align:middle line:84%
because in the beginning, God
created the heavens and Earth.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very
famous part we're

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.630 align:middle line:84%
going to come to in a
short moment about what

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:42.510 align:middle line:84%
the second paragraph of
the Hebrew Bible says,

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
something about and God
said, let there be light

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and there was light.

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:52.276 align:middle line:84%
When we look at that
saying in the Hebrew text,

00:55:52.276 --> 00:55:54.280 align:middle line:84%
vayomer Elohim
yehi-or vayehi-or--

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:59.012 align:middle line:90%


00:55:59.012 --> 00:56:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find out what
that means in a moment.

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It's Hebrew.

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.350 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
what that's saying,

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.100 align:middle line:84%
it's saying that not
only is there a light,

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.762 align:middle line:84%
but there must be
two kinds of light.

00:56:08.762 --> 00:56:09.595 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:56:09.595 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And we're
going to find out

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.306 align:middle line:84%
what are those two
kinds of light.

00:56:12.306 --> 00:56:15.447 align:middle line:84%
Why would God mention light
twice in the Hebrew writings?

00:56:15.447 --> 00:56:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Why is there two kinds of light?

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let there be light.

00:56:17.905 --> 00:56:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Let there be
light, and there was light.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:22.862 align:middle line:84%
It's not just let
there be light.

00:56:22.862 --> 00:56:24.570 align:middle line:84%
That should be enough
if it's only light,

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:26.210 align:middle line:90%
but there was light.

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is there's
got to be two kinds of light,

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:84%
the light that let there
be and the light that was.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.557 align:middle line:84%
So we want to find out what that
is, these two kinds of light,

00:56:35.557 --> 00:56:38.015 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we need to speak
about light in a little bit

00:56:38.015 --> 00:56:38.047 align:middle line:90%
more detail.

00:56:38.047 --> 00:56:39.838 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We need to
understand what light is

00:56:39.838 --> 00:56:40.886 align:middle line:90%
and how we relate to it.

00:56:40.886 --> 00:56:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So now, what we're
looking at now is,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.730 align:middle line:84%
first of all, how does
matter come into existence?

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:84%
In this picture,
what we're looking at

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is the quantum field
which is spontaneously--

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.830 align:middle line:84%
this is the mind of God working,
if you will-- spontaneously

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:58.160 align:middle line:90%
generating particles of matter.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And as it does so, they
come into existence,

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and they go out of existence,
and they come into existence,

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:06.175 align:middle line:84%
and they go out of
existence like bubbles.

00:57:06.175 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're showing those
bubbles from before.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is a
great illustration

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
because it really shows what
matter looks like all around us

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see
with the human eye.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: This is on a scale
that's so refined, so

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:22.477 align:middle line:84%
small that we'd have
to magnify this, oh, I

00:57:22.477 --> 00:57:24.060 align:middle line:84%
don't know how many
billions of times.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This is within the size
of a single nucleus,

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and if we try to
imagine how small it

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is, if we were to
blow up an atom

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:39.920 align:middle line:84%
so it was as big as
the planet Earth,

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
my thumb would be
to the planet Earth

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.606 align:middle line:90%
as an atom is to my thumb.

00:57:49.606 --> 00:57:51.652 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Keep going.

00:57:51.652 --> 00:57:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The nucleus, if we
were to blow up the atom

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.020 align:middle line:84%
so that it was as
big as say a football

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:03.040 align:middle line:84%
stadium, my thumb
on the 50-yard line

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
as compared the whole
stadium, my thumb would

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.960 align:middle line:84%
be as big as a nucleus
if the atom was

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.690 align:middle line:84%
as big as the whole
football stadium.

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.247 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about something
that's really very tiny,

00:58:13.247 --> 00:58:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and these things that we're
seeing in this picture

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:18.040 align:middle line:84%
are things happening on
that very tiny scale.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.278 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: --within the nucleus.

00:58:20.278 --> 00:58:20.778 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.778 --> 00:58:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is where matter
is actually forming

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:26.845 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking what's
called the quark field dance.

00:58:26.845 --> 00:58:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you were
to have a special camera

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with special technology that was
able to-- which they do exist--

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.190 align:middle line:84%
able to see these--
see matter, that's

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:36.465 align:middle line:90%
what the quantum field is.

00:58:36.465 --> 00:58:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The problem
is that light

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is made of photons,
particles of light,

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and they have frequencies,
and these frequencies

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.157 align:middle line:84%
are so high that no
light frequency would

00:58:47.157 --> 00:58:47.990 align:middle line:90%
be able to see this.

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:49.156 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Be captured by this.

00:58:49.156 --> 00:58:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Is this also where the
universal consciousness is?

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Is this where the collective
consciousness lies

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is in this quantum
field of matter?

00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: At this scale, it exists
on broader scales as well,

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly-- this is
the scale in which we're

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:07.816 align:middle line:84%
seeing, if you want, the
hologram of the universe coming

00:59:07.816 --> 00:59:08.440 align:middle line:90%
into existence.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.775 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
holographic universe.

00:59:10.775 --> 00:59:12.483 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, we're
going to get to that,

00:59:12.483 --> 00:59:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's
in another show.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.577 align:middle line:90%


00:59:16.577 --> 00:59:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stay tuned for that one.

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:18.701 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Stay tuned.

00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into this
God's mind, this matrix

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of hidden field where God
said, let there be light,

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and there was light.

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.763 align:middle line:84%
As I say, in Hebrew it's vayomer
Elohim yehi-or vayehi-or.

00:59:27.763 --> 00:59:31.090 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And those funny-looking letters
that you see on the screen

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.880 align:middle line:84%
right there are really
the same letters

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that I just mentioned but
written out in Hebrew.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, when you get into
a study of the sacred meaning

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of things, we have something
we call Kabbalah, or Kabbalah,

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In different ways.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: And it means to receive.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Kabbalah is
something you receive.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.940 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a restaurant
in Tel Aviv, for example,

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and you have a meal
and you want a receipt,

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.840 align:middle line:84%
you say to the waiter
Kabala Bevakasha, which

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.090 align:middle line:84%
means I want-- give me
the receipt, please.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.760 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.954 align:middle line:90%
It can be used another way.

01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah can mean a receipt,
or it means to receive.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.286 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or a major religion.

01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Or a major religion.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a study of the
meaning of the Hebrew letters

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.480 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and each
letter has a meaning.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this phrase,
"God said, let there be light

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and there was light," it
has a very special meaning.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Vayomer

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Elohim Yehi-or Vayehi-or.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%


01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it means.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.970 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Vayomer is the
saying, and God said,

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
is saying spirit is
coming into existence.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.525 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is entering
into existence.

01:00:48.525 --> 01:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what Vayomer means.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Elohim, and Elohim
is the Hebrew word for God.

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
plural of gods,

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
which is not often mentioned
in the sacred writings,

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.240 align:middle line:90%
but it really means gods.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.420 align:middle line:90%


01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It means spirit is moving
life and moving life

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.280 align:middle line:84%
at the same time it's
doing something else,

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and this is very important.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Elohim means not
only moving life,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.611 align:middle line:84%
but it also means bringing in
a resistance to that movement.

01:01:23.611 --> 01:01:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that create?

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.494 align:middle line:90%
A resistance.

01:01:25.494 --> 01:01:26.035 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Mind.

01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mind.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.317 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: A mind which
resists the movement.

01:01:30.317 --> 01:01:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.233 align:middle line:90%
So that's where the observer is.

01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That's where the
observer is coming into.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Yehi, which
means let there be.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.020 align:middle line:90%


01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Yehi means that life
comes into existence,

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and that gives more existence.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.646 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.646 --> 01:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have this spirit,
the existence of spirit,

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and then it gets into light, and
then it needs mind, which is--

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Elohim is the resistance
of the spirit giving rise

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to the movement of
existence, and then we

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
have Yehi, which is existence
giving rise to something which

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
is a life, giving rise
to existence again.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
intertwining chain.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.711 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the next word,
and this is the magical word,

01:02:20.711 --> 01:02:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Or.

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.270 align:middle line:90%


01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Aleph-Vav-Reish-- Or is
the Hebrew word for light.

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And Aleph means the spirit.

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Vav means the fertilizing agent,
or that which distributes,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and Reish, the third letter
is the whole universe.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So Aleph-Vav-Reish means spirit
fertilizing the whole universe.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So light means spirit
fertilizing the whole universe.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And light is at the
center of everything.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:47.005 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Everything.

01:02:47.005 --> 01:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything, yes.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:48.621 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Everything.

01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in many
sacred writings you

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
find that God is light, that
it's often said that way.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:54.350 align:middle line:90%
I am the light.

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So now we
have Yehi-or, then

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.975 align:middle line:84%
we have another
Vayehi, and again.

01:03:00.975 --> 01:03:02.540 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Yayehi-or.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Two word-- the word Or
is pronounced twice,

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
let there be light,
and let there be light.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is light.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Let there be light
and let there be light,

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%
two Ors, Aleph-Vav-Reish twice.

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Why twice?

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why twice?

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.303 align:middle line:84%
Why two different
references to light?

01:03:20.303 --> 01:03:23.296 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And it turns out this is
very necessary for the universe

01:03:23.296 --> 01:03:23.795 align:middle line:90%
to begin.

01:03:23.795 --> 01:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%


01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
There are two kinds of light.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We have light that
zigzags in space,

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
which produces what we
call the particles, matter,

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
that we existence in.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And this zigzagging
light that appears,

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.650 align:middle line:84%
when it appears as
matter, turns out

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to make up all of the material
particles of the universe,

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
which is basically what we call
the electrons and positrons.

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So light slowed
down is this table.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.860 align:middle line:90%
So matter is light slowed down.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It slows down
by doing a zigzag dance.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
If I-- Let's say I'm
trying to go that way.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
If I just go that
way, no problem.

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But suppose I want to go
that way by zigzagging?

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's going to
take you a lot longer.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's going to
take me a lot longer.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's more dense.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.358 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So in a sense,
it's going slower.

01:04:15.358 --> 01:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So if I zigzag
like this, it takes

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
me longer than just
going straight.

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So light just goes straight,
but when light does this dance,

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
it's slowing down, and
that's what matter is.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this table
is a combination

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
of light zigzagging
back and forth,

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
slowing down enough
to form solid matter.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And it's also
doing something else.

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.135 align:middle line:90%
It's spinning.

01:04:37.135 --> 01:04:37.635 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:04:37.635 --> 01:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Now we're getting--
that's a very important part

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.270 align:middle line:90%
of it.

01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:42.186 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's kind of
like I'm doing right now.

01:04:42.186 --> 01:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It spins in
a very special way,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.469 align:middle line:84%
and it's this two kinds of
light that we're talking about.

01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We're only speaking about
one kind of light right

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
now, the kind that
spins in a special way.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.976 align:middle line:84%
We call it spin-1/2, and we even
have a language that physicists

01:04:54.976 --> 01:04:55.475 align:middle line:90%
call them.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:56.927 align:middle line:90%
They call them spinners.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I thought it was
going to be a fancy word.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:04:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Spinners.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.124 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No, spinners.

01:05:00.124 --> 01:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a spinner-- it's a
spin-1/2 kind of light.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And spin-1/2 kind of light
is the only light that turns

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.020 align:middle line:90%
into matter.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.080 align:middle line:90%


01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And it's a
funny kind of light.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's spin-1/2, it has to
kind of dance in a kind of way

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
that's very familiar to the
Sufi-ists who do this kind

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.147 align:middle line:84%
of dance, which I'm going
to show you in a moment.

01:05:24.147 --> 01:05:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
light slowed down.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is brainastics
that we're doing here.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.255 align:middle line:84%
This is the art of
what matter really is.

01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.921 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I definitely
want to bring this

01:05:34.921 --> 01:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
back to how this applies
to us in the universe.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: So if we look
at this, for example,

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
in the wall light picture,
this, for example,

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
shows an observer
observing something

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
moving slower than
light, very normal thing.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's also-- then
we look at how information

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.130 align:middle line:90%
is being told to the observer.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Sequentially, from the
beginning to the end,

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
he's saying oh, it's
there, now it's here.

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Now it's there.

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
He's building up a causal
picture of the universe.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I saw it there, now it's here,
now it's there, now it's there,

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's all causal
because everything's

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
contained within
the light cones.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what that picture means.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
But now we have something else.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Here we have something
moving faster than light,

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and it sends information to
the observer by ordinary light,

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but we see the messages
coming in in a scrambled way.

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
We're not just getting
the past coming before

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and the future
events coming after.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They're coming in in this
rather scrambled way.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
What is the meaning of all that?

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we're seeing
is a thought arising

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of the
observer, and what

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
he's doing is he's
creating events which

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.186 align:middle line:84%
are the sentence-- the parts of
the sentence he wants to make,

01:06:50.186 --> 01:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but in order to
make sense of it,

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
he's got to go back into the
past to bring in past events

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to bring it into logical order.

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
does all this mean?

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:02.145 align:middle line:90%
How does this relate to us?

01:07:02.145 --> 01:07:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: This is how we think.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is how we think.

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: This is how we think.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
This is how thoughts arise.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
about, how is it

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that I know what I'm
going to say next,

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
when right now I have no idea
what I'm going to say next?

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just explained
in a quantum physics what's

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
happening when words come out
of our mouth and thoughts form.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:17.294 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:07:17.294 --> 01:07:18.044 align:middle line:90%
Between the words.

01:07:18.044 --> 01:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This shows me
the power of thought.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.249 align:middle line:84%
This shows me how we can
manifest thought into reality.

01:07:23.249 --> 01:07:23.915 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This shows me
the importance of where

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts can either
intoxicate our bodies

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and our lives or our
thoughts can move us forward

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:32.575 align:middle line:84%
into a space of
love or creation.

01:07:32.575 --> 01:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've got
some idea about how

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
the mind is working at it.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's look a little bit more
into the dance of matter,

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
remarkable dance.

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:48.719 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it's
all done with mirrors.

01:07:48.719 --> 01:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you, as a child,
I stood in front of a mirror

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.230 align:middle line:90%
in order to learn.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:54.455 align:middle line:84%
So in a way I kind of feel
close to this process.

01:07:54.455 --> 01:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're the performer
and the observer, yes.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yeah.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.520 align:middle line:90%
The performer and the observer.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We think of the Sufi dances,
the whirling dervishes,

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is a picture
showing that kind of idea

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
in very abstract form,
and there are really

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
four different ways in which we
can think of these dervishes.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at these.

01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Here we have on
the bottom-- we see

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
a dervish which is
spinning to the right.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll call that a
right-handed spinner.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.960 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.899 align:middle line:84%
And now, over to
the left over there,

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.759 align:middle line:84%
we have another kind
of-- but wait a minute,

01:08:28.759 --> 01:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that dervish is
standing on his head.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.200 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Turn it on its head,
and we have a dervish

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
which is spinning in
the opposite direction.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.569 align:middle line:90%


01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:41.859 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is
spinning to the right,

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
this would be
spinning to the left.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.655 align:middle line:84%
Looking downward, this
would be going clockwise.

01:08:45.655 --> 01:08:47.696 align:middle line:84%
Looking downward, this is
going counterclockwise.

01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:48.815 align:middle line:90%


01:08:48.815 --> 01:08:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why did we
turn it upside down?

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.798 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Just to give you
the two possibilities.

01:08:52.798 --> 01:08:53.298 align:middle line:90%


01:08:53.298 --> 01:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So this would be a spinner
with one direction of spin,

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
a spinner with another
direction of spin

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:00.810 align:middle line:90%
all with the right hand.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.569 align:middle line:90%


01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:06.226 align:middle line:84%
But we also have something we
can call a left-handed spinner.

01:09:06.226 --> 01:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So here is a
left-handed spinner.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.779 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Notice it's a mirror image.

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The top picture is
kind of like a mirror

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
image of the bottom picture
because it's spinning this way.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Looking down, it would
be spinning clockwise.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.479 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
its mirror image.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:26.279 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's turned around, and
it will be looking like this.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:30.319 align:middle line:84%
So there are four possibilities
that these spinners can appear

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to us: this way, this way,
this way, and that way--

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
four different arrangements
in which matter

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.070 align:middle line:90%
can come into existence.

01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%


01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we're
looking at, how this happens.

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:46.229 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is all
about how we create thoughts

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.974 align:middle line:90%
into reality.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: This is basically how
matter from the mind of God

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.529 align:middle line:90%
is coming into reality.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:54.389 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
could be your mind.

01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You're using the mind of God
and your mind is the same thing.

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Well, yes.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to understand that
it's all done through mirrors,

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
mirrors that we use.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
In physics we deal with
what are called symmetries,

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most famous ones
is called the PCT symmetry,

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
which means basically
parity, which

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
means space reversal,
charge, which means actually

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
charge reversal, which is matter
and anti-matter-- same thing--

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.910 align:middle line:90%
and time or time reversal.

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:26.277 align:middle line:84%
And I've made a little picture
using barber poles, which

01:10:26.277 --> 01:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is the same thing
as your hands, which

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.550 align:middle line:90%
shows you what that looks like.

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Here we see, for
example, something

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.655 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look
at something called

01:10:32.655 --> 01:10:35.770 align:middle line:90%
parity, or space reversal.

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Here we see a particle
has not yet appeared yet,

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
but this is like in the
mind of God so to speak,

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to reflect.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Here we see it's a
right-handed particle.

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.202 align:middle line:90%
We see a barber pole.

01:10:49.202 --> 01:10:50.785 align:middle line:84%
And notice how the
stripes are moving.

01:10:50.785 --> 01:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%


01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The stripes are moving in
the direction of the thumb

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that you see on the
picture right there.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Remind me again how this
relates to us right now.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:58.936 align:middle line:84%
Remind me again what
the bigger picture is.

01:10:58.936 --> 01:11:00.477 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: This what--
this is a picture

01:11:00.477 --> 01:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
of a particle coming
into existence.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Particle coming into existence.

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And now we're going
to reflect it in a mirror.

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:09.554 align:middle line:84%
I've just drawn another
arrow to show you

01:11:09.554 --> 01:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that it's a
right-handed particle.

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thought
coming into existence.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are particles.

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.155 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's a
particle, not a thought,

01:11:14.155 --> 01:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and this shows you the direction
of the spin and the direction

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
in which the stripes, the
barber pole, are moving.

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
barber pole is a picture

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
of what matter, the electron
for example, looks like.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now when it gets
reflected in this mirror,

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:30.870 align:middle line:90%
it turns upside down.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the two
stripes are moving.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.030 align:middle line:90%


01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The stripes are
move-- This is moving

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite direction.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But also notice-- so I can
do it like this with my hand

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
like so-- also notice
that not only is it

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
spinning in the
opposite direction,

01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:50.125 align:middle line:84%
but its stripes are pointed
in the opposite direction.

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:51.300 align:middle line:90%


01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
This one on the
left has its stripes

01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
going from the top right to
the bottom left going downward.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas on the right, from
the top-left to the top-right

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
it's going in the
opposite direction.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that we have the
spins are going in the same--

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
we're all spinning the same way,
but the stripes are different.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The stripes are not
in the same way.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
From left to right on
the left they go up,

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and from left to right on
the right they go down.

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:24.680 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are two different
barber poles here,

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.475 align:middle line:90%
two different designs.

01:12:28.475 --> 01:12:30.552 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Spinning two
different directions.

01:12:30.552 --> 01:12:32.635 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Spinning, actually,
in the same direction.

01:12:32.635 --> 01:12:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Same direction.

01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But because they're
different orientations--

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
see they're both
spinning this way.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:41.499 align:middle line:84%
The spin is in the direction
in which your fingers curl,

01:12:41.499 --> 01:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
but your thumb is
pointing in the direction

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:44.623 align:middle line:90%
in which the stripes are moving.

01:12:44.623 --> 01:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And the stripes are going
in opposite directions.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
This parity reversal
is extremely important.

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
This space reversal is
extremely important.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Without this, there
can be no matter.

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Now why?

01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: We're going to see.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Here's something we
call a time symmetry.

01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a
left-handed particle,

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
which is curling like this
and the thumb going down.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
If we reflect it in time, which
means we send time backwards,

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it also turns into a
left-handed particle,

01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
but things get reversed.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the stripes
are pointing the same way,

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
but the spins are reversed.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: But the-- it's
still left handed.

01:13:33.644 --> 01:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
On the right side of the picture
is the left hand pointing down,

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:38.510 align:middle line:84%
left hand pointing up,
and time reversal--

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.600 align:middle line:90%
this is what happens.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Time reversal is what?

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:43.200 align:middle line:90%


01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That's
difficult to explain.

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.642 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This isn't?

01:13:46.642 --> 01:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: This isn't.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Time reversal is
almost like watching

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.080 align:middle line:90%
a movie going backwards in time.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
particles do that, too,

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.097 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of the
way the game is played.

01:13:58.097 --> 01:13:59.513 align:middle line:84%
We'll come to that
a little later.

01:13:59.513 --> 01:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't want to
get any more confused.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:00.935 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:00.935 --> 01:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And here's
another one which

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
we call-- here's time symmetry
with a right-handed particle.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I just put that in.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll just go through
that very fast.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:09.670 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And now here's something we call
C symmetry or charge reversal.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It has the same thing to do
with matter and anti-matter

01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.910 align:middle line:90%
coming into existence.

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a
right-handed particle,

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and when we look to see
on the left-handed side,

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a
left-handed particle.

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, the
directions of the barber poles

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
are the same, but the
spins are reversed

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
and the hands are reversed.

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
matter to antimatter,

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
things get twisted
around, and we'll

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
come to that a little
later on, but first

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
let me just move now into a
picture of why this parity

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.120 align:middle line:90%
reversal is very important.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Here is a particle of
matter coming into existence

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:58.165 align:middle line:84%
and moving at the speed of
light and then going out

01:14:58.165 --> 01:14:58.706 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

01:14:58.706 --> 01:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly something
called the mind of God

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:10.210 align:middle line:84%
acts and produces a
right-handed particle, which

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
now goes in the
opposite direction,

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
goes out of existence, produces
another left-handed particle,

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and we have this famous zigzag.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And now
the zigzag is what

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
we call an actual
particle of matter.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.860 align:middle line:90%


01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
This is what it's made
out of, zigzagging

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.042 align:middle line:90%
particles going very fast.

01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These
chairs, these tables.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: All the
electrons and the quarks,

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
they're all doing this
dance, and they're

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
interacting with this field
called the Higgs field or Mind

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.320 align:middle line:84%
of God field, or whatever
you want to call it,

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.265 align:middle line:84%
that's interacting and causing
the zigzag to take place.

01:15:46.265 --> 01:15:48.470 align:middle line:90%


01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
look at a thought.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Here we have something going--

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:52.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yay.

01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at thoughts now.

01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:54.284 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: We're
looking at thought.

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Here we're looking at something
going backward in time,

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
then turning around,
going forward in time,

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
then turning around and
going backward in time.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here
is when something

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
can go backwards and
forwards in time,

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
it could literally stay in
space and not go anywhere,

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
but time has gotten
frozen for it

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
nowhere in time.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
In a certain sense, it's
moving through space but not

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.160 align:middle line:90%
through time.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's moving faster than
the speed of light.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We would call that tachyonic or
the action of the mind of God.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking at,
is it all an illusion?

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:34.725 align:middle line:90%
How does it all work?

01:16:34.725 --> 01:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what a
memory-- actually when you

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
said they get frozen
in time, that's

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
what a past memory frozen
in time would look like?

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It's frozen in
time in a certain sense,

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
but you see it's moving
through space but not in time,

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:55.355 align:middle line:84%
and that's, in a way,
how memory works.

01:16:55.355 --> 01:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%


01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
From any point of view,
something going faster

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
than light could be looked
at as being everywhere

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
at once, frozen in time.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so how
that applies to us,

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, bring this
all together for us.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.390 align:middle line:90%
How does this apply to our--

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, what
we're saying here

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
gets created

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
in which light going
forward in time

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
through spatial reflections
produces the material

01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:31.695 align:middle line:90%
world of matter.

01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:32.980 align:middle line:90%


01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:37.826 align:middle line:84%
Through time reflections,
it produces a mental world

01:17:37.826 --> 01:17:38.325 align:middle line:90%
of mind.

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:39.456 align:middle line:90%


01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in the very
beginning of the show

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
when I talked about how we're
going to look at time, space,

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and matter differently,
this is breaking it down

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to the quantum physics level of
where light and time and space

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:58.815 align:middle line:84%
and matter are all very,
very, very different.

01:17:58.815 --> 01:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: They're different
but they're essentially

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at how the mind
of God is working by producing

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
these rather strange
spinning-1/2 particles,

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.610 align:middle line:90%
which produce the matter field.

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
second kind of light

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.380 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't
talked about yet,

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's the light that
we see with our eyes,

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
the ordinary kind of light.

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We call that spin-1 light,
not spin-1/2 like the spinners

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
were.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.715 align:middle line:84%
The spin-1 light is the
thing we call ordinary light,

01:18:33.715 --> 01:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
like the nor-- and spin-1 light
is essentially messengers.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.800 align:middle line:90%
They're like the god Mercury.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
They carry stuff from
one place to another.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The spin 1/2 half
stuff is structuring,

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:46.350 align:middle line:90%
getting things in order.

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:48.250 align:middle line:90%


01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
The spin-1 stuff is sending
things through space and time,

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.477 align:middle line:84%
and that's what light does,
the ordinary light we see.

01:18:55.477 --> 01:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So really, basically,
what we're looking at here

01:18:57.810 --> 01:19:00.340 align:middle line:90%
is everything is an illusion.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an illusion.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
You've just explain this
through quantum physics,

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that light and time and space
and matter is all an illusion.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
This interview is an illusion
if you think about it.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So if everything is
truly an illusion--

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Everything
is, in a sense,

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
made of light, which has really
no actual matter or substance,

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and in that sense, it's a light
show that we're living through.

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it is up
to us as the observer

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to watch that show happen
in this show of life

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.265 align:middle line:90%
essentially happen.

01:19:33.265 --> 01:19:36.067 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: We can't help it because
we're made of the same stuff.

01:19:36.067 --> 01:19:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're the observer
and the performer

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.246 align:middle line:84%
and the observer
and the performer.

01:19:39.246 --> 01:19:40.121 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's right.

01:19:40.121 --> 01:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then how this
applies to our lives

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
right now is we're
thinking about our past is

01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that we are the observer and
the performer in our past.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
We can objectively observe our
past as if, so it happened,

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:53.580 align:middle line:90%
it's an illusion.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.445 align:middle line:84%
If we go forward into time
and we want to create a goal,

01:19:57.445 --> 01:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially
that same illusion.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So we can go forward
and to create

01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
into new ways of thinking, of
new sources of free energy,

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of new ways of
forming government,

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:12.567 align:middle line:84%
of new ways of
forming relationships.

01:20:12.567 --> 01:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You could bring it down
to the mundane level

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of new ways of
creating your health,

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:19.324 align:middle line:84%
and this is how this
all comes together.

01:20:19.324 --> 01:20:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Exactly.

01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So that was what-- I mean,
you beautifully explain this.

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Maybe not so
beautifully, but I tried.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to wrap your
mind around this stuff,

01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:33.939 align:middle line:84%
but you're hitting
the essential core.

01:20:33.939 --> 01:20:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.945 align:middle line:84%
But it helps to understand
because I couldn't explain it

01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:38.090 align:middle line:90%
in the way that you did.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It took you to explain how
space, time, and matter all

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
have-- are interrelated and
also have changed in order

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand how we look
at our past as the observer

01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and how we look at our
future as the observer.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Right.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we don't need
to get stuck anymore.

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that one has
to learn is to identify,

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and the identification
process is a matter of choice.

01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
To identify with yourself,
your bodily self,

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.856 align:middle line:90%
is one form of identification.

01:21:12.856 --> 01:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%


01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
To identify with yourself,
your past self as you were,

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
is another kind
of identification.

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
To identify with your
future self as you will be

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
is another kind
of identification.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.829 align:middle line:84%
Certain teachers
teach you, think

01:21:29.829 --> 01:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
about how you're going
to be in the future.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Think about already being
there and having it.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:35.735 align:middle line:90%
That's a fantasy.

01:21:35.735 --> 01:21:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Acting as if, yes.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Acting as if, you
know, and that's fine.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Thinking how you were in the
past, that's also a fantasy,

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.450 align:middle line:90%
but it's also fine.

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Fantasy by name, another
word for illusion, but it's

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
just as much of an
illusion to think

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.745 align:middle line:90%
about how you are right now.

01:21:54.745 --> 01:21:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So how do you apply the
field of quantum physics

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to the law of attraction that
we've heard so much about?

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The law
of attraction is--

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:08.995 align:middle line:84%
can be many different things
to many different people.

01:22:08.995 --> 01:22:10.780 align:middle line:90%


01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go along
with everything

01:22:14.150 --> 01:22:16.230 align:middle line:90%
in the law of attraction.

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:20.109 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't quite put my fingers
on it and say it's a law.

01:22:20.109 --> 01:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not a
law of physics the way

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.500 align:middle line:90%
it was being presented, no.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really more of
a metaphor for stuff.

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:29.850 align:middle line:90%


01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
To teach people that
all you gotta do

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
is wish for winning
the lotto and you're

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
going to win the lottery.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.324 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I do to
people, I say, OK.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.740 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
work, but you also

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
have to consider that everybody
wants the same thing you want.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So let everybody go out
and buy a separate lotto

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
ticket and everybody
wants to win the lotto.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.615 align:middle line:84%
And let's say that you
all buy the same lotto

01:22:55.615 --> 01:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
ticket, the same winning
numbers, and you all win.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.200 align:middle line:90%
How much money do you get?

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Actually you'll get, on a $5
ticket, you may get $0.03.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.355 align:middle line:84%
So you won the lotto, but
it wasn't worth it, was it?

01:23:08.355 --> 01:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But does the law
that like attracts like

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
apply to the law of
attraction at all?

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.916 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Not really.

01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:18.011 align:middle line:84%
It's really like attracts
unlike in the physical, material

01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
world.

01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:21.036 align:middle line:84%
That's what we talk-- remember
we were talking about charge

01:23:21.036 --> 01:23:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and matter and anti-matter.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.750 align:middle line:90%


01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Positrons and electrons
are matter and anti-matter,

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:29.112 align:middle line:84%
and they will attract each
other and annihilate each other.

01:23:29.112 --> 01:23:29.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:23:29.945 --> 01:23:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: So like attracts unlike.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%


01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole idea
of using the idea like

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
attracts like, it's a
kind of a mixed metaphor.

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:42.970 align:middle line:90%


01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
quite work that way.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.661 align:middle line:84%
So I never used that in the
film when I was in the movie.

01:23:48.661 --> 01:23:49.702 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "What the Bleep?"

01:23:49.702 --> 01:23:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:50.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.485 align:middle line:90%
In the movie "The Secret."

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you have an idea
of like attract like,

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.996 align:middle line:90%
like attracts unlike.

01:23:58.996 --> 01:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Unlike.

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
apply that to like?

01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, you have
to think about that.

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%


01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If you-- Here you
are a superstar.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.860 align:middle line:90%


01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Walk down the street, superstar.

01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:14.510 align:middle line:90%


01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:15.375 align:middle line:90%
See who you attract.

01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:17.990 align:middle line:90%


01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:19.677 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who wants
to be a superstar.

01:24:19.677 --> 01:24:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:20.880 align:middle line:90%
The unlike.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.546 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And they're
not like you at all.

01:24:22.546 --> 01:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:24.470 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you really
do want to attract

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.656 align:middle line:84%
the right type of
environment for yourself,

01:24:29.656 --> 01:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
what would you have to say?

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.725 align:middle line:90%
Be unlike that environment.

01:24:32.725 --> 01:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Don't think of it
as attracting, as seducing.

01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:37.060 align:middle line:90%


01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not an attraction.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You think
of it as being.

01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Think it as a giving.

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.020 align:middle line:90%


01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You give to get in
this kind of thing.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's sharing.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It's giving.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's providing a field in
which an invitation is offered

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
rather than a field in
which you say I want.

01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I want.

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:01.600 align:middle line:90%
I want.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.260 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of one thing,
"I," and suddenly it

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
becomes the wanting,
and the wanting

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is the field of wanting, and
everybody shares in that field.

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So now learn to
identify with that

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and then you can see
what is it that I

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
can give to that
field of wanting.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is what the
quantum field is all about.

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.546 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: That is what the
quantum field is all about.

01:25:23.546 --> 01:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in these experiments
where enough people intention

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
or meditate on one specific
outcome, that field,

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that quantum field of wanting
without attachment or an ego

01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:36.160 align:middle line:84%
in specific ways of
having it turn out,

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.660 align:middle line:90%
but that actually can work.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: It will work,
but the magical thing

01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:41.550 align:middle line:90%
is to give up the ego.

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the point
is you-- you can't

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.555 align:middle line:90%
be wanting it for yourself.

01:25:47.555 --> 01:25:49.200 align:middle line:90%


01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't quite-- the richest
people in the universe,

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
in the world, are
not people that

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%
have made money for themselves.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
There are exceptions.

01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say that,
but usually the exceptions

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.770 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
get thrown into jail.

01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.833 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Like the Ponzi schemers.

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.190 align:middle line:90%


01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
The people that are capable
of creating wealth for others

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.485 align:middle line:90%
get very wealthy themselves.

01:26:11.485 --> 01:26:12.384 align:middle line:90%


01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:13.675 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that interesting?

01:26:13.675 --> 01:26:17.135 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: The people that are--
I mean, take Oprah Winfrey,

01:26:17.135 --> 01:26:17.635 align:middle line:90%
for example.

01:26:17.635 --> 01:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's a
very remarkable woman

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
who has created an enormous
field for others to benefit

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
from her story, and
she's become one

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.450 align:middle line:84%
of the richest
people in the world.

01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:33.682 align:middle line:84%
And not because she
wants to make money.

01:26:33.682 --> 01:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I never got her as
a money grabber.

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.023 align:middle line:90%
That isn't her thing.

01:26:36.023 --> 01:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's rich in
spirit and rich in kindness.

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Because
she's spiritually

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
interested in
helping other people.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.425 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of her shows are
based upon helping others.

01:26:44.425 --> 01:26:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.655 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --and showing
how this can be achieved.

01:26:48.655 --> 01:26:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what this
show is about as well.

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: And so that's what
we all have to be doing.

01:26:55.790 --> 01:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to be remembering
that we're not--

01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:02.335 align:middle line:90%
the self is an illusion.

01:27:02.335 --> 01:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%


01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It's illusion.

01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It's based upon survival of
the material substance, which

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
are the body interacting
with-- the mind interacting

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:13.120 align:middle line:90%
with the body.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you identify with
that, then everything you do

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.046 align:middle line:84%
will be to ensure the survival
at the cost of others.

01:27:21.046 --> 01:27:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you think
that you're stressed,

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.262 align:middle line:84%
then that will become a reality
and it will form in other ways

01:27:26.262 --> 01:27:26.970 align:middle line:90%
around your life.

01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
If you think the outcome
is going to be negative,

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.674 align:middle line:84%
then that will form
around the rest of it.

01:27:30.674 --> 01:27:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So if it's all
really an illusion,

01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and if stress is an
illusion, and if negativity

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion, then we
can turn that around.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.135 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Negativity, stress
arise from one single word.

01:27:42.135 --> 01:27:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survival.

01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: No.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I.

01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: If you think about
every negative thought you have,

01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to bet
you dollars to donuts

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.915 align:middle line:84%
that there is an I
in there somewhere.

01:27:56.915 --> 01:27:58.230 align:middle line:90%


01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen?

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.635 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen to me?

01:28:00.635 --> 01:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%


01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Why am I this way?

01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I be like
her or like him?

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Why am I so dumb?

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I be smart like he is?

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's all---

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: I. I. I. I. I. I. I.

01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So getting
off of yourself

01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that we're
part of this quantum field.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we've also
learned today,

01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and I thank you so much
for these perspectives

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- in understanding
the quantum level of this,

01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:30.401 align:middle line:84%
it helps us understand
the macro level of it.

01:28:30.401 --> 01:28:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: Yes.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have
learned today a lot.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that it
is all an illusion.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that time itself
is based on the observer.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that we are the
creators of our own experiences

01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:46.585 align:middle line:84%
as long as it doesn't
involve the ego and the I.

01:28:46.585 --> 01:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: Well, it has to involve
the ego and I to some extent--

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.991 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To some degree.

01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLF: --because you're
here in a bodily form.

01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is don't
identify with the ego I.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Experience it, yes.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.510 align:middle line:90%
You're hungry, eat.

01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:03.510 align:middle line:90%
You're tired, sleep.

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:05.240 align:middle line:90%


01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You're in need of
love, reach out.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
you give it up all.

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't lose it all,
but give it its relevance,

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
but don't make it
the only thing that's

01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:20.150 align:middle line:84%
important to what
your life is about.

01:29:20.150 --> 01:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Because really,
your greatest joy

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.810 align:middle line:84%
will come from
compassion, understanding,

01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:29.240 align:middle line:90%
giving of yourself to others.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it works.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And you get reward from that.

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just the way
the quantum world works.

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
quantum universe works.

01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: That's the way it works.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
great way to wrap up.

01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLF: You're very welcome.

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've gone
full circle here,

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.344 align:middle line:90%
and I really appreciate it.

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Fred.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
I've learned today

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is that time is really
up to the observer

01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a
do-it-yourself approach to time

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
travel as Fred Alan
Wolf talked about.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But really, we are the creators
of our own experience--

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.620 align:middle line:84%
our past, our present,
and our future--

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and that this concept can really
apply to all areas of our life.

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This is Lisa Garr, and
thanks for watching Gaiam TV.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:13.483 align:middle line:90%
