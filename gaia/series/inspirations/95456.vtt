00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:84%
If you would like
a reason to smile,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
then you really will
enjoy my guest today.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Preston Smiles is my guest.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Love
will find a way.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything else will
find an excuse."

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly said.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
He's the co-founder
of the Love Mob, which

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
is a social movement
dedicated to spreading love

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:84%
all over world through
organized acts of love.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a giant flash
mob chanting about love,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.834 align:middle line:84%
then you're most likely
going to find Preston there.

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
be smiling along

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:84%
with hundreds and hundreds of
other people and love mobbers.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.354 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PRESTON SMILES: Thank you.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessed and
honored to be here.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm excited
to have you here.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Thank you for
bringing your smile as well,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.949 align:middle line:90%
because it's gigantic.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It comes through.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So the Love Mob-- my
god, what a great idea.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
How did you start that,
that flow of the Love Mob?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.055 align:middle line:84%
That's a loaded question,
because everything's--

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
everything is everything,
as we all know.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But I would say it came
through in a meditation.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It did?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Uh-huh.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:90%
And I don't claim it as mine.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I know that we all
are chosen for things

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
to be birthed from us.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And it came at a time
when the Sandy Hook School

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:90%
shooting happened.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.475 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that it was
time for people to stop talking

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and to get out on
the streets again.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I initially thought it would
just be like maybe 50 people.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up at one point,
and it was a couple minutes

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
before the first
one we were doing.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a sea of people.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You had a minute there.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And I was
like, oh, they're ready.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.395 align:middle line:90%
And, like, it's here.

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have been through
quite an amazing journey,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:90%
which is inspiring.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And it also
impresses upon people

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:90%
that everything is possible.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell us a little
bit about your childhood.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you grow up?

00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Here in LA?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Yeah, I'm an
LA kid, which is awesome,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.467 align:middle line:90%
because there's not many of us.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
don't live in LA,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the-- I guess the
Hollywood part of LA,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.327 align:middle line:84%
most people don't actually--
they're not actually from here.

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: But I grew up in LA.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in
somewhat of a Dennis

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
the Menace sort of suburb
called Harbor City,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
which is in the South
Bay of Los Angeles.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And I am just old
enough and just

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
young enough to be a part of
what people call Millennials,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
which-- from my understanding,
there's only one living

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.207 align:middle line:84%
generation and
it's happening now.

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.649 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: But for all intents
and purposes, I'm a Millennial.

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're up to something.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Exactly.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And during the
time I was growing

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
up was when there was a
shift in music and a shift

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
in how we report news.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I went from listening
to this conscious music,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
from X-Clan and Special
Ed, to NWA and Ice Cube

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and all of these different,
like, very gangster rap.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, my
nine-year-old consciousness

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
couldn't really grasp
what I was supposed

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to be, because everything in the
history books, everything that

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
was supposedly good,
including Santa

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Claus and this fake picture
of Jesus that they made,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.775 align:middle line:90%
was all white.

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:46.574 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't look like that.

00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So you started going
through, well, maybe I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
should identify with this.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should-- whatever's
presented in front of you--

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --was what you were
identifying with and going

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
towards, because
that was-- whatever

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.284 align:middle line:84%
felt like you were the
closest to it, right?

00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:00.991 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Mm-hmm.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So then was it the
music that kind of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:90%
sucked you into that world?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.995 align:middle line:90%
Or was it--

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Everything.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: It was everything.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
It was the news.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It was music.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It was everything that came
out during that period was--

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
it said that people who looked
like me were aggressive,

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
were mean, were beast, that
sold drugs and did things.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And take in mind, I was
living in a essentially upper

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
middle class neighborhood
that, by the time I was 15,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:90%
we turned into a war zone.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And there was no reason for it.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.929 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
You saw that transition happen.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.319 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are formative
years for you.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.445 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge time
of you needing

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to make a lot of
decisions and becoming

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
an adolescent and a man.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what was it that
changed the neighborhood?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.504 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: You know,
I wouldn't give it--

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.897 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say there was
one catalyst moment, per se.

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: But I will say that,
in hindsight, right around 11,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
something shifted in
all of us, where--

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
history about this,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.123 align:middle line:84%
but there's like
rites of passage that

00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
happens for young boys
all over the world.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.668 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And that's not set
up for young men in America

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was this point
where we were like, oh, we

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:90%
got a lot of testosterone.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.717 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you say that?

00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Testosterone, yep.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.153 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: There we go.

00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:26.819 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And there
was a lot moving.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.943 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know
what to do with it.

00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And once again, whether
it was all the movies,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
all the television
shows, all the music,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
it was saying that this was it.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a very
huge example, right there,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
of how impactful
those movies can

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
be, the music can be to
young, influential minds.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.107 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We think
it's not, but there's

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:84%
such a huge responsibility
that the filmmakers have.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
And they don't get it.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember hearing a report
about the Santa Barbara

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
shooting, and that
that particular boy was

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.205 align:middle line:84%
the son of a filmmaker
of a very violent film.

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He was a
member of the AD crew.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just remembered,
god, there's so much impact

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
that movies have on us.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
20, 30 years ago, it was
nowhere near that violent.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see 200, 300 people

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
as of right now, you take
these-- for instance,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.085 align:middle line:90%
a five-year-old little boy.

00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And you tell him,
big boys don't cry.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.762 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:57.762 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:90%

>>SMILES: Go back out there.

00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:04.435 align:middle line:84%
And you take that same little

00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, mama,
what happened to you?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Did he hurt you?

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And you teach her
emotional intelligence.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.831 align:middle line:84%
You teach her to
process her feelings.

00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And you take that
same five-year-old

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.611 align:middle line:90%
and make him a 10-year-old.

00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Then you take that
same 10-year-old,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:90%
make him a 15-year-old.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
By that time, he doesn't
even know where it is.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.633 align:middle line:84%
He only knows how to process
it in two ways, which

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:26.705 align:middle line:90%
is sports and anger.

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So then you take
that 15-year-old

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and make him a 23-year-old.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, you try to match
him up with a woman who's

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
been taught to
process her feelings,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to have an issue.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.042 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that
I've been working-- exactly.

00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've been

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, long story
short, by the time

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I was 15 I was smoking weed and
drinking and doing, you know,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
silly things that kids do
sometimes, based on society

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and whatever was set up for me.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.506 align:middle line:84%
And I had this friend
Scott-- Scott and Rudy,

00:08:21.506 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and there was a whole crew.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And we would hang out and we
would hop in this blue Astro

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
van, because they were a year
older than me and they had

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
their license.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And we'd steal alcohol.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
We'd go in the store,
take it, run out.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd sit somewhere and
drink it and just be stupid.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
Well, on this
particular night, Scott

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
called me and asked me to
come out like he always did.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first time that
I had experienced intuition,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because something
told me not to go.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you know what?

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Nope, have no clue.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You weren't under

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:53.915 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: No.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:54.956 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just said no.

00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I was able to go.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
There was something
that said don't go.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And that higher self that I now
call god voice said, don't go.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I haven't
mentioned here

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is my father, who
I haven't mentioned

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
in any of these stories.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:84%
My father, when I was
very young, sat me down,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and he said-- he
caught me smoking weed.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I know
you're going to be a boy.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
stop you from doing that.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But I want you know
that you're a leader.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And if there's ever a point when
something doesn't feel right,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
you go the other way, because
that's what leaders do.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.815 align:middle line:90%
So he set that up for me.

00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was beautiful.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that was
great, great advice.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.504 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: So here
we go, years later.

00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm 15, and there's this
thing where I'm like,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't feel right.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.347 align:middle line:90%
I'm not gonna go.

00:09:43.347 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Ah, you're going to
be a [MAKES BEEP].

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yeah, I am today.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.641 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going.

00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll catch you tomorrow.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Within an hour, every single
person in that car was shot.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And Scott was shot in the
head and died immediately.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you find that out?

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I got a

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.661 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:05.672 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I was on my
way to a basketball game.

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is
interesting, because it

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first
times I had ever

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.364 align:middle line:84%
allowed myself to feel what
it feels like to be hurt.

00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
We were on our way
to a basketball game,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and this was when they
had car phones in the car.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
attached to the-- yeah.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And my dad
picked up the phone

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:90%
and he handed it to my mom.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.429 align:middle line:84%
And this is when they were
friendly with each other.

00:10:25.429 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:90%
But they weren't back together.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle line:90%
And her voice changed.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:90%
And then she-- she said hello.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
She talked to someone, and
then she handed me the phone.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.153 align:middle line:84%
And the person on the line-- I
don't even remember who it was.

00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
They said, you know Scott?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Scott's gone.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
distinctly going, OK.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for telling me.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And then I gave the phone back.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And I just sat there.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.967 align:middle line:90%
And my mom said, you OK?

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk about it?

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.502 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go to the game.

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no, I want to go.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to go.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:90%
So we get to the game.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We're doing what we
always do, but there's

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:90%
something ruminating.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And the first play of the
game, the ball goes up.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It gets tapped to me.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I go to the basket
to shoot a layup.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.576 align:middle line:90%
I get fouled.

00:11:09.576 --> 00:11:11.827 align:middle line:84%
And in basketball, you line
up at the free throw line.

00:11:11.827 --> 00:11:12.784 align:middle line:90%
They give you the ball.

00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:90%
You shoot.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
So the ref gives me the ball.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.654 align:middle line:90%
I take one dribble, two dribble.

00:11:17.654 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The third dribble, I
fell on the ground.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I collapsed.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.541 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And my mom
ran out on the court.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.084 align:middle line:84%

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because I wondered
why I was saved.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I wondered why
wasn't I in the car?

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I was there the night before.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But not only why were
you saved, but the impact

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
of the grieving of
all of those friends--

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was the first thought to
you how was-- why was I saved?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Or was the first thought
to you, oh my god, I just

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.710 align:middle line:90%
lost my best friend.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I do not remember.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
those had been-- they

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
were ruminating,
even at his funeral.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't cry at his funeral.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I couldn't-- I didn't
know how to access it again.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.887 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this goes
very deep of don't cry.

00:12:20.887 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It goes really deep.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Very much so.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is one of
the things you teach now.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.182 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you teach
to access that higher self?

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Because undoubtedly, you've
been asking yourself ever

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
since then, why was I saved?

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Why was I not in that car?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Did you try to find that voice?

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Did try to find that god self?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Did you try to find that
intuition and tap back into it?

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.835 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: No, not initially.

00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: But I
did-- it did empower

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
me to continue to listen
when it did come through.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't mention is a
few weeks after that happened,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I asked my dad, could I leave?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.144 align:middle line:90%
I said, I need to go.

00:13:00.144 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I need to be somewhere else.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I need to go to a
different school.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Something needs to
change, because that's

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to me.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, give
me a couple days.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up on a plane
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I got off the plane.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
There was a sign
with my name on it.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And that
was my new mom.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.658 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Shirley Russell.

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And she's still one of
my mothers to this day.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And she took me in.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And she lives-- happened to
live in one of the best school

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
districts in the country.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: So I ended up
going to North Allegheny High

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
School, which at the time
was this expansive college

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:42.274 align:middle line:84%
campus-looking high school
with 100% all Caucasian.

00:13:42.274 --> 00:13:44.522 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was amazing.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.521 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: It was amazing.

00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You fit right in.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%
You just rolled with it, right?

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.413 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:50.232 align:middle line:90%
I went with it.

00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I totally went with it.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
shock at first,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
because I was just like
wait, I was just in a school

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
where they would set
the carpet on fire

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.867 align:middle line:84%
and there was no lockers
because people would put things

00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in them that they
weren't supposed to.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And now here I am in
this state of the art,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
beautiful masterpiece
of a school

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's operating
at a certain level.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.989 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what did you do?

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I went with it.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most beautiful things

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's changed my
life forever and it's

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
why I'm sitting on
this couch today,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
because I realized and
recognized something

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.534 align:middle line:90%
in that time.

00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the
words for it then,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but I knew it in
my internal being.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.052 align:middle line:90%
I knew it with all of my being.

00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was this.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I had this moment where I
was out with these kids.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.657 align:middle line:90%
And we were in-- I forget.

00:14:37.657 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
I think his name was Brad.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We were in his BMW, and we were
zooming around these corners.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.177 align:middle line:84%
And we were listening
to Outkast at the time.

00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:47.385 align:middle line:84%
And he was drinking a beer
and everybody was smoking.

00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had stopped at this
point, because I was like, OK,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:90%
something's got to change here.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had this realization that
the kids at my former school

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
in LA were smoking
weed, drinking,

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
listening to Outkast,
Biggie, and Tupac,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and then the kids at
North Allegheny High

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
were smoking weed, drinking,
listening to Outkast, Biggie,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.199 align:middle line:90%
and Tupac.

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They were doing the
same things but getting

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
an entire different result based
on the expectation of them.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So one school set it up where
this is what you're doing,

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:84%
but really, you're going
to Ivy League schools

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
change the world.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And the other school,
doing the same thing,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:84%
but all we're showing them
is that you're nothing

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.224 align:middle line:90%
and you'll never be anything.

00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so how did this
change your perspective,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:90%
your reality at that moment?

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
How did that change?

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.339 align:middle line:84%
What decision did you
make at that time?

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: The first thing I made
was that we're all the same.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We have these constructs of
being different and separate,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.030 align:middle line:84%
but in reality,
we're all the same.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:48.285 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: These dudes were
just like any other dudes

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I'd hang out with.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.833 align:middle line:84%
They just happened to have
less pigment in their skin.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: But the bottom
line is we were all

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:84%
subjected to the same
media, the same everything.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The difference was
was the set up.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It was the expectation of them.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was their
environment around them.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So you could take
the same person

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and put them in a
different environment,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.079 align:middle line:84%
and as we know from all
the scientific studies

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
out there now, you
could take a cell,

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
put it into a
different Petri dish

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
with a different
environment, and the cell

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
will grow to that--
it will become bone

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.885 align:middle line:90%
or it will become whatever.

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
That is absolutely beautiful
that you figured that out

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So now, you talk about this.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:90%
You teach this.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But this came from an experience
that was so deep for you.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you wind up helping any
of those kids in that school?

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.837 align:middle line:84%
Did you wind up
saying, hey, look,

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
you're throwing this away.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Did you help anyone?

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I did.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I went back.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: It was too cold
in Pittsburgh for me.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, all
right, tapping out.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.259 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna go back to California.

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:90%

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I ended up going not
back to that school.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:90%
I went to San Pedro High School.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.622 align:middle line:84%
And I gathered-- I ended up--
I attract people no matter

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.705 align:middle line:84%
where I go, because it's
a part where I come from.

00:17:05.705 --> 00:17:06.794 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, really?

00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:08.133 align:middle line:90%
You'd never know.

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:08.633 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:08.633 --> 00:17:09.056 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:09.056 --> 00:17:09.556 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:09.556 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I attracted
this awesome crew.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:90%
And, like, we--

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very cool.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: We still did silly
things, but it changed.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Everything changed from there.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I will say that one of my best
friends when I was growing up

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
is still, to this day, hooked
on heroin and running around.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And he's not in a good place.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And I reach out to
him all the time.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:90%
He's been in and out of jail.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.969 align:middle line:84%
And this is somebody,
like I said--

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and I could get choked up
right now thinking about it--

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
literally, I've known him
since I was five years old.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
We grew up in the
same neighborhood.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason
and every reason

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:90%
why he is where he is right now.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I do understand
that we have choice.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, but I get
what you're saying.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
That statistic of 99%
of the kids in prison

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
have traumatic, deeply
traumatic, childhoods.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So you made a choice, and
he can make a choice, too.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But what gives you
the ingredients

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to make the choices that
you did and not him?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.935 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm asking.

00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
What it is?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.706 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I know what it is.

00:18:08.706 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It's that conversation
my dad set up for me.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't have a
dad to say that to him.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:90%
My dad did the same thing.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:84%
The law of expectancy-- he
set a principal in place.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:90%
You are a leader.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And he had me make the choice.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say, you can't do
this and you can't do that.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know you're
going to be a boy,

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
but know that if something
doesn't feel right,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
you can go that way
while everyone else is

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:90%
going that way.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I saw you in an audience
say thank you to him

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
and that he was your hero.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I saw that.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.203 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at one of the videos

00:18:42.203 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
here with Preston Smiles
talking about the Love Mob.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.969 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:18:46.969 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: So I go by
Preston Smiles as a reminder

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter what my
job title is, my real job

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:90%
is to show up as love.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So this talk today is about
doing what we as a society

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
always figure out
one way or another--

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that while it would
be awesome to take

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
our iPhones and our BMWs
and our houses to the grave

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with us, that we
actually can't do that,

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and that the only thing that
matters when it's said and done

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is whether you've
loved and been loved.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So my hope is that I
leave you with some tools

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to ignite and inspire you to
turn the volume up on your life

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and love louder.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.812 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit about
where I come from

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and the context in
which I'm speaking-- I

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.419 align:middle line:84%
am the founder-- the
co-founder of the Love Mob.

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Are there any Love
Mobbers in the building?

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.106 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS]

00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a social movement
dedicating to spreading love

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
all over the world through
organized acts of love.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We do that through
giant flash mobs

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and different love-based events.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And our take on it
is that it takes--

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
let me show you a
couple pictures.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:90%
That's our symbol.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It takes a village
to raise a village.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And as the old African proverb
states, if you want to go fast,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:90%
go alone.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
go far, go together.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:90%
So that is exactly what we do.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that on the surface,
I appear to be this

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
6'2" beautiful chocolate
drop of a man, right?

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I realize it.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
But in reality, I am love.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I am energy in a space.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I am vibration and frequency.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know the same for
each and every one of you.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
teach people, now,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:84%
what you've learned
from your experiences.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And you put it into
kind of a three step

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
or a formula or
something like that

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
just so that people
could grasp it.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
You just taught at Esalen
this last weekend, right?

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I did.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What were you teaching?

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Well, I speak about
loving louder-- the idea.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.566 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I do this
hashtag #lovesvoice,

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that we're
all love's voice, that we're

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
all representatives of love,
and that when we step into that

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and we love louder, when we
turn the volume up on our lives

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and on our love, it
reverberates everywhere.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And how you do that--

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
was my next question.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: --is changing
our relationship

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.942 align:middle line:84%
with risk, with celebration,
and with responsibility.

00:21:42.942 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So risk-- there's risks that are
taken every single day-- when

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
you say yes to something,
when you say no to something.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.705 align:middle line:90%
That's full of risks.

00:21:52.705 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you not--

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
How are you not
afraid of change?

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Because I
absolutely understand

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.552 align:middle line:90%
that it's inevitable.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's necessary.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: No one can stop that.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you just go into it?

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.113 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:06.607 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just go into change.

00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Headfirst.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Find me.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: It's not always
a comfortable thing.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But all the magic happens out
there on the skinny branches.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:90%
That's where the good fruit is.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you know when
you change one thing,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:18.817 align:middle line:90%
then everything else--

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so then
the ground disappears

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
where you're stepping--

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:90%
have you ever had that feeling?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.585 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where
everything's moving,

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
when you're making big change?

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when you
put the foot out there

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to step on the path
that isn't even there

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.641 align:middle line:90%
yet-- you know that feeling?

00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:37.516 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.252 align:middle line:84%
What do you do if the
path never appears

00:22:40.252 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and you fall and you fail?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Well, see, I
don't believe in failure,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
so that's already
a place where I

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
would have to have a new
conversation about, because

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to me, as long as there's
breath in the body,

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely
impossible to fail.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
We're always, always a part
of the divine intelligence

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
that is operating all of us.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.692 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're co-creating
with the Creator.

00:23:07.692 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
if you're things

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
like fired, laid off, death
in the family, those things--

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:84%
they stop things
for a little while.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get
that resilience

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to bounce off if there's
no such thing as failures?

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.505 align:middle line:84%
Those things, most
people would register

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
as fail-- getting fired,
those types of things.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And the

00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
about those type of things--

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Some people come to
me about breakups.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And they
say, he's the one.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.472 align:middle line:84%
I just had a-- I won't name
this particular person,

00:23:40.472 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:90%
but this happens a lot.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:90%
So they'll say, he's the one.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm clear that that was the one.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And I don't understand.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'll ask a question.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll say, was he the first one?

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So what about Jesse
three years ago?

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
What about Brad four
years before that?

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
What about Tommy four
years before that?

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Has the universe
ever failed you?

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.255 align:middle line:90%
Or are you in a process?

00:24:01.255 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you ever evolving?

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Are you getting-- because it's
either half empty or half full

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.630 align:middle line:90%
for most people.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's
always half full.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.855 align:middle line:90%
It's always full.

00:24:09.855 --> 00:24:10.714 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:10.714 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: You see
what I'm saying?

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.671 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:16.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: So it's a reframing
of what is happening.

00:24:16.627 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've had plenty
of experience with this.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:90%
You've had plenty of adversity.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.047 align:middle line:84%
You've had plenty of
things happen in your life.

00:24:23.047 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Oh, yes, I have.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.156 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have every reason
to say that exact thing.

00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a great
video here I want

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
people to watch about--
well, I looked at it

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:90%
as type A personalities.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
paralysis of analysis.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
that overachievers do and get

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.867 align:middle line:90%
paralyzed by our control.

00:24:44.867 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I talk about it
in the first person here.

00:24:49.145 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I feel you.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.012 align:middle line:90%
That's why I made it.

00:24:51.012 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't make any videos that
I'm not actually experiencing.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Good to know, because you didn't
look like you experienced it.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.544 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this video of
the paralysis of analysis.

00:25:01.544 --> 00:25:03.999 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Woohoo!

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So this is for all my analyzers.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I feel you.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a chicken
waiting to cross the road,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:90%
but she can't make a decision.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
She's waiting to cross the
road, but she's not clear

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
if she should cross now
or when the light's green

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
or when the light's yellow
or when her makeup is better

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.877 align:middle line:84%
or when she has a better
job or when things

00:25:36.877 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
are a little better, when she
makes a little more money.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You see, that chicken
died of starvation.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It's called paralysis of
analysis-- so many decisions

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that you make no decision, so
many choices, so many options

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.765 align:middle line:90%
that you make no decision.

00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In our culture right now, we're
so obsessed with the finished

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:90%
product.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We're so obsessed
with slam dunking

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and being the LeBron James
and all of those things.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is-- the problem is

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
we don't see all
the noes that Oprah

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
got before she got the yes.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the nights in the
gym with Kobe Bryant shooting

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:90%
those free throws.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't see Steve
Jobs being fired

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:90%
from his own damn company.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You see, all of this
stuff, all of these things,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
we're so obsessed
with the end result

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that we miss the fact that
failure is a key component.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:90%
You want to win?

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:90%
You want to win?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:90%
You gotta to start failing.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:90%
You gotta do.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:90%
You gotta jump.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:90%
You gotta get in the damn game.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You see, this life-- this
life is about experience.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Life honors the live-r.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have a lot
of energy in my body

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm moving, but
guess what I'm doing?

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:90%
You gotta do something.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You gotta step up in
your life and jump.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So many people are sitting
on the fence of life

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.852 align:middle line:84%
watching and waiting and trying
to figure out if it's time.

00:27:07.852 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's never gonna
be the right time.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The right time is now--
now, now, now, now, now--

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:90%
every time.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait for the right
job with the perfect mate

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:90%
or the right money.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I gotta pay my mortgage
off before I live.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take that trip
two years from now when I

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:90%
get the right job.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Live it now, because
you never know.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
You never know when
that day comes.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
We all have an
expiration date, y'all.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
it too many times

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
where people die with
the dance still in them.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to die with
our dance still in us, y'all.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
You want to die with it
all out on the field.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
You want to know that you
left it all out on the field.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And how do we do that?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
We stop thinking so much
and get in our damn bodies.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Live it.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Be it.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
How awesome is
this life we have?

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:90%
We just got to choose it.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:90%
We got to choose the love.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Today, I ask you one thing.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to fall in
love with failure.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Do one thing, right?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key right here.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Wherever your comfort zone is--
if your comfort zone is a four,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking you, I'm
challenging you to go to a six.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Do anything that
is a six-- today.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.025 align:middle line:90%
Do it now.

00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:90%

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:84%
This life is about love,
nothing more, nothing less.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I am Preston Smiles.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:90%
This is Questions with Preston.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:53.369 align:middle line:90%

00:28:53.369 --> 00:29:00.656 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where do you get
that kind of inspiration?

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:90%
You just free float.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.995 align:middle line:84%
It's like you were
preaching on the beach.

00:29:08.995 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I did not write that.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You came up-- that
just came through you.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Does this happen all day?

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: It does.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.135 align:middle line:84%
It does, because
I'm looking for it.

00:29:18.135 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
You always get what
you're looking for.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But if-- OK, so
you said to me earlier

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that it's all the same thing.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all love.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Everything.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how does this divine
inspiration come in and then

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.830 align:middle line:84%
make it different from
this divine inspiration?

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Your feel of your
videos are so great,

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because you are just-- you
draw people in and stuff.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:90%
But where do you get the spark?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get that from
day after day after day

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
if what you're
really talking about

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
is all the same thing, Preston?

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- and I would
call you one of these

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
as well-- that back in
the day, the universe

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:90%
would birth way showers.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Every couple 50 years,
every 100 years,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
they would pop up a Mother
Teresa and a Gandhi and then

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:90%
a Martin Luther King.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It would pop these people up--
the Nikolai Teslas and things

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.485 align:middle line:84%
I think that the universe
is speeding that up.

00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that the planet
is calling for a lot of us

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
to jump up, to get up, and
get fired up about our lives

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
so that, then-- because we're
always a walking context.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm always teaching you how to
be with me based on who I am.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in these
videos and in these inspirations

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.062 align:middle line:84%
is that I'll be with
something, knowing

00:30:37.062 --> 00:30:39.145 align:middle line:84%
that love is all there is,
and I'm like, OK, well,

00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
if love is all there is,
if that's the truth--

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about this?

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.691 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Yes, because
there's a difference

00:30:44.691 --> 00:30:47.710 align:middle line:90%
between the facts and the truth.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:84%
The facts could be one thing,
but the truth of the matter is

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm an ageless,
deathless, changeless being

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
made in the image
and likeness of god.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth of me.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
The facts are that I
can't pay my rent or

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:84%
blank, blank, blank, blank,
blank or she hurt me,

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
he hurt me or ah, I want
to jump but I'm afraid

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:84%
because if I do then
what if this happens

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and-- I call all that
the small S of the self.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And my come from is to
speak from the capital S,

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.787 align:middle line:90%
from the big S, from the big P.

00:31:24.787 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take somebody who comes

>>SMILES: Yes.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure
this has happened.

>>SMILES: It has.

00:31:31.018 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you get them
to the capital S?

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I get under
what's really there,

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
because most of the
time, people are

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.269 align:middle line:90%
talking about circumstances.

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, got it.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.684 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: And
circumstantial happiness,

00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial anything--
it's transitory.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not here to stay.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Coming from

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:90%
So I hear them.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I actually let it land.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.875 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, so
what's going on?

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, you know, this
happened and this happened

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and then they took my kid
or whatever that looks like.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And I say, wow.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.756 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:90%
You're a powerful being.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.655 align:middle line:84%
And I'll speak to
the higher self.

00:32:08.655 --> 00:32:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll speak to who they
really are, and say, listen.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to talk
you out of anything.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.550 align:middle line:90%
I just want to hear you.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to be with you.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.815 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll get them
to start reframing,

00:32:20.815 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
get them to start reframing.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a cost
for everything.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything we say, do,
be-- there's a cost for it.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And I get them to get to the
point where it's like, OK,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
so what will this cost
me if I-- what will it

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.390 align:middle line:84%
cost my mom, my
sister, my brother if I

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:90%
make this decision?

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And do I want to
leave them with that?

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
a conversation that

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make people
keep coming back to you

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.041 align:middle line:84%
and relying on you to
give them their happiness

00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:52.790 align:middle line:90%
or be their coach.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I don't
want that ever.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It would be perfect if
neither one of us had a job.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Then the universe could just
provide it a different way.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.515 align:middle line:84%
I have lots of
talents and gifts,

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:05.089 align:middle line:90%
and I know you do as well.

00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: It's necessary
for me to be this now.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's necessary for
you to bring this through.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I jumped on
that train too with you.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I know that this isn't my
beginning of whatever I'm

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:90%
doing on this planet right now.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.440 align:middle line:90%
I heard the call.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.956 align:middle line:84%
It was there long before me and
it will be here long after me.

00:33:25.956 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I jumped on it.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.025 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:32.025 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And many, many
people are jumping

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
on this train of consciousness,
because it is huge.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.575 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's getting
bigger and bigger, not faster,

00:33:41.575 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:90%
but bigger.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:42.853 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:33:42.853 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, maybe faster.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about how
to deal with adversity when

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:84%
someone comes to you and
says, I want to end my life

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:84%
or this-- stuff
happens that is brutal.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And you somehow have a
way of transforming them.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:84%
What happens if that stuff
gets directed towards you,

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
where someone says,
you know, what do you--

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:84%
how do you know what
you're talking about,

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:84%
or anybody from
your past says, I

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:84%
don't want you to be as
bright as you are, and wants

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
to take away your light?

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.337 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever deal with that?

00:34:13.337 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.194 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:15.069 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.323 align:middle line:90%
So are you afraid of that?

00:34:20.323 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Fear
comes up sometimes.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.224 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: But it's not
something I entertain.

00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:27.209 align:middle line:84%
I don't dance with
fear for too long.

00:34:27.209 --> 00:34:29.993 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there
is anyone, including

00:34:29.993 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:84%
Nelson Mandela or anybody
who's done anything great,

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.770 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been afraid.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It's their conversation with
fear that makes the difference.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And my conversation with fear is
like, you're not here to stay.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
And I give fear an eviction
letter over and over again

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and bring back the truth.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So the truth is is that
energy can never die.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.409 align:middle line:84%
So if my life were to go away,
my life wouldn't really go way.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:90%
I would transmute.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I would turn into
something else.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But in between that
time-- because we all

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.551 align:middle line:84%
have one of those dates
where we're no longer going

00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to be in this form--
in between that time,

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to, what I like to
say, go hard in the paint.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.737 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an
old basketball term.

00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:15.195 align:middle line:84%
When you go hard
in the paint, that

00:35:15.195 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:90%
means you give it your all.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: My idea is to
leave the tank on empty.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.936 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm done with this
car, I gave it everything.

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you do
that every day?

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.226 align:middle line:84%
Or are you going to do
that for your lifetime?

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.317 align:middle line:90%
Do you give all every day?

00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I attempt to.

00:35:31.275 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I attempt to, yeah.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can tell.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this video
here, where Preston's

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about how
he handles haters

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.310 align:middle line:90%
and how we can handle the same.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Misery
really enjoys company,

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:90%
because haters gonna hate.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.726 align:middle line:90%
Haters-- [VOICE SLOWS DOWN].

00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.030 align:middle line:90%
So here's the deal.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.059 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're doing
anything that people deem good

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
or in the public
eye, there are going

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
to be people that come
that try to chop you down.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:90%
This happens in churches.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It happens in politics.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It happens everywhere--
at work, in relationship.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
we must embody,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.860 align:middle line:84%
the thing that we must
understand and use

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is a knowingness that it's
never really about us--

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that haters hate because
they're confused admirers,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
that haters have a lack and
limitation consciousness,

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.510 align:middle line:84%
so they believe that what's
yours is actually theirs.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.944 align:middle line:90%
Our job is to love them anyway.

00:36:32.944 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:84%
People say, haters gonna
hate, and they hate haters.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's more hate.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Hate is very heavy.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.980 align:middle line:84%
When you are carrying
hate, you hurt

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:90%
you more than you hurt them.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we understand
that love is all there is.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And if love is all there is,
then our response to hate

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:84%
is to be love, is to
recognize the love in them

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and understand that there is
high thought and low thought.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And within low thought
creates lack and limitation

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and not enough.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And from not enough,
it would have

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.680 align:middle line:84%
somebody believe that what's
mine is actually theirs.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But we choose-- champions,
warriors of the light,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%
we choose to be in high thought.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
High thought says, what's
mine is mine is mine--

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a universe
full of abundance,

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing in
between my good, right?

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And we view haters--
quote, unquote haters--

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
with eyes of love
and compassion.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was in college, I used
to run around this blond mohawk

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:90%
and this pink skateboard, right?

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And I would fly through campus.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And all the football
players and the frat guys

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and different people
would hate on me.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.795 align:middle line:84%
And before I was more
evolved, I would hate back.

00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like, what
you looking at?

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have all
of this tension.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
within that that I

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
get to shift my energy
and my consciousness.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing them
with eyes of compassion.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
These guys grew up
in a society that

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
says that men must
be strong and brutes

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.844 align:middle line:84%
and not wear pink
and blah, blah, blah

00:38:06.844 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and all of this stuff.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw them from there
and dealt with that in me,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:90%
it shifted them.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.670 align:middle line:84%
When I shifted me,
it shifted them.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Today, I challenge
you, this week, I

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.470 align:middle line:84%
challenge you to keep your eye
on the prize and your energy

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:84%
in the now and float like a
butterfly and sting like a bee,

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:84%
because it is very hard
to hit a moving target.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't hit me if
I'm still moving.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm moving from love.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving from presence.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving, knowing that I can
never be in the wrong place.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm always in the right
place at the right time,

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:90%
because I serve.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that the
universe moves ahead of me,

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
listening to my
innermost thoughts.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:84%
In that video, you said
something very, very important.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.530 align:middle line:84%
You said you shifted
you-- when you

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.932 align:middle line:84%
were wearing pink and riding
the skateboard and stuff.

00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you said something
a bit earlier, too, here.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You said, you are teaching
me how to relate to you.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Right now, in this conversation,
you-- and I'm mirroring.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:90%
You're giving me so much here.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.269 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a tricky question.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That-- how
do you do that?

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: How do you shift you?

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.838 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: You change
the questions.

00:39:31.838 --> 00:39:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
When you ask big,
empowering questions,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.890 align:middle line:90%
you get big, empowering answers.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask questions
or when I ask questions like,

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.652 align:middle line:84%
why me, there's always
going to be an answer to it.

00:39:46.652 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
to ask the question,

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
there's an answer
already waiting.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.143 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So I ask questions like what
good is here that I presently

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.570 align:middle line:90%
cannot see?

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.673 align:middle line:84%
So when you were riding around
in the skateboard with the pink

00:39:58.673 --> 00:40:03.166 align:middle line:84%
and you were getting all that
harassment, how did you--

00:40:03.166 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you had to put that shirt
on in the morning knowing

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.373 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to get
that type of attention.

00:40:07.373 --> 00:40:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yep.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you trained
them how to treat you?

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of bullies,
kids who are bullied.

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a big piece here.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:84%
How do they transform, and
how do you transform who you

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and shift who you
are being in order

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to train the other
people how to treat you?

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: That
comes back to how--

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to confidence and the belief
and the knowingness of what

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I came here to do and be.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
connected, as we know.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are no small
acts in the universe.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
An ant, an elephant--
all of them

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:84%
in the eye of god, in the eye of
the universe, is all the same.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So me wearing a pink shirt
or me standing on a pulpit

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:90%
is all the same thing.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all the divine intelligence
speaking through, in,

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and as me.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I don't take
those things lightly.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So if-- it's like the
people who decided to go

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.877 align:middle line:84%
get coffee one hour before
the first plane hit at 9/11.

00:41:13.877 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.793 align:middle line:90%
The ones that left the building.

00:41:15.793 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The people who missed
their flight-- there

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.200 align:middle line:90%
are no coincidences.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything is connected.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you're listening to
god voice, intuition, the higher

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:31.830 align:middle line:84%
self, you will always be
guided in the right direction.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: I got that call.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, Scott.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.444 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna chill.

00:41:38.444 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna stay home tonight.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you
do that night, anyway?

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I just stayed
around the house.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nothing.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Watched National Geographic
or something like that.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But that, to me, that is the
same thing as the pink shirt,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:90%
is the same thing as everything.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.249 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:41:51.249 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: As long
as you're listening

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:84%
to higher self, to intuition,
to god voice, you can do,

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:90%
you can go no wrong.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.699 align:middle line:90%
It's all lined up.

00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's interesting,
because you didn't necessarily

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.280 align:middle line:84%
have a purpose you were attached
to at that time at 15 years

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.087 align:middle line:90%
old in your life.

00:42:05.087 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have a bigger
picture you were going towards.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So in that whole idea
of you need a purpose,

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:84%
you need a purpose wasn't
necessarily what happened.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.414 align:middle line:90%
You just listened to that voice.

00:42:14.414 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even know
what the voice was.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yep.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:17.553 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just listened.

00:42:17.553 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:84%
It was your first
experience with intuition.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all of this
rhetoric of you need a purpose.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You need a-- it's good, but
the first step to everything

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.170 align:middle line:90%
would be what?

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Just
recognizing the self,

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.610 align:middle line:84%
recognizing what it is that
you actually are, because I do

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:90%
believe in purpose.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:90%
I just believe in purposes.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't think my mom just
came here to have me.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I think she came here
to do a million things.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:90%
But that was one of them.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:90%
That was on the list.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
is going to have--

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:84%
things are going
to come through.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: I'm of
the thought process

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that god wants what
we want-- that god

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:90%
is it saying, hey, listen, guys.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:90%
There's one power.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.400 align:middle line:84%
What you do with that
one power is up to you.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You can either create
holocaust and make slaves

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and do all kinds of crazy
stuff and create wars

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.085 align:middle line:84%
in Iraq and everywhere
else with that power.

00:43:17.085 --> 00:43:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Or you can create harmony.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:90%
You can create peace.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You can have them look back
100, 200 years from now and say,

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.380 align:middle line:90%
they turned the ship.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.740 align:middle line:84%
They changed the
direction of the ship.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're up to.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they all created a
different-- a whole different

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.120 align:middle line:84%

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%

What you were speaking about

to the men, the boys, and

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.780 align:middle line:90%

because that's how
we're told to be.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIO OUT] fact that we were
taught something unnatural.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.560 align:middle line:90%

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Big boys do cry.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Real men do cry.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we laugh and we
dance and we play

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and we feel and we allow
ourselves to be human.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Too long in this
society, we have

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.270 align:middle line:84%
been taught that men
need to hold strong.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But what does strong
mean is the question.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm challenging what strong is.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Strong to me, a real man to me
allows himself to be affected,

00:45:03.796 --> 00:45:07.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot happening
in this world right now.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is
because men haven't

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.100 align:middle line:90%
learned to be with each other.

There's another way to
deal with this besides war,

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.610 align:middle line:84%

guns, besides shooting.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught
something unnatural.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to reverse that.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It is time, men especially,
to stand up and allow

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.570 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to feel.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in a
cafe the other day.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching
this YouTube video

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:90%
of soldiers returning home.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I start to get emotional.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I wasn't
gonna allow it to come out.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, you know what?

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:53.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm feeling.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the work.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And my two boys kind of
gestured towards me, asking me,

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.340 align:middle line:90%
was I OK?

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah, I'm good, man.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- it reminded me of
all of the repressed childhood

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.530 align:middle line:84%
feelings and of
all the times where

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted to
cry, but instead I fought.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I wanted my
dad to pick me up and tell me

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.390 align:middle line:84%
it would be OK, but
instead, I bottled it up.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Too many of us are
dying on the inside,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
pretending like
everything is good.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm here to tell you
that your friends, your family,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.915 align:middle line:84%
your mothers, your fathers,
your daughters, we all feel it.

00:46:38.915 --> 00:46:40.970 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Allow it out, because it's going
to come out one way or another.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's time for a change, y'all.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that change has
to start with us.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Step up.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Check yourself before you wreck
yourself from the inside out.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Love is all there is.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow ourselves
to feel that and be that,

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.790 align:middle line:90%
nothing can hurt us.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.855 align:middle line:84%

key to everything.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.900 align:middle line:84%

But I explain in the beginning
that this book is not

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to be read chronologically--
you would just open a page

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:90%

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.905 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

>>SMILES: Absolutely.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those things
where I recognized--

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.980 align:middle line:84%
because at the time, I was
pursuing an acting career,

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and a friend of
mine was in my home

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and he was in my meditation
room that I had set up.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, dude,
it's interesting.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You're like an actor, but
like, all your books are

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.860 align:middle line:84%
like metaphysics and
like spiritual stuff.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.858 align:middle line:84%
He was like, why do
you have all those?

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:25.063 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, because
I love that more.

00:49:25.063 --> 00:49:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was like one
of those moments

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.580 align:middle line:84%
where I was like, ah,
that's interesting

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that I'm choosing this path, but
really, I was only choosing--

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the things
I speak about and speak to,

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.470 align:middle line:84%
because so many
of us try to go--

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:42.820 align:middle line:84%
we know that we want to head
here, but then we head there

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and there and there
to get to here.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.124 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not a big proponent
of college for the most part.

00:49:48.124 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know that'll
piss some people off.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have a master's
degree, I think it's a set up.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a money maker.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And so many people come
out, including my friends,

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.305 align:middle line:90%
and they're in debt for life.

00:49:58.305 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:90%

mindful within that.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.070 align:middle line:84%

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:50.920 align:middle line:84%
then you are not

therefore you are not honoring
life, therefore, you lose.

00:54:56.595 --> 00:54:57.841 align:middle line:90%

You want to have a happy life?

There's this stuff that

Neuropeptides send messages

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:15.740 align:middle line:84%
if you want to walk around
with a healthy shell--

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.010 align:middle line:90%
because we're all just energy.

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.051 align:middle line:90%
We're all just vibration.

00:55:18.051 --> 00:55:20.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want to change
your vibration,

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.410 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
the small stuff.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Find the funny in getting

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Find the funny in your boss

00:55:29.415 --> 00:55:32.147 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.147 --> 00:55:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know what
movie that's from.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The neuropeptides are
sending the message.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you want the message to be
good, if you want it to be fun,

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.740 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
happy, then you've

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.350 align:middle line:90%
got to send happy stuff there.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And how you do that is by being
moved, by having a great time,

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and being mindful.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Go within, or you go without.

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Be still and know
that I am-- finish it.

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all here.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all here now.

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.390 align:middle line:90%
The magic is here.

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Name the last toy you
got when you were 12.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I bet you money you can't.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.760 align:middle line:84%
That toy and your Ferrari
are the same exact thing.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.176 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much-- how many
Ferraris, no matter how many

00:56:06.176 --> 00:56:09.326 align:middle line:84%
houses you get, they will never
equal lasting fulfillment.

00:56:09.326 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
don't remember it.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You could buy 40
houses, and you'll

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
be happy for a little bit,
and then you'll be back down.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:19.060 align:middle line:84%
We are finding our happiness
in external things.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And that can never produce
lasting fulfillment.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Lasting fulfillment
happens on the inside.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.980 align:middle line:90%
It is an inside job.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be happy,
you have to play in here.

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And how you play in
here is going within,

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is meditating, is praying,
is playing, is watching,

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.930 align:middle line:84%
is being with life, and
dancing in the nuances.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It is so good to
be alive right now.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It is so good-- so, so good.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
beautiful things happening.

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:54.600 align:middle line:84%
What we appreciate appreciates--
in the micro and in the macro.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The government and all
of these terrible things

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.250 align:middle line:90%
that are happening, right?

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.100 align:middle line:90%
We can point at those.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Or we can create a new lane.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We can create a lane
that's so awesome--

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that's so awesome that everybody
wants to be a part of that.

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Go there today.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Dance in the smallness.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Taste the music.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Hear the wind.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Taste the rainbow,
like Starburst.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.677 align:middle line:84%
And nunchuck some people
if you come across them

00:57:23.677 --> 00:57:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and they ain't paying attention.

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:26.301 align:middle line:90%
This is Questions with Preston.

00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I ask that you hit Subscribe,
Like, leave a message,

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and also share this video.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Blessings and blessings.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.386 align:middle line:90%
I'm going crazy out here!

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:37.358 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:57:37.358 --> 00:57:38.816 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:57:38.816 --> 00:57:40.746 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:57:40.746 --> 00:57:41.246 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:57:41.246 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.694 align:middle line:84%
So out of that video, what is
the one thing happy people do?

00:57:48.694 --> 00:57:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.324 align:middle line:90%
I might have missed it.

00:57:50.324 --> 00:57:51.032 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Thanks.

00:57:51.032 --> 00:57:52.430 align:middle line:90%
That's nice feedback.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:53.610 align:middle line:90%
You hear that?

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:57.294 align:middle line:84%
She's basically telling me that
I missed the mark on the video.

00:57:57.294 --> 00:57:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What the heck?

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: The one
thing happy people

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.226 align:middle line:90%
do is they find the humor.

00:58:02.226 --> 00:58:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It's what you're
doing right now.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: It's what
I'm doing right now.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: It's that they find
the humor in the small things.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.580 align:middle line:90%
When I talk about that--

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: Like I said, the
old man with the ear hair,

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that was me an
hour prior to that.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in
line, I was like, there

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.667 align:middle line:84%
is a Chia pet coming
out of his ear.

00:58:19.667 --> 00:58:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing,
because I understand

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that as you get older, the
ears never stop growing.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's beautiful,
but it's hilarious, you know?

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.337 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:58:28.337 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or the dog on the grass.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yeah.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:30.710 align:middle line:90%
That's comedy.

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:31.918 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, and the broccoli.

00:58:31.918 --> 00:58:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The comments below
about the broccoli--

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Be with the broccoli.

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am the broccoli.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's that.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.475 align:middle line:84%
It's find the humor
in the little things.

00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
way you live life.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.147 align:middle line:84%
So have I left
anything out here?

00:58:46.147 --> 00:58:47.646 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else that you want

00:58:47.646 --> 00:58:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to-- I know there's
a ton to say.

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to just pour
one last message into us,

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.250 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: There's
two tiers to it.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:05.320 align:middle line:84%
One, I would say that if--
for anybody out there, I do

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.440 align:middle line:84%
have an amazing online
coaching program

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.694 align:middle line:90%
that's about to come out.

00:59:09.694 --> 00:59:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
the Bridge Method.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's the bridge between
spirituality and transformation

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and personal development work.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.526 align:middle line:84%
So that I would love to be
out, because it's awesome.

00:59:20.526 --> 00:59:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It's my girlfriend
and I-- Alexi Panos.

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And we put our combined
20-something years' worth

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of study-- because she's
a nerd like I am, too--

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:32.220 align:middle line:84%
into this all-inclusive
package that's awesome,

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.187 align:middle line:84%
which we would love to
connect with you about.

00:59:35.187 --> 00:59:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So you're bridging spirituality
and personal development.

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.223 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes.

00:59:39.223 --> 00:59:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.777 align:middle line:84%
Those are two
different worlds that

00:59:42.777 --> 00:59:44.110 align:middle line:90%
talk about the same exact thing.

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Same thing.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:46.010 align:middle line:90%
You are absolutely right.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Mm-hmm.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Very, very
perceptive of you.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:48.677 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:59:48.677 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Thank you.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:50.843 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the other thing was?

00:59:50.843 --> 00:59:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMILES: The other thing
is love will find a way.

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
will find an excuse.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being with
me, for hanging out with us.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMILES: Yes, this was awesome.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.261 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Here on Gaiam TV.

01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like
to share this interview

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.277 align:middle line:84%
with your friends, you
can go to gaiamtv.com,

01:00:05.277 --> 01:00:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and you can share it from there.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:10.205 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

01:00:10.205 --> 01:00:25.800 align:middle line:90%
