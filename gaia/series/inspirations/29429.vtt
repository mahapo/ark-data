[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Laura Alden Kamm has the
vision of an x-ray machine.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:10%
It began as a child,
was strengthened

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:10%
through a near death
experience, and is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:10%
tapped into today by
some of the top people

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:10%
in the field of medicine.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
Her vision extends far
beyond the human body,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
however, which is why I
wanted to talk with her today.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We have some unique challenges
and opportunities coming up

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
for us as a species,
and Laura has

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
a unique perspective
on how we can

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
tap into this field ourselves.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Teaching others how to be their
own intuitive is her passion,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and I feel very lucky to
have her here with us today.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good
to see you again.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
The last time we did this
was about five years ago.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know.
Thank you.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The world has changed
considerably since then.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is speeding up
just a bit, isn't it?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Just a little tad.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.771 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody watching this
can feel that at this moment.

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do for
the people that don't know

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
you yet is have you
give a little bit

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of your own
background, because I

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
love the stories
from your childhood,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
when this all began for you.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.731 align:middle line:84%
So give us a little-- you're
a midwest girl, right?

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
-I am.
-OK.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how this all started,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and how you started
playing with energy.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in a very
small town, about 15,000,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:10%
in southeastern Ohio.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And every spring, my first
memories are of this.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:10%
So every spring I'd put my
little red rubber boots,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:10%
you know, the kind that
you strap on to the side.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'd walk out, late
February and March,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:10%
and I'd march up and down
the perimeter of the yard,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:10%
because I could sense
the tulips and the crocus

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:10%
and the day lilies and
things ready to emerge

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:10%
from the ground.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course I didn't
have that kind of language.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I was only four
and five years old.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But I would just
relentlessly, every day,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.510 align:middle line:84%
multiple times a day, go up and
down the yard waiting for them.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And we had a huge
willow tree in our yard,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and my brother was very
skillful with the other boys

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood and built
a magnificent treehouse.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:84%
So I would climb up in there
with my blanket, at least

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.438 align:middle line:84%
on the low level.
-Right.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
The lower limbs for the girls.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
The lower limbs for the girls,
yes, and my saltine crackers.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would sit there
on the rainy days,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and I would look through the
branches of the willow tree,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and I could sense-- I used
to play with the branches.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I could sense where the
buds were coming out.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And I would wait.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would do this
for months on end.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And your own hands.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
You would watch the energy
coming out of your own hands

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.751 align:middle line:84%
when you were
touching these things.

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most fun memories
I have is, we also had lilacs.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have my
hands around the lilac bush

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
ready when it was
ready to bloom.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the light coming
out of my hands and my body.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Not just my hands, my body.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Just as I see it coming out
of all of your beautiful

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
radiance right now
as we sit here.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And the lilacs were
ready to bloom,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and I just didn't understand
why did I have light coming

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
from me, and why did
the bushes and the trees

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
have it coming from them?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
We were both from God,
I believed at that time,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and still do.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And why do we look different?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I didn't get it.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I just-- of course,
I was a little girl.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
What happened
when you-- did you

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:90%
talk to other people about it?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.245 align:middle line:84%
Did you ask your parents
about, what is that light

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and what are the colors
coming from the plants?

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Or did something in you
know that that wasn't

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
something you could share?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid to share it.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It just never dawned
on me to say anything,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
because we were a really
pretty playful family.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I have an older
brother, older sister,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
at the time when
I was that young,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and then I have a sister
12 years my junior now.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But we were always just playing
in the yard and the woods,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and I thought everybody
else was like this.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
other intuitives

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and students and clients.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have
similar stories.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're all connected.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you don't know
that it's anything different--

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really almost on the
opposite pole, I couldn't see.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But I was very
quiet and withdrawn,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.545 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't speak that
much with other people

00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and had no idea that I was blind
until I was about 11 years old,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see anything.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
No one else knew I couldn't
see either, because I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:90%
thought it was normal, right?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And the first really
poignant memories

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that were actually
frightening to me

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:90%
happened when I was eight.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
My father's a
Presbyterian minister.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And he was privileged to
receive a five-month sabbatical

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in Western Europe.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
My mother, being a smart
woman, knew that he

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:90%
was not going to go without us.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So we saved pennies and dimes
and nickels and quarters

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and made this lovely trip, this
amazing trip over to Europe.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So my father being
an historian as well,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
we went to the battlefields
of Normandy and Verdun.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh god, how awful for
a little intuitive.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was,
because I would feel

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:90%
the concussion of the bombs.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I could smell the smoke.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I could hear the screams.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
something, and this

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
is when my mother,
god love her, started

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.701 align:middle line:84%
saying, Laurie, you have
the most vivid imagination.

00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, of course.
-So you know, there you go.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But the one that got me the
most was Dachau, when we went

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
in there, and the gas chambers.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And I ran out of there
as fast as I could.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You can still hear it,
kind of, in my voice,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because when you have impacts
on you throughout your life,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
they lodge themselves
in your nervous system.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was so shocking
and horrifying to

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:90%
my little eight-year-old self.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
magnificent experiences

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
standing in the cathedrals
in different things.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.441 align:middle line:84%
What was one of the most
magnificent experiences

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you had?
-We were in Notre Dame in Paris.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:10%
And I was standing
there looking up

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:10%
at the flying buttresses
and the internal nave,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:10%
and my father was next to me.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:10%
And this is a perfect
picture of who my father is.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, dad, look, because
I could see all the colors

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:90%
flying throughout the ceiling.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear
angels, I could see

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
angels, what I called angels.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
They were light
beams, flying around,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:84%
sitting, hovering around the
people that were there praying.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking up, stretching
my neck like an ostrich,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and my dad said, yeah, whee,
look at that, look at that.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So again, I thought it was
normal, until I turned 16.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And what happened at 16?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, 16 was a really
challenging time.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was probably the
most profound moment

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I've ever had in my life,
and even beats dying

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and going to the other side.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
My father and I would always
go up to a small Presbyterian

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:90%
college every summer.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
It was our time together.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Wooster College.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And high school kids would meet,
and all age grades would meet.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'd siphon
off into our groups

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and we'd hang out for a
week and do fun things.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And so a young girl
and I-- we'd just

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
met about 48 hours
earlier-- we were

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:90%
walking on the main campus.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
We were 16-- I was
16, she was 17.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
We were looking for
guys, of course.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%
What's a college guy look like?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So we began this little
journey, just chit chatting,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:90%
getting to know each other.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
we could barely walk.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It was as if we were walking
in a thigh-high tide.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And we just couldn't move.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And it scared us,
it frightened us.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
We were going up a very
small, grassy incline.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
We locked arms,
we started crying,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and walked up to a
patio, and made our way--

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we really struggled-- made
our way over to a bench

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and sat down.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And she was feeling the
same thing you were feeling.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.715 align:middle line:84%
She was feeling the exact
same thing simultaneously.

00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like something just came
over us and infused itself,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was, within
us and just affected

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:90%
our bodies so physically.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
And we sat down.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we couldn't
move from the waist down.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We could move everything
from our torso and waist

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:90%
and our arms, head and neck.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But we could not move
anything from the waist down.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And we sat there, and could
you imagine two teenage girls

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
sitting side by side in a
public place, crying out loud,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and nobody would stop and ask.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
It was like they
couldn't see us.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was a patio, a lovely
garden patio, so there

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
were people meandering around.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, a wall
about 40 feet away from us

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
very visually, very
physically, cracked,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
had a zigzag crack
in the middle of it.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And angel wings came
out of the side.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's in a movie.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
But it truly happened
to both of us.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And a head of an
eastern Indian man

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:84%
appeared, and he
would smile at us.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we would cry
and get scared and basically

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:90%
freak out, he would frown.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And over on our left
side, a Christian monk

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
appeared in robes, head
bowed, arms in the sleeves.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't see his face.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And up on a building
to our right

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
was an Oriental man
in full regalia.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And we sat through this for
about an hour and a half.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And we were crying and sobbing.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Sheri, I think
I'm going to throw up.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And she was already bent over.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And my throat was salivating,
and it was opening wide

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:90%
like I'd never felt before.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I was
up next to the Oriental man

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
looking into these
incredible eyes.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I turned, and there
I was looking at Sheri

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and I sitting there,
bent over, gagging.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And within an instant I
was down back in my body,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said to Sheri, I
said, Sheri, we must be

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
having a religious experience.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we've got
to find my father.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So shortly after that,
our bodies let go.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:90%
And other things happened.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:90%
We saw other things.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Plants were illuminated
from within as we

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:90%
walked toward the highway.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Was it more illuminated than
what you had been able to see

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:90%
up to that time in your life?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.761 align:middle line:84%
Was it a new level
of luminosity?

00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It was.
And there was movement to them.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:90%
They were animated.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to reach
down and touch them

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and play with them,
of course, because I'm

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
still that playful person.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said no,
don't touch them.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing-- and so much

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of the information that
came from that experience

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:90%
has trickled in over the years.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it
all floods in, which

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I know frustrates
people when they have

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
deep, profound experiences.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.384 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
everything right now.

00:10:31.384 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Just doesn't happen that way.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Was it more the opening of
a gateway for communication

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:90%
that happened that day?

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And it answered
questions for me.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I was very curious as a
child, and I went to my father

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
when I was 10 and said,
dad, who's right about God?

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we lived
in a small town,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was a Methodist,
a Presbyterian, a Second

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Presbyterian, and a
First Presbyterian church

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
all within 40 yards
of each other.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Catholic church was
right down the street, too.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%
So who's right?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started going
to all these churches.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And my father wisely said,
God is in here, in your heart.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to check
it out for myself.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
So I had Jehovah Witness in.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I had Latter Day Saints in.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Drove the babysitter nuts.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And I just was exploring.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I did that from 10 years
all the way through 16.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
When you say you had them
in, what does that mean?

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I had them in the living room.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
what they knew, and I wanted
to see if that fit for me,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and if they really
knew who God was.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Interrogated them,
which was the beginning

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
of showing your
really pragmatic side,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:90%
which you are very pragmatic.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
from that, then?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
From that experience,
that's when I both blew open

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and shut down almost
simultaneously,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
because by the time we
told everybody about this,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:90%
they had the normal responses.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Like the girls at Fatima.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with this?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with these girls?

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And people believed us, and
some people didn't believe us.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I actually had people
that were mad at me

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
because they had been
praying for so long.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And how could this young
girl, these two young girls,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:90%
have this experience?

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And I've been devoted.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:90%
So that was really interesting.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.323 align:middle line:90%
So you can understand that.

00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So you both opened and
closed at the same time.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Then what about the
near death experience?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Then what happened?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, that really
opened me back up.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And there's no turning back.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it was
like the Cowardly Lion

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:90%
on "The Wizard of Oz."

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I do believe, I do believe.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just haven't
shut down since.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.161 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've just
said, bring it.

00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
die, first of all?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:90%
How did I die?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That was a really
uncomfortable thing.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I developed brain abscesses
in the right occipital lobe

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and spinal meningitis.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know what it was.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They thought I was
pregnant or I had

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:90%
the flu and a sinus infection.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And this was early 1980s, and
in the hospital in my hometown,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
a CAT scan then.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So I saw my light, my colors,
my soul lifting off of my body,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
and I knew I was dying.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:90%
There was no two ways about it.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
The pain was
absolutely horrific.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Indescribable levels
of pain in my head.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
My eyes, at the final point,
were protruding so far

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
from their sockets that
when my eyes were closed,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
my eyes were bugging
from their sockets,

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:90%
the pressure was so high.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And I evidently woke up
in the middle of the night

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital screaming for
the nurse that I was blind,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember any of that.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at the
medical records

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and taken an accounts
from a nurse friend

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and my mother and family.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:90%
So where were you?

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Well after I decided
I was going to let

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:84%
go of the scene
in the ambulance,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
because I saw my mom, and
I saw this young woman,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know who she was.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the nurse said,
hang on, Laura, don't go.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And oh, that's me.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
want any more of this.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I went up into what we know
is the light and the tunnel.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were beautiful
souls coming with me

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
that were on their own journey.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Some were zipping right along
and some were not so fast.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I fell-- because
that's what it felt like to me--

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
it's like my consciousness
fell, and I still had

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
attachment to my physical body.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And it just feels like I was
shot up through a catapult,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
and then dropped down suddenly.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was all light, and it was
buoyant and gorgeous and peace.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And the word love
pales in comparison

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
to the depth of experience that
you have when you cross over.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.074 align:middle line:84%
And everybody feels this,
everybody feels this.

00:14:56.074 --> 00:14:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, everyone I've talked
to that's had this experience

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
feels that.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:90%
They feel it.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it is true, and it is
the reflection of who we are.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So when people say
today, love and light,

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I ask not to say that
casually, because it

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is such a strong,
powerful statement

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to say love and
light to somebody,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
because you are
recognizing them.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like the namaste principle.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You are recognizing
that light in them.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So you shouldn't ever
take that casually.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So now you go over
there, and you're bathed

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:90%
in this experience of love.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And where you shown things?

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.525 align:middle line:84%
Were you being downloaded
with information

00:15:36.525 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:90%
from, perhaps, the future?

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did have that.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I saw my own life
in the past, and I

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:90%
saw my life in the future.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken into
lovely, sacred places,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
forests and a temple.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where I saw the
books, as people talk about.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And you know, this is 1980.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm 26 years old.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm in college studying
to be an architect.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm way over there
on the left brain

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
looking at load-bearing walls
and space frame architecture.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.196 align:middle line:90%
This isn't your thing.

00:16:06.196 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:90%
This is so not my cup of tea.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to run as far away
from all that love and light

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
after the three dudes
showed up when I was 16.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So I went all the way
over to the left side

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:90%
of the hemisphere.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm experiencing this, and
it is the truth of who we are.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It is the legacy of our souls.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And we get the privilege to
be embodied in these forms,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and let that light
shine through us

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and that wisdom
shine through us,

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
even if we get in our own way.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Was it kind of like
the first experience

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that opened up a portal
or portway for access

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to you, to be able to
give you information

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and flow information through
you, or allow you to access?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Did this deepen that?

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And it did so without
as much fear or concern

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
as I had not only growing
up, but especially

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
after that 16-year-old
experience,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
because I was very
concerned about what

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
other people thought about me.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I come out of the
near death experience,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and I had miraculous
things happen to me.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I try to go back to
my life as a mother of a two-

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
and a three-year-old, and a
wife, and a college student.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing all
those colors again.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I had successfully shut
them down for nine years.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
So now you're in it.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:90%
You're committed.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:90%
You can't shut it down anymore.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Now let's do a fast forward
to the point where you decide

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
you're done with
being self-conscious

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're now starting
to employ it, and even

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:90%
bring it into your work.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
How did you initially begin
bringing it into the work?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go into what
you're doing with it now.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It actually found me.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
When I first started seeing
the lights and the colors

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.835 align:middle line:84%
and everything again, and being
able to look through a rock,

00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or look through a house
and a wall in a house,

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I was terrified that I was
getting sick again, because it

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
was right after my
near death experience

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.355 align:middle line:90%
and 10 hours of brain surgery.

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You tend to wonder what else
got messed up there, OK?

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So I ran back to
my neurosurgeon,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was the one who said I
was seeing corillian fields.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, excuse me?

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know
anything about it.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So he led me on the
path that it was OK.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
If somebody like that,
who saved my life,

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
who's a brilliant neurosurgeon,
can say that about me,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:90%
it's like OK.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I can handle this.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And work found me, as
it finds all of us,

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
especially the intuitives
that I've trained.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:90%
People come to them.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:90%
They tell them their problems.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The grocery store
clerk will tell them

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that they had a fight
with their husband

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:90%
or their spouse or whomever.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
People just share.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So how did you get to the
point where you developed

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to an extent where you
became known as this person

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
with x-ray vision?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, that began when
I started working

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:90%
with clients, and then doctors.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
I would speak with doctors.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that relationship,

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to think
that the field of medicine

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
is very closed-minded,
but not everyone is.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.049 align:middle line:84%
-So let's talk about that.
-Yes.

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Very fortunate to live
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Gladys
Taylor McGarry, who

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.215 align:middle line:84%
is the mother of
alternative medicine

00:19:15.215 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and one of the co-founders
for the American Association

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:90%
for Holistic Medicine is there.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And she's 91 now.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And she and other
holistic physicians

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
would gather together.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
So I would go.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to be
a speaker there.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke several
times with Dr.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Gladys and other
holistic physicians

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
on research panels and boards.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Did they use you for diagnosis?

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that seems to be
really difficult part for a lot

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
of doctors, is they simply
don't have the technology

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:90%
to diagnose most of it.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I use the word assessment
because I'm not a physician.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But one of the physicians
from that group

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
called me the next
day and said, I have

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:90%
a patient with breast cancer.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me about her?

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So I sat in my desk
chair, and he was in his,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
you know, across town.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's over here,
it's here, it's here, it's here,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's this size and shape
and this scale and this depth.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And the aggressiveness
is at this speed

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:90%
over on this quadrant.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And I can dissect things.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a 360 degree holographic.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You can see it down
to a cellular level.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:26.556 align:middle line:84%
Yes, virus and bacterias,
which is electromagnetic.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, not electromagnetic,
excuse me.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Electron microscope.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I was tracking
that with him.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And we hung up from
our conversation.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And he called me
a few days later

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and said the MRI came back,
and every place it was--

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It was exactly right.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So now at this point you
can't run away from it,

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:90%
because these skills are needed.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So did you offer your skills
up readily from that point

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
forward?
-I did.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I was open to it.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a natural
marketer with this work.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
People find me.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been very fortunate that
all my work has been word

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of mouth throughout the world.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I serve groups of clients and
85, 90 countries right now.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And it started-- it's
all been word of mouth.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We have the internet
today, and I'm a published

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
author, so I do have a website.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:90%
But I just-- I just, who I am.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
This is who I am, this
is what I am here to do.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:90%
There are no two ways about it.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that I have
that knowing about myself.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:10%
So with that knowing,
the door's always open.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:10%
It just won't shut.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Now how did you come into
an alliance with Dr. Oz?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, I knew a woman that
was on his integrative team.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:10%
And she and I got
in a conversation.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And we worked out an arrangement
where I would go in and teach

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:10%
his integrative medical team.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And this team is a group of
acupuncturists and massage

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
therapists who come in after
post op and offer massages

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
to the cardiac patients
at Columbia Presbyterian.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They do a beautiful,
job beautiful service.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we got the idea
that there could perhaps

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
be more effective if I trained
them in energy medicine

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
techniques and helped them
develop their intuition

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
a little bit better
so they could

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
really be in a sensory
position with their patient.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
them for three years.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And remarkable, remarkable
group of people.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And even though I teach
intuition and energy medicine

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and things like, that it really
is about raising consciousness.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It always comes back to that.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.931 align:middle line:84%
Do most people have the ability
to learn the kind of skills

00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:90%
that you have?

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
If not to the perhaps degree
or depth that you have them,

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
do most people have this ability
innately wired into them?

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that I learned

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
on the other side in my
near death experience,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of my work,
to help remind everybody that we

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:90%
are all hardwired this way.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And we all have different
levels of capacity.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And then our abilities can work
up to whatever our capacity is.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Then let's talk about-- this
is a little more technical.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
get into this part

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.715 align:middle line:84%
now, because we'll take
a break in a little bit,

00:23:13.715 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and when we come
back I want to talk

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
about some very interesting
phenomena you've seen.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the seven stages

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:90%
of opening your intuition.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Through my observation
of myself and clients

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
throughout the years, and
really throughout my whole life,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I've observed that there
are seven primary stages

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that help
us develop our intuition

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and our intuitive perception.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And the first one is instinct.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:90%
We're all driven by that.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And instinct is driven by fear.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only way it
knows how to get our attention.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
It's quick, it's fast,
and it's fear-based, like,

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
don't go down that alley, or
get over to the side of the road

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And we react without thinking.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what intuition
is, defined by Webster,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
is an insight that comes to you
without any kind of reasoning.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it's also a
vehicle that allows us to scan

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and look and sense and feel
and touch base with anything

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:90%
during any time and space.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no limitation on it.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It is our unlimited mind.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's more than just
a flash in the pan thought.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
It is a vehicle.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It's giving information
from the larger

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:90%
part of your vehicle.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And so instinct, when people
are driving around living

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
their life in instinct,
they are pretty much,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
let me go get it, let me go
kill it, let me go stab it,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:84%
let me go do this to it, you
know, it's mine, mine, mine.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
That's instinctual
levels of behavior.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And intuition comes
to people in instinct,

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.451 align:middle line:84%
but it's not very
refined at all.

00:24:48.451 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Level two.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Level two is raw
empathy, and this

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
is where I see so many
women getting stuck, and men

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
too, but primarily women.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Raw empathy, as I define it,
is the ability to feel energy.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And you feel it coming
at you all the time,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
the direction of it,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
where it came from.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It just overwhelms you.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you ride this emotional
roller coaster that can

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:90%
take you all over the place.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And you don't move very well.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:90%
You freeze.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:90%
You freeze.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:84%
The next one up from that, third
level, is directional empathy.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You're still an empath,
you still feel everything.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And instinct and raw empathy
are there working, too,

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that you don't lose
those as you refine

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and go up the ladder here.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So directional empathy is,
you know who said what or felt

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that, or you know who was angry
in the room when you come in

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel
the juice, you know?

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So that you understand
the direction

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and the speed and location
and things like that.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can identify
it a little more.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
-Absolutely.
-OK.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Number four.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Number four is multi-sensory.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
most intuitives,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
professional intuitives
or psychics live.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
They see, feel,
hear, know, perceive.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They're still working on all
those other levels underneath.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:90%
But they get clearer snapshots.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's emotion over
there in your liver.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:90%
The colors are green.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a disk over
there energetically.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And looks like something,
maybe, with a male energy.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.321 align:middle line:84%
So common level of
psychic phenomena.

00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Number five.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Number five is direct
thought transference.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The rudimentary level of
that is when you finish

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:90%
everybody's sentences, OK?

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:90%
We've all been there.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the next level that's
higher up within that station

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
is being able to communicate
with spirit, spirit guides,

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
angels, deceased loved
ones, or anything

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
else, trees, rocks, plants,
buildings, anything else.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the thoughts.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's more auditory level.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Beyond the physical realm.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Beyond the physical realm.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So number six.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.455 align:middle line:84%
Number six is my
favorite place.

00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It's where I live.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:90%
It's called intuitive analytics.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's the place where you
merge intellect and intuition.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
define structures.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:90%
So I use this place.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this place all the
time, whether I'm assessing

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.386 align:middle line:84%
a building that has
got a big crack in it

00:26:58.386 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and the engineers can't find it,
or a physician can't find out

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with the body.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:90%
So the intellect's still there.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And before we take a break,
tell us what the number one--

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
-Integral.
-Number seven is integral.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're
always connected

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:90%
and everything is seamless.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a place very
many people that are walking

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:90%
in bodies live very often.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to come
back and talk about how

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
we use that in just a moment.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.412 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:90%
We are back.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want to back up a
little bit to level two

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:90%
that you were talking about.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But first, give us just
kind of a little overall,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
now that you've told
us these seven levels,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.579 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go back to two.
-OK.

00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure as people listen,
they can identify where they

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
get caught, and where
they can function,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
where their intuition
is coming in clearer.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So that is where they can
start and learn to develop

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:90%
those skills further.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And once you have a ladder, once
you know where you're going,

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:10%
it's a map.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:10%
You can excel
very, very quickly.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:10%
And everybody pops up
to those higher levels.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:10%
It's sustaining them where
I want people to get,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:10%
because I want people
up at their capacity,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:10%
not simply working
at an ability.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in whatever
capacity that is.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever level is your
level that you're working

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%
on at this particular time.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about
level two and level one,

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.650 align:middle line:84%
how fear motivates
people and it helps

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
us discern what's
going on around us,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and we need that
for our survival.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But when you start moving
beyond that basic level, fear,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is the one thing
that totally inhibits and shuts

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:90%
down intuitive capacity.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
the juxtaposition

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
of those two things?

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, fear is very
essential, as you said,

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.690 align:middle line:90%
because it does help us survive.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But the point of release
happens if you take the time

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and look at what
happened after you've

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:90%
passed through the episode.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you take the time to
do that, that's when you can,

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:84%
one, not only release the
fear, but two, get the lesson.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And the lesson is
always delivered

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:90%
through your intuition.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I notice is,
our societies are really--

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Western world, I think
the whole world right now

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:90%
is really rigged toward fear.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
All the impulse, the media,
the information coming in,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:90%
is all fear-driven.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's by design
or not is irrelevant.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:84%
The point is it's keeping people
held in these patterns of fear.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
access your intuition

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
when you're feeling this
overwhelming chemical

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:90%
response of fear.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So the things that help with
that are the intention to wake

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:84%
up, to not be asleep
anymore, to quit

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:84%
biting that poison apple like
Snow White, and falling asleep.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And you do that through a
spiritual practice, whatever

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that is for you, prayer,
meditation, yoga, tai chi,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
qi gong, it doesn't matter,
or an amalgam of those things.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things
that keep you awake.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And we all fall asleep
every now and then.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't all stay awake
every second of our day.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But you you've got to
be able to go, oh, geez,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I fell asleep again on that.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wake up.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you get tractor
beamed into the news

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and the negativity
and the headlines,

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
you've got to just snap
yourself out of it.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
the consciousness of,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I choose to wake
up, the intuition

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:90%
can bulldoze through that fear.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's a nice thing.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a default
that we all have,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
because we are soul first,
and that is that love

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:90%
and that is that light.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that comes through.
-Very good.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you explained that,
because I'm sure there are

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who've
tried, but then they

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
go into either self-judgement,
or some kind of external factor

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
will create fear in their
aura, and then find that I

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:90%
can't go up into those levels.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to move on
to some of the things you

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and I talked about off camera.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're just kind of
throwing spaghetti at the wall

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
right now in that there
are so many things

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
to talk to Laura about.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
One of them I found fascinating
is your perceptions when you're

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:84%
looking at people's
question, where

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.669 align:middle line:84%
am I supposed to be right now?
-Yes.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big one.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people want to
know, what's my purpose?

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Because they feel the pressure.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Where should I be?
What's safe?

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Where should I live?

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.781 align:middle line:84%
Talk about your
response to that.

00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very different.
-Yes.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful.
All my work as remote.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I do all my work over the phone
or via Skype on the computer.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just in my
happy little puppy place

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:90%
looking at things.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And people always ask
me, where should I live?

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy here.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Or am I happy here?

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do is I
look at their bones.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Bones are crystalline
in structure.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:84%
They're carbon-based,
and so is the planet.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And so if there is a cohesive
resonance with the bones

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of the human being, of
the client, of my person,

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:90%
this is a good place for them.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
If not, it'll radiate out
in all kinds of wacky ways.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.581 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it looks as
chaotic as Jiffy Pop popcorn.

00:32:04.581 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Really?
I mean, just static popping out?

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Static popping out.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Especially people are
trying to be somewhere

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and they shouldn't be there.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's a location or a
job or a relationship,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.860 align:middle line:90%
it's all the same.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But what's particularly
interesting

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
is where people are
comfortable on the planet.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a whole
science about geomancy

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and astrocartography.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And those are not
my specialties.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
My specialty is paying
attention to the way

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in which energy resonates,
and if it's consistent or not.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what people
can do for themselves.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all
heard the saying,

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
does it feel right
in your bones?

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's very literal.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so if you feel
comfortable in a place,

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:90%
you'll feel it in your bones.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll feel good.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.911 align:middle line:84%
That must extend to your
nervous system in general,

00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%
then, right?
-Of course.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So it would have to do
with sleeping patterns?

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Sleeping patterns
are affected by this.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Circadian rhythms, rhythm of
the heart, the physical heart,

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
because in the electricity
that beats our hearts

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:90%
generates electromagnetics.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything electric does.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it is in that
electromagnetic pulsation

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that I can find their soul,
that I see the light of who they

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
really are, their
gifts, their talents,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
their propensities, their belief
systems, it doesn't matter.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
From soul to personality,
it's all there.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The writing's on the wall
through that electromagnetic

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:90%
field in the heart.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So if their bones
are not resonating,

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I go into the heart.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And I look at who
they are, not only has

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:84%
a personality and a human
being and what they've

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:90%
been through, but as that soul.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I look on the planet
and see, where do you belong?

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Where do you feel good?
-Oh, really?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Then the image of the
geographical region

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:90%
flows in with it.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So I can target
regions down to cities.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:90%
I find it so fascinating.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Now from their point of
view, you're saying, well,

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you what I'm
seeing in your bones,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
what do people feel like when
they're in the wrong place,

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:84%
in their own bodies physically?
-Right.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned this earlier,
sleeping patterns are off.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.389 align:middle line:84%
It really affects the
amygdala in the brain,

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the early warning signal
that is fear-based,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.625 align:middle line:90%
instinctually based.

00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's a snake in the room.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.350 align:middle line:90%
The amygdala will tell you.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
more edgy and maybe prone

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.429 align:middle line:84%
toward fearful
thoughts and feelings.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Fearful thoughts.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You become an expert at
going to worst case scenario.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
You digestive system
gets really off.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation tends to rise
in the body, which causes

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of problems in any
area that it tends to pocket,

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a joint
or around an organ

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:90%
system or muscle attachments.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
system that gets thrown off

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:90%
is the nervous system.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:90%
So what about lay lines?

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does this have
to literally to do

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:90%
with the lay lines of the land?

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Certain lay lines are just
negative for everyone, or just

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:90%
certain people?

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, my observation is
that it does have something

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:90%
to do with the lay lines.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:84%
But it also has to do, I think
more soulfully, with where you

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:84%
really need to be
to do your work

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and to be fully who you
are, because if we're

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong place, we're
fighting all kinds of things

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, energetically,
and physically.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And who has time to be
who they are if they're

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
fighting on those levels?
You can't.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:90%
You can't fully be present.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't fully
be present, or at least

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:84%
try a little bit,
you're not going

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to hear your intuition, because
it's in that presence where

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.110 align:middle line:90%
it comes through.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody has you,
and has your abilities.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So can a person, for
example, if they've

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:84%
learned to do some basic
dowsing techniques, for example,

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and they've learned to be
quiet and still within-- maybe

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:84%
they're at level
three or level four

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in those stages of
developing perception.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Can a person fairly
reasonably expect

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to find the place in the
world, get a map out,

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:90%
get your dowsing tools out?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, don't be
afraid of the answer,

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because when you're not
up at intuitive analytics,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
you tend to talk
yourself out of it

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:84%
pretty darn quickly,
as quickly as

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
the information that came in.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Now intuition always
comes in that sweet,

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:90%
quiet, gentle, neutral voice.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no emotion attached
to an intuitive thought.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:84%
However, it can provoke
emotion very quickly.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.650 align:middle line:90%
So you have to watch yourself.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You have to be that observer.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I had my astrocartography
done one time.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.900 align:middle line:90%
I was single woman at the time.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
this is interesting.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought, gee, I wonder
where my Venus lines go?

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:84%
When I saw them run through
Tasmania, I was very upset.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, I don't
have a snowball's

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:84%
chance in you know where
of finding a relationship

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:90%
that'll work.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.891 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, maybe astrocartography
isn't necessarily the best way

00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:45.561 align:middle line:84%
to go on that.
-It's not.

00:36:45.561 --> 00:36:46.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to be fluid
with who you are.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mind when-- I don't
teach this, but a lot of people

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:84%
use all kinds of tools
to divine information.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's fine
when you're starting out.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
If you can put your trust
in something like that,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.190 align:middle line:84%
You have to make
your own track record.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.327 align:middle line:84%
You have to really play with
it and try it in that very calm

00:37:10.327 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
place until you start
seeing that you're getting

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.087 align:middle line:90%
some kind of credible results.

00:37:14.087 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to put
that out there for anyone

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:90%
who's thinking, oh my god.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:90%
My bones don't feel good here.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:90%
How do I have control over that?

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's right.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid of the answer,
even if it is Tasmania.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
on the other side.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to
make assumptions, either.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
the Venus line is
where you'd find love.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to make
that kind of assumption.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:84%
-You can tell I was a neophyte.
-I know.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We've all been newbies.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.052 align:middle line:90%
I was too.

00:37:38.052 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Now there's something
else we talked about

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and I alluded to a moment ago.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back for a moment.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I know we're kind of jumping
back and forth a tad here.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But this level two, and first
of all the level one and fear,

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and then going to
that second level.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I spoke off camera
about what happens there,

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned
the word freeze.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And this happens
in a lot of people.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, we already spoke
of fear and what that's

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
doing to our aura, what it's
doing to our nervous system,

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:84%
our digestive systems,
how it's shutting

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:90%
down our own intuition.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the kind of
freezing you're speaking of.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It happens naturally
in the nervous system

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:90%
when we focus on things.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:84%
It's in the prefrontal and
frontal cortex of the brain.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the pause and focus
button is what I call it.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.904 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
threading a needle,

00:38:28.904 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:84%
there's no way you're
going to be able to do

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:90%
a tap dance at the same time.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't move other
parts of your body.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all been
in the computer trance,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
where we are so mentally
focused on doing

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.400 align:middle line:84%
something on our computer
we don't move our bodies.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And we oftentimes
forget we have them.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in that
raw empathy place,

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling everything and
you start hyper focusing on,

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:84%
what was that?
What was that?

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel terrible.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm getting a
pain in my back.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my heart's racing.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
You start tracking
through your body

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:90%
feeling all these sensations.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And you slide into that hyper
focus, and that freezes you.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Hyper focus is a good word.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Hypervigilant, that
might be another word.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And you are not exempt, even
though you're hanging out

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:84%
in that sixth level for most of
your time, your waking hours,

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
when you go into really
difficult cases, you told me,

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
it can have such
a profound impact

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.090 align:middle line:90%
on you that your being freezes.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Your body freezes.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have spent
many years looking

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:84%
at myself, asking
myself, OK, what

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.760 align:middle line:90%
do you need to do about this?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you need
to do about this?

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a very
physical empath.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I will feel their
nervous system.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I will feel the beat of
their heart in my own heart.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I will feel their lower
back pain in my own back.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, that triggers
all my chemistry.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything in my body
replicates what's

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:84%
going on in them, which doesn't
make it real easy at times.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned how to
mitigate it pretty much.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The exciting thing is, I've
come on to some new territory

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
within myself that I'm working
with other people on, too,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and it gets you out of
freeze mode more quickly.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And-- you can tell I'm
getting excited about it.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:90%
I know, I can't wait.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very personal
to so many healers.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:90%
A lot of healers put on weight.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I can work with a
severe cancer person,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.030 align:middle line:84%
whether they're in
person or over the phone,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and I could put on three
pounds in an hour and a half.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.797 align:middle line:84%
My body weighs three pounds
more without drinking any water.

00:40:27.797 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can only
describe it as energetic.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And energy has structure,
and we are energy.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And when my nervous system is
feeling what they're feeling,

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm releasing cortisol, I'm
releasing all this stuff.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And we know what cortisol does.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.540 align:middle line:90%
It builds fat in the body.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've done a lot of research
over the last few years,

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:84%
particularly because I said,
OK, enough, enough, enough.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I am an empath.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I've had enough of this.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I used to be very
svelte and thin.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But this is true.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of the women I
know, and men I know,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:84%
who are really good
clairvoyants or psychics,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.271 align:middle line:84%
clairaudient
intuitives, are heavy.

00:41:11.271 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I have found a
way, in a body mind spirit way,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to work with the nervous
system, to work with food,

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to work with energy
most particularly,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual practice.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've only been
into my own formula

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
for about a month and a half,
and already have had success.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've been working
with other people,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
great success.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't have to be a
working intuitive to do this.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people are
empathic, and in varying

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.740 align:middle line:84%
degrees, struggling with this.
-Right.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever watched shows
that focus on weight loss,

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.840 align:middle line:84%
you can see how emotionally
sensitive these people are.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And they hide behind food
and emotional eating.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:84%
-This is really a big one.
-It's huge.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.651 align:middle line:84%
No pun intended, and
no sarcasm intended.

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:01.350 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It's enormous, because this
is such a painful thing

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:90%
for so many people.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And the thing for me is that
I would get into freeze mode,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:90%
and I would have to just sit.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I tell my friends and my
family that I'm drooling now.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't bother me, I'm drooling.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would literally
go sit in meditation,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:84%
or sit and look at
a tree or something.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would have to just let my
body rest, and my energy rest,

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:90%
after sessions.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered some new
energetic techniques that I can

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:84%
do really quickly
right after session,

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and physical techniques that
I can do right after session,

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that knocks me out of having
to sit in my drool phase,

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:90%
as I call it.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because following
the drool phase

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.036 align:middle line:84%
is drooling over some
carbohydrate phase.

00:42:48.036 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It can.
It can.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because food is
something that grounds us.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin
production with cards,

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
which people are trying to get.
-Yeah.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And as any intuitive
knows, professional or not,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.150 align:middle line:84%
especially professionals,
if you've been drilling in

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:84%
for several hours,
it is like doing nine

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:90%
or 10 hours of mental work.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It really is an escalated pace.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and there's a
self-perpetuating cycle, too.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you get in that, where
you're in your drool phase--

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:90%
the same thing happens to me.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.310 align:middle line:84%
When I become overwhelmed,
or just work really hard,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just burning
through a lot of fat

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
in the brain or whatnot,
I do the same thing.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And I've always wondered.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll just sit there
in a vegetative state

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.730 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit.
Can't move.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Don't even take my shoes off.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Just plop down with my coat
and shoes on and can't move.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
often enough, you

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:84%
get into this
self-perpetuating cycle

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
where you don't want
to move because you're

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.330 align:middle line:84%
stuck in this
hypervigilant mental state.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then exercise just
kind of goes away.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens with
a lot of people, doesn't it?

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.170 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of men and
women, whether you're

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
overweight or not, we're being
we're so trying to survive,

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:84%
we can't break out of
it to move anymore.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And this goes well beyond
people sitting in cubicles

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:90%
or sitting at desks.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.260 align:middle line:90%
This is well beyond that.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:84%
This is an energetic and a very
physical thing that happens

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:90%
that puts weight on people.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Louise Hay, in her book
"You Can Heal Your Life,"

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
noted years ago that
weight is protection.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And you bet your bottom dollar
that an intuitive, especially

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.200 align:middle line:84%
like myself, or anybody
else, a healer who

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.430 align:middle line:84%
merges with diseases, it's like,
the body's pretty darn smart,

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.900 align:middle line:84%
even though my head says, you
know, I'm like Mighty Mouse.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I can go in there
and do anything,

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.920 align:middle line:84%
but my body's going,
oh lord, incoming.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So it buffers itself.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:84%
My nervous system responds
even though my mind

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is calm and clear and
like a placid lake.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
The body has its own
survival mechanism.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And you are writing a
book about this right

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.980 align:middle line:84%
now, because it's looking like
the evidence is coming in.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:84%
You've broken this
code about holding

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:84%
this weight on through these
fear and freeze patterns.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Not fear, freeze patterns
that happen of overwhelm.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be huge.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
about it for all of us.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And now let's talk about
some of the other things

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing with people--
you have a lot of clients--

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the increase,
even in the last five years

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:84%
since I saw you last,
in certain spectrums

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.400 align:middle line:84%
of dysfunction or disease
that's going on right now.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:90%
What are you seeing as a shift?

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:84%
The biggest shift is
actually sleeping patterns

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.360 align:middle line:90%
and nervous system issues.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.490 align:middle line:84%
With the ramping up of
technology, the ramping

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.860 align:middle line:84%
up of consciousness as we
move into this new phase

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, the overload and
stress, the financial stress

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is feeling, it
affects the nervous system,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:84%
which affects sleep, eating
patterns, every single thing,

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.000 align:middle line:90%
all the hormones in the body.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.830 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's really
unfortunately huge is diabetes.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to
ask you about that.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that dovetails
into what I just

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
said about what people are
having to go through to live

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.360 align:middle line:90%
a decent life right now.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.860 align:middle line:90%
People want it sweeter.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is as simple
as that, diabetes,

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:06.990 align:middle line:84%
from an energy
medicine point of view

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and an emotional intelligence.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I just want things
to be sweeter.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So they can't help
when their stressed,

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
because the brain doesn't
know the difference

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:90%
between chocolate and sex.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.160 align:middle line:84%
They're the same
chemical response.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And since sex may not be
available with a partner that's

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.700 align:middle line:84%
legitimate, let's
go to the Hershey

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.711 align:middle line:84%
Bar or something, or a
frappuccino mocha whatever

00:46:29.711 --> 00:46:30.410 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about an increase

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.470 align:middle line:90%
in adult onset diabetes.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Even from 20-year-olds
on, though, it's rampant.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are 79
million, according

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.140 align:middle line:84%
to the latest statistics,
that are undiagnosed.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And so I see a lot of that.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:84%
When I go into somebody's
body-- I am so privileged to do

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
this work, because
a lot of people

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.530 align:middle line:84%
are concerned about their
weight and their health,

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.340 align:middle line:84%
obviously, they come to a
medical intuitive like myself.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So I dive into a cell structure,
particularly a fat cell,

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and I look at the
emotional intelligence

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and the chemical intelligence
that's going on there.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And the levels of
resistance-- we

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.890 align:middle line:84%
talk about insulin resistance
from a medical point of view,

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but the emotional resistance
and the chemical resistance

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in their
bodies is just as profound.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And they are locked
in there like a fort.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
any emotion in,

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.860 align:middle line:90%
they don't want any emotion out.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real
Catch-22 for them,

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.660 align:middle line:90%
because they want to be happy.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.470 align:middle line:84%
They want their
life to be easier.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But their cells are locked
in a pattern of nope,

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:90%
it's not safe out there.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's getting in, and I'm
not letting any of these toxins

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.340 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.104 align:middle line:90%
So it takes some time.

00:47:38.104 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:90%
So you're like in a fort.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:84%
You're in a holding
pattern for survival.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You said 79 million
are undiagnosed?

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Undiagnosed.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Globally or?

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
In the United States alone.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.780 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is an
assumption by the American

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes Association.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.280 align:middle line:90%
A quarter of the population.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But you start looking into
those who are already diagnosed,

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that's more than a
third of the population.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, you look at
the food sources.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.490 align:middle line:84%
You look at the things
that are addictive.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, modern food is as
addictive as narcotics.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so part of this book is a
philosophy that I truly believe

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.890 align:middle line:90%
in, and it's very simple.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:84%
If you can pick it, peel
it, or catch it, eat it.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.760 align:middle line:90%
If you can't, don't eat it.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:84%
-That's good.
-Very simple.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.809 align:middle line:84%
That's very simple.
OK.

00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about cancer.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing in terms
of the types of cancers you're

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.340 align:middle line:84%
seeing increases in and the root
cause, if you're going to look

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:84%
at it from a full perspective?
-Yeah.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, from the
macro point of view,

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is about anger and deep
levels of frustration,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:84%
rage, and varying
levels, depending on what

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:90%
the person has gone through.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it usually takes a long
time to perpetuate that level

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.140 align:middle line:90%
of anger in the body.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And it can be from something
that was done to you, not

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.490 align:middle line:84%
necessarily that you
personally made a mistake

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:90%
and you're mad at yourself.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:90%
But cancer is a mighty foe.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.970 align:middle line:90%
It has a huge morphic field.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
morphic field when

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.070 align:middle line:90%
it generates a consciousness.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that has anything
to do with cancer, whether it's

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.070 align:middle line:84%
researchers or physicians,
hospitals, and patients,

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:84%
they're all the
morphic field together.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So colon cancer is
definitely on the rise.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Stomach cancer,
pancreatic cancer.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Pancreatic cancer, yes.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Pancreatic, in my
line of work, anyway.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:90%
That used to be very rare.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.550 align:middle line:90%
It used to be very rare.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
people are really

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:84%
upset about how
hard life has gotten

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:90%
in the last 20 to 25 years.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Our parents are the greatest
generation, as they're called.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And we grew up expecting
that, and it's not that easy.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And our kids are-- a lot
of kids are going home.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.890 align:middle line:84%
College graduates
don't have jobs.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's tougher out there.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So people are upset that life
is not as happy or as easy

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.010 align:middle line:90%
as they'd like it.

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, now we look back.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about
cancer and the rising cancer

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.360 align:middle line:84%
statistics, a lot
of times people

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.860 align:middle line:84%
will say, well,
that's just because we

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.530 align:middle line:90%
have better diagnostics.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.320 align:middle line:90%
But that cannot be true.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.780 align:middle line:90%
We rarely knew anyone.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I know growing up,
it was very rare you

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.390 align:middle line:84%
ever heard of someone that had
cancer or died from cancer.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Could have been called
something different at the time,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.280 align:middle line:90%
consumption, I don't know.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We're having huge rises
in actual incidence

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.450 align:middle line:84%
of cancer of all kinds.
-Right.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really have a problem
with the food industry

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and highly processed
food and sugar.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Sugar is not anybody's
friend at all,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.320 align:middle line:84%
because I see those molecules
go through somebody's

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.820 align:middle line:84%
intestinal tract,
and they literally

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.510 align:middle line:90%
are like shards of glass.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And they cause irritation and
inflammation with everything

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.800 align:middle line:90%
that they touch.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they ramp up
in your bloodstream.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.380 align:middle line:90%
They fire up your brain.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They spike your nervous system,
release all kinds of chemicals,

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and then the body has
to dial that down.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the immune
system has to jump on board,

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.530 align:middle line:84%
release white blood cells,
and try and clean up the mess.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So it perpetuates everything.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the body gets
addicted to the carbohydrate

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or the sugar or the flour,
and then the brain says,

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.300 align:middle line:90%
I need more, I need more.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
we fall asleep.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And have to wake up.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:24.545 align:middle line:84%
Do see this at the base of
most people that have cancer,

00:51:24.545 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is that there's been this
larger consumption, in general,

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.041 align:middle line:84%
of these carbohydrates,
these simple carbohydrates?

00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But also, in
addition to thatt-- I

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.070 align:middle line:84%
don't want to blame
everything on food,

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly
part of the toxic level

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that keeps toxicity in the body
and keeps the body inflamed.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's the big culprit.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So first of all we're looking
at extreme disappointment,

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
sadness, anger, frustration,
which most people watching this

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.490 align:middle line:90%
can probably relate to.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Life has gotten pretty
tough for most people

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.110 align:middle line:90%
right now on this planet.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.610 align:middle line:84%
There are some people that
are still experiencing joy,

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and things are going
their way, but they're

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:04.550 align:middle line:84%
not in the majority, at least
not in their own perception.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So now say they've been
given a cancer diagnosis.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And they've also maybe
been eating poorly, just

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to get enough serotonin
to feel good and get

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:84%
through the
afternoon, maybe have

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.050 align:middle line:84%
a latte with vanilla
in it, and some kind

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of a pastry or whatnot.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you-- and I'm
not asking you to give

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.200 align:middle line:84%
an assessment that
fits all people,

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.490 align:middle line:84%
but where do you tell them to
begin when something like this

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.050 align:middle line:90%
comes into their life?

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.200 align:middle line:84%
FIrst of all, I think it's
important to knock down

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:84%
the fence that separates
alternative and complementary

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.090 align:middle line:84%
medicine from
allopathic medicine.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I have been to too many
funerals with those

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:84%
who've wanted to do
only herbs and qi

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.820 align:middle line:90%
gong-- and qi gong's wonderful.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Qi gong has saved
many, many people.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
don't do qi gong.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:53.030 align:middle line:90%
In fact, do it.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:54.030 align:middle line:90%
As a complement.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
As a complement.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons it's called
complementary and integrative

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.780 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And integrative
medicine are techniques

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that have been studied and
researched and validated

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that they are indeed helpful.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine, homeopathy,
qi gong is one of them.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Tai chi, massage,
hands-on healing, Reiki.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Reiki's in many
hospitals these days.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:90%
All of these things are great.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're not necessarily
going to get you up

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:84%
over the hump when you
have aggressive, angry

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:90%
cells inside of your body.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I go into those cells
with my own consciousness

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and discern, how
are they getting

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:30.140 align:middle line:90%
along in the neighborhood?

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the surrounding cells
in the margin that is clean,

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.280 align:middle line:84%
some of them are ignorant,
ignore-ant, if you will,

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:90%
of the cancer cells.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They're just like, oh,
yeah, we're just doing

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.660 align:middle line:90%
our thing, the little cell.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
know that something

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is raging behind a
barrier, a tissue barrier.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And those cancer cells have
a very strong intellect.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're like,
OK, let's go over here.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over there,
let's go invade over here.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into that lymph node.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's go down the neck and
go into the stomach, guys.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is literally what I
hear when I'm inside of them.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how I
help doctors, patients

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and doctors who work with
me, get the right formula

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:90%
going with herbs.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And the doctors do all that.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't prescribe anything.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I just assess what's going
on and share my findings

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and observations
with a physician,

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.200 align:middle line:90%
and they take it from there.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And in one case recently,
a person with cancer

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.910 align:middle line:90%
was on that holistic fence.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just went, oh, please
don't do this to yourself.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
whatever you want.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to give
you information.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I you gave her
information about a physician

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.910 align:middle line:90%
who is a tremendous MD.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And she's done a turnaround.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't even want
to go to her oncologist.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.124 align:middle line:90%
She was terrified.

00:54:48.124 --> 00:54:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, people are terrified
about oncologists,

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.490 align:middle line:84%
because we know so
many people that die

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:53.550 align:middle line:90%
from the radiation and chemo.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
this nice balance.

00:54:55.490 --> 00:55:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So really, an individual's left
to find somebody that can--

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:84%
well, I mean, obviously,
someone like you can give them

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.570 align:middle line:84%
some guidance and
send them somewhere--

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.640 align:middle line:84%
but be able to balance what
their particular case needs.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that
it needs to be more

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.640 align:middle line:84%
aggressive on the
alternative side

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.640 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't been that
invasive just yet, right?

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And other times maybe targeted,
very aggressive treatment.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But this targeted part is what
our medical industry seems

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to have a difficulty
with, just throwing

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.220 align:middle line:90%
it at the entire immune system.

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.170 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:84%
What does it look
like inside the body

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.450 align:middle line:84%
when you've been through
aggressive radiation and chemo?

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, remember marshmallows
when you were a kid,

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and they get a
little charcoaled?

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:38.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what radiation
looks like to me

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and my intuitive
perception on surrounding

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.240 align:middle line:90%
cells to varying degrees.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.456 align:middle line:90%
To varying degrees, of course.

00:55:45.456 --> 00:55:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing about
some of the chemotherapy drugs

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:51.280 align:middle line:84%
these days, they are
much more targeted.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes clients and physicians
will give me the name the drug.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know where
they go or what they do,

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.280 align:middle line:84%
but I'll report to
them what I'm seeing.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And they say that's right.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll see whether it's
a match for that body.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.249 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Gosh, Laura.

00:56:05.249 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could-- obviously,
every single disease,

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to know what it
looks like from the inside

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.030 align:middle line:84%
on a cellular level
of each one of these.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But I thought we-- in
our first conversation,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.570 align:middle line:84%
because we're definitely going
to have you back here with us--

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:84%
at least talk a
little bit about that,

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
about what it looks like
inside the body with cancer.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are many,
many ways to deal with it.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:10%
And what would you say, when
you can do an assessment,

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.550 align:middle line:10%
and people are brave
enough and trusting enough

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.950 align:middle line:10%
to be able to work with
their holistic doctor

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.530 align:middle line:10%
and use these
integrative modalities,

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:41.260 align:middle line:10%
what kind of success
rates are you seeing?

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.050 align:middle line:10%
I see wonderful success
rates for these people.

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And I don't keep all clear data.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:10%
But you know, seeing
them and hearing

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.070 align:middle line:10%
their voices five and
seven and 10 years

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:55.340 align:middle line:10%
later is pretty incredible.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.700 align:middle line:10%
Lost a dear client
just recently.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And I met her 14 years
ago, and the doctor said

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:03.740 align:middle line:10%
she had six months to live.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.860 align:middle line:10%
So after we worked together,
she just turned herself around.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.760 align:middle line:10%
14 more years out of life.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:10%
So next thing coming
up for you, and I

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.910 align:middle line:10%
want to have you back
when that happens, is

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.390 align:middle line:10%
in another five or
six months, your book

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.490 align:middle line:10%
is going to be coming out on
cracking this code about what

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.390 align:middle line:10%
makes us hold on to weigh.

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that is something we
all have to look forward to.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Any final thought?

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
a minute left.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.635 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, thank you
so much for having me here.

00:57:29.635 --> 00:57:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for what
you're doing, because you're

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.840 align:middle line:84%
bringing such wonderful
information to the listeners

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and to the world.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And we need you right now.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.360 align:middle line:90%
We need you so much right now.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.430 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, Regina.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm truly honored
to do this job.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I love what I do.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So as we just said, you will
not lose touch with Laura.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.194 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have her
back when her book is out.

00:57:49.194 --> 00:57:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, if
you'd like to get

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in touch with her
or her work, you

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.570 align:middle line:90%
can go to energymedicine.org.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I can't stress enough
how important it is now,

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we have to be able to
see beyond the obvious

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.530 align:middle line:90%
into this world of illusion.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's our choice.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.330 align:middle line:90%
