00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting here
from Denver, Colorado.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So what if our psyches
knew everything

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to know--
our past and our future,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:84%
where we're going and
what if the deepest

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:84%
answers to our most
important questions

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:90%
are locked inside of our psyche?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you want to
find out how to get them?

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is past life
regressionist, Mira Kelley, who

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
had a profound healing
experience herself

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:90%
when she was 13 years old.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.011 align:middle line:84%
And she had found herself
into a very powerful past life

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out
more about her experience

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and how she teaches people
to learn about where we're

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
going by looking at our past.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRA KELLEY: Hi, Lisa.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.606 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My goodness,
you have quite a journey

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:90%
that you've been on here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about your
life growing up.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Where did you grow up?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I grew up in Bulgaria.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, Bulgaria
was a communist country.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So growing up for me,
there was no religion.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:90%
There was no talk of God.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And reincarnation was something
I didn't even know of.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so, once communism
tumbled down as a regime,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
there was such hunger in people
for spiritual information,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
for that sense of connecting and
knowing that we are not alone.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was there?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.593 align:middle line:84%
Was there just a deep
yearning for now what?

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
For the bigger sense
of belonging and seeing

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the bigger picture of life.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was in
that environment

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that I got introduced
to past life regression.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very nonjudgmental
environment, right,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
because people
have been deprived

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of information.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So anything was all right.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.677 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All religion.

00:01:58.677 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there any
specific religion that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:90%
became prominent at the time?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Bulgaria traditionally
has been Christian Orthodox,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
so that was there.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously, people were
interested in talking about--

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
so there was a revitalization
of going to church.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.179 align:middle line:84%
But also in the
same conversation

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of going to church,
people would talk

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs and poltergeist and
energy healing and psychics.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.257 align:middle line:84%
And so it was really a very
open and receptive environment.

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So you found your way to a
past life regressionist out

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:90%
of what means?

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So I
came across a book.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And this book was
telling the stories

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
of people simply healing
by having these experiences

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.817 align:middle line:90%
in their minds.

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They would just see
something in their minds

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and that would impact
them by healing traumas

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and physical conditions
and emotional issues.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was really very
intrigued by this.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, I decided
to regress myself.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, imagine at the age
of 13, I was so curious.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking to
myself, you know what?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything
going on with me.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
physical ailments.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I've got nothing.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
But I have curiosity.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was so curious and I
wanted to know for myself,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
so I created a recording
and I regressed myself

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
using a recording.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you learn about it?

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Through the book.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Through the book.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.995 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And the
book was simply

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
giving a script of what you can
do and I took the opportunity.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brilliant.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And imagine, at the
tender age of 13,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
learning about not only
about another lifetime

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but also seeing your
spirit leaving the body

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that there is
a continuation of life

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if I was really
afraid of dying when I was 13.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not the kind
of stuff you think about,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
but it impacted me hugely.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So right then and
there, the fear is gone.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And also, the other thing
that it did for me is it

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
made me realize
what is the bigger

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
lesson I'm here to
learn, you know,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:90%
the bigger purpose of my life.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.824 align:middle line:90%
So that was amazing.

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then you found
yourself in New York City

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
as an attorney.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
How did you get from--

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: [LAUGHS]

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.524 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that curious
13 year old to the US--

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: That is
a good question.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.981 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --as an attorney.

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I came to the US on intuition.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was really that
deep feeling within me of,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:90%
that's just where I need to be.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about your family?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.276 align:middle line:90%
Did they come as well?

00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: They came later.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
They chose to join me later.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell
you, I didn't come

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
for an economic reason--
you know, the reason why

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:90%
most people immigrate.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just simply the awareness
of there's something there.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.635 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad I
followed it, right?

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you went
to school first?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Yeah, so I went to
college and then law school.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And after law school,
I started practicing

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
as a corporate and
securities attorney

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
in a large law firm
in New York City.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's not a short
period of time there.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.864 align:middle line:84%
How long was that,
about 10 years?

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, quite a while.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.601 align:middle line:90%
Much longer than that.

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was really when I was
already working as an attorney

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that I came back into the
world of past life regression.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how did you-- how
did that get you back there?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: You know, it
was a physical condition

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
that brought me there.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I had developed-- out of a
very simple dental procedure--

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I developed an immensely
painful jaw condition.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And for those of our
viewers who don't know,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
TMJ is a condition of
the jaw, of the muscles.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So not in the jaw
itself but just

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
the muscles being inflamed.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, it was so
sever that I couldn't even

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
open my mouth to put a
spoonful of food in my mouth.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It was just that painful.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you can imagine,
after a whole year of trying

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to heal all of this, I
was exhausted emotionally

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and financially and physically.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:90%
It was also so draining.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.576 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your jaw was just
locked up all day, all night?

00:06:18.576 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.781 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No relief.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, my dentist sat me down
one day and he said to me,

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:90%
We have tried everything.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.735 align:middle line:90%
We need to be realistic.

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said-- realistic.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%
What a word to use.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, his version of realistic
was he offered me two things.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
He said that I
either should learn

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to live with chronic pain
for the rest of my life--

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and that sounded
horrible, right?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Or I should have my
jaw broken and then

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:90%
reattached back with wires.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the operation he was
suggesting as my second option.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
That didn't leave you--
those were like no and no.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.039 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did you figure
your way back to regression?

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so, it was really
in that moment of desperation

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and needing something else
that in the back of my mind

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the regression
I did as a little kid, right?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I very quickly
found the practitioner.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I was
reintroduced back to the work.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And so during my
session with this woman,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself as-- I needed
this to work, right?

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.251 align:middle line:84%
That's why this time I was
going to go to practitioner.

00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so, I
saw myself as a slave.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had this big, metal collar
right here around my neck.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And when it was
put together, there

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
was an imperfection that was
always rubbing against my jaw

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
where the main pain spot was as
who I was at that time as Mira.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, as this man, I was very
strong powerfully-- as a man--

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
but I was a slave who
was emotionally broken.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot
of emotion that

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
got released during
the regression for me,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot of cathartic emotion.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you went back into
this memory in your mind?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was so real to you.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
those memories that come up

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
in past life
regression as opposed

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:90%
to maybe if you have a dream?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: The beauty
of it is that when

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
it is an experience that
you're seeking to heal with,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:90%
it really impacts you hugely.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there a difference between
regression and dreams?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily because
sometimes people

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
have profoundly healing
dreams as well, right?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people even
connect with past lives

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
through dreams.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So this was me taking control
and looking for the healing

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in a way, through regression.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So once you
found this character--

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
this man as a slave that have
the collar that was hitting

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the jaw-- what epiphany
did you have and how

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
did you link that
back to your pain?

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I love the question.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was such a cathartic
release of emotions within me

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that I was left with
questions rather than answers.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering,
what does it really

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
mean to be powerful because this
man was powerful physically,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
but emotionally he
was powerless, right?

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was wondering
but, you know,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get to an
answer that afternoon.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So I pretty much cried
for the rest of the day,

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.484 align:middle line:84%
just because of the
emotions being released.

00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Released, yes.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And then here's
the miracle of this story.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.381 align:middle line:84%
The next morning I woke up and
the pain was completely gone.

00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.379 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --just
gone, just like that.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And my dentist--
I didn't actually

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
tell him what I had done
to heal this, right?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.262 align:middle line:84%
Back then I didn't
feel comfortable.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take me into that
moment in the morning

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.899 align:middle line:84%
where you were able to release
your jaw and open your mouth.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: It was extraordinary.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Were you shocked?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.921 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.976 align:middle line:84%
It was an extraordinary feeling
of oh my God, oh my God.

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
wasn't anything you

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.016 align:middle line:90%
were intending or visualizing?

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this is really the
power of past life regression.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I have seen it with
so many people.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's really the simple
experience of going through it

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and not even necessarily
understanding

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:90%
how it all fits and belongs.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It serves.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The memory is awake
and the emotions

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
are released and healed,
and then the body

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:90%
was ready to heal.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.606 align:middle line:84%
So you did go back
to the dentist?

00:10:43.606 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: So I did go back.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.229 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And I didn't
tell him what I had done.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So he just looked at me and
he said, this is a miracle.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
what else to say.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But it was such
a beautiful-- oh,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I should tell you this, too.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So seven years later, I am
going for my regular checkup

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and so he looks at my chart and
he says to me, how's your jaw?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And I say to him, my jaw?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Why are we talking about my jaw?

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me, well,
do you remember everything

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
about your jaw?

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my jaw.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And this time around I
felt very comfortable

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
talking about what I did, right?

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So I told him the story
and he was so moved by it.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that because
of my case being so extreme

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and being so out there, he had
actually opened up a TMJ clinic

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and bought all this
equipment and learned

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:84%
all this information
and done all this study

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.812 align:middle line:90%
because I set him on this path.

00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.353 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so he said to me,
I will be sending you clients.

00:11:54.353 --> 00:11:56.731 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, that is
the completion of a circle,

00:11:56.731 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.728 align:middle line:84%
Because I was thinking, why
would you go back to him?

00:11:59.728 --> 00:12:01.445 align:middle line:84%
What would you-- but
you did it because--

00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: It was.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.379 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've
helped people since then

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to recover lifetimes that
unlocks healing for us?

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So ever since then,
the knowing and awareness

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
of how helpful this
process is for people

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
had been solidified
in me, right?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I know it for myself
like I know it.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
past life regression

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it can help people
with any kind of challenge

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going through--
be it emotional,

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:84%
be it a physical issue,
be it traumas, be

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
it challenges with
our family members,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
issues with wanting to increase
your prosperity, whatever it

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.997 align:middle line:90%
is that we're working through.

00:12:41.997 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now then
you, for some reason,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
attracted or reached
out to Wayne Dyer,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and got his attention and
helped him with a regression.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It was a very
beautiful experience

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
of me reaching out to
him-- again, on intuition.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
That feeling that
I can serve him.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
did not know Wayne,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
nor did I know anybody
who knew Wayne.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And so, I reached out.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
He was very interested
and we worked together.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in his work
with me, it really

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
allowed him to understand
so much more of himself--

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
his soul's path,
the reason why he's

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:90%
so passionate about his work.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It allows him to really heal
physically and emotionally

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.087 align:middle line:90%
in a very profound way.

00:13:29.087 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a video here
where Wayne Dyer

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.452 align:middle line:84%
is talking about Mira
Kelley and the experience

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
that they had together.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.083 align:middle line:84%
>>WAYNE DYER: Why
don't you just share

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about what
you-- your history of it,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.071 align:middle line:84%
how it works and I still
don't quite know myself.

00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I agree
with what you said

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and what Anita says that these
are really simultaneous lives

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that we live, and what you
experienced was not really

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
a past life.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It was just the ability
to suspend the input

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
from your senses from the
taste, touch, smell, all those,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and be actually able to place
your attention on everything

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:90%
that is out there.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it works
when I regress people.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I allow them to go deep within
and to expand their awareness

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:90%
of what is out there.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
people could connect

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to these other lifetimes
they have lived.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
experience becomes

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
such a vivid and
personal experience.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:90%
They feel it in their bodies.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They cry with the
emotions they experience.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And really, by placing
their attention,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:90%
they become these other people.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: How long does it take?

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It could take quite
a few hours because, you know,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
it's a journey through seeing
who you are and what you are.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fast one.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.049 align:middle line:84%
And the depth of it allows
for the quality of it.

00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So most of the time it's
between four and five hours.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So it's a
half a day experience.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:00.593 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.194 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Is it hypnosis?

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: It is.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But because it is so deep, such
a deep experience, to people

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
it feels like it was just a few
minutes because time is really

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
something we create
with our minds.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And once we draw our
attention and awareness,

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we really go into that
place of timelessness.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So people really experience
it as very much time

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:90%
not being there.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And it being a
hypnosis, yes it is.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And hypnosis is such
a natural state.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a state that we
pass several times a day--

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
when we wake up,
when we go to sleep,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
when we are in the movie
theater and we watch a movie

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and we become so
involved and so engrossed

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that we forget about the people
coughing around us and shifting

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
in their seats, or when
we read a great book.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.336 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very natural state.

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: OK.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you, Mira.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:84%
When you did the regression
with me, which took about a half

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
a day, and I reproduced in
the book part of what it was.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And I went back and
became this old man

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
with a long white beard,
white hair, in this cave,

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that this man
whose life overlapped mine

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
literally became a part of me?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't
just Peter Deunov.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the
Swami Yukteswar,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:84%
who I see now all the time,
who I saw in the story

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:90%
that I just told.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I became like a composite
of these great teachers.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of it
feeling that there

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely nothing
that could keep me

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
from fulfilling a
Dharma, that I really

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
feel like I've been in since I
showed up here on this planet,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost
like-- I've said it

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
so many times-- I now
feel, at the age of 72,

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that I've been in
ascendant master training

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:90%
since I was a child.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And something has
been watching over me,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
keeping me from going too
far astray, but pushing me

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:90%
towards the edge, and so on.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Did I become-- was Peter Deunov
and myself, can we become one?

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I absolutely believe
that's what happened, yes.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this
experience works.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
By allowing yourself to place
your awareness and attention

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
on what the experience
is, we become one.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
experience of oneness is.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you realize it, not
just in an intellectual level

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:90%
but on a very personal level.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you were talking
about having this Dharma,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
having this calling, it's very
interesting because the you

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:84%
who you are right
now existed also

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
when you were five
years old, or when

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
you were sitting
and watching that TV

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
show when you were saying,
I'm going to be on this Johnny

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Carson TV show someday, right?

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And the you who actually
was on that TV show

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:90%
existed at that moment, too.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it makes
me wonder, is it

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
our choices that get us where
we are or is it that future pull

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
of who we are and
we're just getting

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.709 align:middle line:84%
closer and closer with every
step we take to be that person?

00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Because they exist.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:90%
They're there right now.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So that everything
exists all at once,

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:84%
like a future being
that I am exists

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.584 align:middle line:90%
at this very same moment.

00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:26.625 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Just as the
two-year-old that you were,

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.319 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Which is what Einstein
taught us in quantum physics.

00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:31.916 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And quantum
physics teaches us, yeah.

00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in
Wayne's experience,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:84%
he had this experience of
the simultaneity of existence

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that he talked about, where the
past life that he experienced

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
was paralleled over onto
this time that he was alive.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that possible that
they can overlap like that

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:90%
in the same time frame?

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
This learning and
understanding came to me

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:90%
through many other clients.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, think of it this
way-- to us here on Earth,

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:90%
there is linear time, right?

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
We schedule things, we plan,
we talk about the past,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:90%
we think of the future.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.325 align:middle line:84%
And yet, to our soul, outside
of this earth they mention

00:19:12.325 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
in reality, there's no time.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So to our soul, everything
can be restructured

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and re-organized in
terms of lifetimes,

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:90%
much like a film strip, right?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
If you just want
to cut the scenes,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
you cut them and rearrange them
the way you want them to flow.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, our soul is not limited
by the linear progression

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
of time the way we have it here.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
sometimes a soul

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
will choose a period
of time in which

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
it will want to experience one,
two or many, many lifetimes.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.729 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:46.729 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the
theme that we've

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
lately is reincarnation

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and the soul coming in as
light, forming a solid body

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
and then going out as light.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So that would make
sense, that we

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.821 align:middle line:84%
can have various parallel soul
encounters at different times.

00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So do you feel that that
could have happened with you?

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
You came in here
as a curious child.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You were a lawyer and then
you turned into a past life

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.882 align:middle line:90%
regressionist.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.215 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I have already been
through a few incarnations

00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.172 align:middle line:84%
of my own just in
this life, right?

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did you make that--
what was that moment where you

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
decided, I'm no longer
going to practice law

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
go after-- did you

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
get a certification in
past life regression?

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.512 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It was a very
significant moment,

00:20:32.512 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:90%
but I have to tell you.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I had done
the work ahead of time

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
of soothing all
the fears, I didn't

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like I was jumping off
a cliff without a parachute,

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I did not feel that I was
going to smash my face.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And so it felt actually right.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It really felt-- it's now or
never, you know that feeling?

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What kind of work
ahead of time did you do?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I do a
lot of healing work

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
around my fears about money
and the validity of this work

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
because, you see, I was
raised with beliefs that it's

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
important that you have a
profession, like a lawyer

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:90%
or like a doctor.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.253 align:middle line:84%
And what is this thing that
our regression is, right?

00:21:13.253 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] And how about
the fear about money, right?

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because as an
attorney, I was really

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
in the top earning
bracket possible for me

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:90%
of where I was at that time.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, my fear was wait,
healers don't make money.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to pay the student
loans or the rent or so on.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, I realized that
if I were to leave my job

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have my own
alignment with this, even

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
if I want to keep
on doing the work

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and I feel so passionate about
it, things may not go so well.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- I'm so glad
I was wise in that way.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:90%
You did the work ahead of time.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.978 align:middle line:84%
That's a great piece
of advice for people

00:21:57.978 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
looking to jump into
different careers

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:90%
that they feel guided towards.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.398 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you said
you did a lot of work

00:22:04.398 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
on the validity of
past life regression.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens with the skeptics
that come to you and say,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
there's no way?

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you encounter these people?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I do.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I want
to tell you-- even

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
when people come to me
for personal sessions,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.094 align:middle line:84%
because I work with
people personally,

00:22:21.094 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they say
to me, you know what?

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm here because my daughter
wanted me to be here

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
because she's tired
of dealing with me

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or, you know,
another circumstance

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:90%
bringing them there.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And I particularly
remember working

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
with this woman who sat
down and said to me, listen,

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I am a Catholic school teacher.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in this.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to offend you.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm here simply because I
was asked by my daughter.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
She's tired of listening to me.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, this woman
has been separated

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:90%
from her husband for 18 years.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And during that entire time
she has been in counseling

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and not much progress
has been done.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
No forgiveness, no
healing, no moving on.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And so I said to her, that's OK.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful you are here.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And she had a profound,
profound experience.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And after I brought her
back, she opened her eyes

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and she said to me,
Mira, I feel transformed.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Thank you.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's really my
answer to people who

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:90%
are skeptical about this work.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Experience it for
yourself and see

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
what's possible because then
you can really criticize it

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and say how you feel about it.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is a
typical past life regression

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
session like?

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It's very
similar to meditation.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very gentle, very
easy and comfortable experience.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I guide people to
tune within and simply

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
by you releasing your focus
on the outside stimuli,

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
you're tuning within and all the
information is already there.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
These other lifetimes,
they're part of our energy,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:90%
our story, our frequency.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're right there
to be discovered.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then you take some
through visualization process.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.615 align:middle line:84%
And we have a video,
you can see where--

00:24:16.615 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:18.698 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --where it takes you.

00:24:18.698 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But tell us a
little bit about it.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Set us up here.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So you take someone to a journey
where they meet a spirit guide?

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And you did this with me,
which I'm so grateful for.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a three hour
session because you

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.885 align:middle line:84%
take a while to talk about
what are you desiring.

00:24:32.885 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And usually
it's people that desire

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:90%
some type of change, right?

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Yes, because I see the
value in past life regression

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
work in actually bringing
you to understanding

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and change-- not so much that
you have a fun story to tell

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:90%
your friends at a dinner party.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It's really more about
bringing awareness and healing

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could you have different
results at different times?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So the time where
I spoke to you,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I was in a really chaotic place.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had people saying at the
house and I had not stopped

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:90%
and it was total chaos.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.805 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted--
after I was done

00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
talking with you-- I realized
that I wanted so badly just

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to have some alone time because
every lifetime that came up

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.852 align:middle line:84%
for me was times where I was
so low and totally happy.

00:25:15.852 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which there were
profound lifetimes of-- I was

00:25:22.055 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%
a Lemurian, I was in Atlantis.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was this beautiful-- I
was the head of this kingdom

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.995 align:middle line:84%
that it was so peaceful that
it didn't need a leader.

00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: That was amazing.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.662 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So beautiful.

00:25:35.662 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
was crystal clear.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And my body was light
and it was very tall

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was luminescent,
like a blue.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.505 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting
on my kind of it

00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
was like an ice bed saying,
I don't need to live here.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be here anymore
because my work is done.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was lifetime after
lifetime of that theme that

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:90%
kept coming up for me.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you take somebody in to
the beginning of a regression,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
do you ask them to go
into like a transporting,

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.262 align:middle line:84%
into a bubble to
another place, right?

00:26:12.262 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Mm hmm.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And people are always
given what serves them

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.467 align:middle line:84%
in the best possible
way in that moment, what

00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
will guide them to move forward
in the most helpful way.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I were to do a
regression at another time,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.119 align:middle line:84%
you have different
needs at that time.

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:90%
You'll be in a different place.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:84%
You would be working
through new lessons.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Different people
will be in your life.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Different experiences will
be awakened within you.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And so naturally the regression
will be a different lifetime.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But even while I'm
saying this I'm thinking,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.230 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people revisit
the same lifetimes

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
just because they're still
working on the same lesson.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it that they're
truly lifetimes or is it

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.100 align:middle line:84%
just the psyche
working something out

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:90%
in a different way?

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: You know,
when people say to me,

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
is this real or am
I imagining this?

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I say to people, you know what?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
If you were to talk
to a quantum physicist

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
or if you were to talk
to a spiritual teacher,

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you
that everything

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:90%
exists in this now moment.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So even if you think you are
connecting with something that

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is out there, that you are
with the power of your mind

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:84%
pulling through and
imagining, you're

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
really already connecting with
something that already exists.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it's just your
moment of first becoming aware

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:90%
of it, right?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you were to
talk to a psychologist,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
they will do a
regular psychoanalysis

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
on the mind trips
that you take, right?

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So really,
what I say to people is,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I will try to have you say
to yourself rather than,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:90%
is this real, is this relevant.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the more
powerful question

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
because then you realize that
everything you experience is

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
always relevant
to where you are.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And it really serves you
and helps you move forward.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that
people don't always

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:90%
have human lifetimes, right?

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
experience lifetimes

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.738 align:middle line:90%
as flowers and monkeys.

00:28:07.738 --> 00:28:08.363 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:28:08.363 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Oh, yes.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Or wolves, or
dinosaurs, or people

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
see themselves as spirit
guides and angels,

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:84%
or on other dimensions
of existence

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
altogether, or as aliens
and on spaceships.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So really, that's why the
question, is this relevant,

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.395 align:middle line:84%
is so much more profound
because it really always serves

00:28:30.395 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and guides whatever is given.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there ever a
guide that ushers you through

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.540 align:middle line:90%
to show you the lifetime?

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever found that they
need a guide on the other side?

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Yeah,
sometimes people do.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:43.796 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:43.796 --> 00:28:44.754 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Someone's here.

00:28:44.754 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Every regression is
so different and so unique, yes.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love how you ask,
look down at your feet first.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%
What's on your feet?

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
There was one lifetime I
had where I had no feet.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: No feet.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.856 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I had no legs.

00:28:56.856 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I was paralyzed
from the waist down

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and my view was the
carpet on a ship.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.032 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- I can
recall it so clearly.

00:29:05.032 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Very clearly.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very clearly.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I took back
from that lifetime

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:90%
that I'm an athlete now.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And that every time
I've run or cycled

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that I
do, I do it to the fullest

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:90%
because I can.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I have always said that to
myself in my exercises--

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:90%
that I can.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes take myself
to exhaustion because I can,

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:90%
this lifetime.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I have legs.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I could completely break
down in tears about that right

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It's so real for me that
I didn't at one point

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and that I am so grateful now.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think I spent that whole
lifetime launching that desire

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.557 align:middle line:90%
to once walk again.

00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
is what really--

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's beautiful.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.249 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: --our
soul is seeking for,

00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that balance and
experiences because if you

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
have only one sided experience,
how is that learning?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, contrast.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.300 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly
launching contrast.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:29:59.977 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:29:59.977 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this video.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example of Mira
taking a group of people

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:90%
through a past life regression.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I want you now
to see, feel or imagine

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:84%
how you cross through
this threshold, how

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
you move into the light.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Move through the light and
come to the other side of it.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:29.545 align:middle line:84%
You are in a different
place, in a different time.

00:30:29.545 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to
orient yourself.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:90%
What is around you?

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:45.756 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.756 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
See, feel or hear
what is around you.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Look down at your feet and see
if you're wearing any footwear.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.785 align:middle line:84%
And if you are, what
does it look like?

00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.915 align:middle line:84%
Look at your legs
and at your torso.

00:31:18.915 --> 00:31:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.496 align:middle line:90%
Are you wearing any clothes?

00:31:24.496 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you are, what
do they look like?

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Stretch your hands
in front of you

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and see if you're holding
anything on your hands

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:51.080 align:middle line:84%
or if you have any
decorations on your hands,

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:90%
or any decorations on your body.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.344 align:middle line:90%
Are you a man or a woman?

00:32:04.344 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Does your energy feel like
the energy of a young person

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.255 align:middle line:90%
or an older person?

00:32:15.255 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it daytime or nighttime?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:90%
What is around you?

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Are there any others with you?

00:32:46.780 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
You can go backward
and forward in time

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.872 align:middle line:84%
to explore fully the
story of the lifetime

00:33:13.872 --> 00:33:14.913 align:middle line:90%
that you're experiencing.

00:33:14.913 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So explore the important
events in this lifetime.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything that
makes you feel uncomfortable,

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
you can just rise above the
scene and observe from above.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Without needing to
experience any discomfort,

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:90%
you can just rise above.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.409 align:middle line:84%
Do you recognize
any of the people

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
as people you now
share your life with?

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I want you now to go to the
last day of this lifetime

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and see how you pass away,
see the circumstances

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:84%
around the death
in that lifetime.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing how your spirit
transitions away from your body

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:56.045 align:middle line:84%
will forever free you of any
fears of death and dying.

00:34:56.045 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:84%
What lessons did you
learn in this lifetime?

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.810 align:middle line:84%
How is the life you experienced
connected to the person

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:90%
that you are today?

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That group that
you had in that room,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
did you find that anybody
reincarnates in groups

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:90%
or that they have soul groups?

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.845 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this phrase before.

00:35:39.845 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it happens for people.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I see it very often.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had the
opportunity to work

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
with a family of six sisters,
so I regressed the sisters.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I regressed some of the husbands
and the children in the family.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was such
a delight for you

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
because even though they were
not sharing between each other

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.047 align:middle line:84%
after sessions, when they
would have their regressions,

00:36:06.047 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:90%
they would see each other.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:90%
They would recognize each other.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that is
so common for all of us

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it's love
that connects us.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It's those common shared
lessons and desire

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:90%
to help each other learn.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And we change during lifetimes.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.710 align:middle line:84%
In one lifetime, somebody who's
your child will be your lover,

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
will be your grandmother
in another lifetime.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So we change our places
within the family

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and within the
connections we share.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:84%
But we always do it from
that place of love and care.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
you meet somebody,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
you have that instant bond
and recognition with them.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Or how about the feeling of
love at first sight, right?

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not about hormones.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It's that soul to soul,
immediate connection

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and saying--

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.616 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: --thank you.

00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:57.219 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:36:57.219 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I definitely believe that.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
What were some of your past
lives when you regressed?

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Do they make sense?

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the important part that you
ask at the end of each lifetime

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:84%
is what meaning
does this have to do

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:90%
with this life you have now?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:84%
What were some of yours and
how do they relate back?

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I love using
past life as a tool

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.370 align:middle line:90%
for my own transformation.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I do.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a CD set and I
listen to it myself.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:30.643 align:middle line:84%
Any time I need to-- I mean,
where do you go, right?

00:37:30.643 --> 00:37:31.143 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:31.143 --> 00:37:33.782 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Find the method that
works best for you, obviously.

00:37:33.782 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly, yes.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:90%
So I actually play the CD.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I play the recording.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And I have experiences, no
matter what I'm going through--

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:84%
be it a challenge in
communicating with someone,

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
be it the desire to grow in
my work, be it whatever it is.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I just know that the answer will
be presented and given to me.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.804 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have so
many stories, yes.

00:37:54.804 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.189 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it makes sense
as to where you are now?

00:37:58.189 --> 00:37:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: They always do.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they always do.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
As I was mentioning
to you, it's always

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
appropriate for where you
are and what is happening

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and what is going
on in your life.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a profound,
profound tool in that way.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was one
of your lifetimes?

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.065 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a career
shift or somebody found you

00:38:18.065 --> 00:38:20.646 align:middle line:84%
that was famous and
put you on their stage?

00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: [LAUGHS] Oh,
I should tell you this.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So I was working as an
attorney and at that time,

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I was very much struggling
with the path forward.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Even though I made it sound
like it was easy for me

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to transition into
doing regression work,

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:90%
it was not an easy process.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It took a few years.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
progressed to a lifetime.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was a future life.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized
that it was me.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.745 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
shooting here in Denver

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm
thinking of that life.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So I saw myself
living here in Denver.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there is a bookshelf
with all of these books written

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%
by Mira Kelley.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
these books and I'm

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:84%
amazed because wait-- I
haven't written a single book

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
plans to write books.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was this beautiful
recognition of family and kids

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.890 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that that's
a potential future for me.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.217 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it terrified me and
I was saying, absolutely not.

00:39:22.217 --> 00:39:22.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:22.716 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:90%
You saw that back then.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Not me.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely not me,
but here we are.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't written 16
books, but we'll get to that.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.689 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:31.689 --> 00:39:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you bring
up a great point

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
about can past life
go into the future.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about
that in the intro

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.343 align:middle line:84%
because that was my experience
when I went into the regression

00:39:40.343 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:90%
with you, is I went forward.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:84%
That was amazing
because what I was

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.933 align:middle line:90%
seeing hasn't been created yet.

00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I love bringing people
to future lifetimes.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
it's just as easy

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to experience a past life
as it is a future life,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:90%
as you experienced for yourself.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.020 align:middle line:90%
It makes no difference because--

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
of the parallel--

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.635 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:40:01.635 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, your mind
is not bound by time

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:84%
when you're in that deep
state of relaxation,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
so you can really
move in any direction.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I love
when people connect

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:84%
with future lifetimes is
because-- or especially

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:84%
the future of the present
life, as in my case--

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:90%
it gives you possibilities.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
You open up to potentials that
you haven't even considered.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course these
are potentials.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to
make the choices

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and really align with them.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know that it was a
future lifetime because what

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.354 align:middle line:90%
I saw has not been created yet.

00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Right.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:41.519 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was very,
very futuristic--

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.650 align:middle line:84%
office pods where
we communicated

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.180 align:middle line:84%
completely and entirely
telepathically,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:90%
and ideas circulated.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The whole pod and
then the department

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that felt that
they could manifest

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.315 align:middle line:84%
it would take on that
telepathic communication

00:40:58.315 --> 00:40:59.555 align:middle line:90%
and bring it into reality.

00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:03.047 align:middle line:84%
It was really cool,
the whole future.

00:41:03.047 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so I know
that that isn't around.

00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen it
in video or anything.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was wonderful.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:90%
We teleported to our offices.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
However, so these can-- in
terms of quantum physics--

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:90%
could exist in a parallel space.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Absolutely.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.863 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do
you know if somebody

00:41:20.863 --> 00:41:22.220 align:middle line:90%
is willing to go there?

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you have
to be suggestible,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:84%
as one would be if they
were to go to a hypnosis?

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: It's not necessary.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a very simple process
of just tuning within.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us has actually
had an experience of it

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:84%
by driving for,
say, a few minutes

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and not even knowing how
you got to your destination

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:84%
because you were doing
it on auto pilot.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Or going to see a movie and you
get so involved in the story

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that once the movie's over,
you say to yourself, but wait.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually not in the movie.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm myself.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I have my own life.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
That kind of separation.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.137 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very simple
process that anybody can do.

00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:90%
So now, questions.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Do we find our soulmates?

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Do we have multiple soulmates?

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Because we-- as
we spoke earlier about us

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:84%
traveling in groups and changing
the roles that we play for one

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
another, the people who are the
loves of our life in this life

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
very well could have been
that in another lifetime,

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:33.225 align:middle line:84%
or they could've been our twin
sister, or they could've been--

00:42:33.225 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our children.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.849 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly.

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So because of that,
I prefer to think

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.810 align:middle line:84%
of soulmates as the
mates of your soul

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.180 align:middle line:84%
who are here to reflect back at
you the challenges, the growth

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
to experience.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So with that definition,
really, anybody

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:84%
who comes across into
our life is there

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to give us a gift--
a gift of reflection

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we know more
of ourselves and grow.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes
to that profound sense

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.670 align:middle line:84%
of being seen and
sharing with a lover,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
it's really very beautiful
when people connect and explore

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
their connections with their
lovers or their challenges

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
through past life
regression, and get answers.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever been
able to heal a rough divorce

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:84%
or mend a relationship
by having somebody

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.340 align:middle line:90%
go through a regression?

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Most definitely.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Most definitely.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:90%
People have had that.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
By seeing the bigger picture
and understanding the lessons

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I forgive, and oh
how amazing, and thank you.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the gifts that
come from that relationship

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or with children who
have maybe passed on

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.716 align:middle line:84%
or-- have you ever counseled
someone who's lost a child?

00:43:41.716 --> 00:43:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: For parents
who have-- yes, I

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.920 align:middle line:84%
have-- parents who have lost
children, the release of grief

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is profound when they
get to see that they

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
have been in other
lifetimes with that soul.

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they get to
share and communicate

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.050 align:middle line:84%
with the soul of the child and
get that affirmation for it

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:90%
was my time.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It was simply my time.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for allowing me
to come for this little.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:90%
You learned so much.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Those must be incredibly
powerful sessions.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Very moving, yeah.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So talking
about karma here.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you see people come back to
relive karma through past lives

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
where they felt maybe
they saw in a past life

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that they were horrible
or really good?

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Rather than thinking
about karma's punishment

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and judgment, I want to share
with people a new perspective.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I would rather have
people think of it

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.840 align:middle line:84%
as balancing because
karma is simply

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.450 align:middle line:84%
the desire of the soul to learn
from different points of view.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's really nothing
judgmental about it

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.420 align:middle line:84%
because there's
nobody keeping score.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It's really you wanting to learn
and balance those experiences.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And also whenever
karma-- that energy

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that we call karma, that
repetitive pattern of wait,

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.910 align:middle line:84%
this is the same story
again-- shows up in your life,

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I really want to ask you to use
that energy rather than saying,

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I feel powerless and there's
nothing I can do about it.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I want to have you
say, this is a pattern

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that is happening so I
can actually transform it.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason why when
you go through regression

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:32.040 align:middle line:84%
you experience so many lifetimes
of feeling disempowered

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and working through
the same lesson

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is because when we are
in physical reality,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:84%
we are not getting
that we are the master

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.330 align:middle line:90%
creators of our life.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead, when we are
living our lives,

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we have this feeling that
it's everybody else's fault

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so limited and
there's nothing I can do.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're really not utilizing
the reason why you're here--

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.960 align:middle line:84%
to know your power,
to know yourself

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.910 align:middle line:90%
as the creator of your life.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so naturally, that's
really the reason why

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.350 align:middle line:90%
we have so many incarnations.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And so once you become aware
of that energy of karma,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:90%
use it in the positive way.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Use it so that you say,
OK, there's a lesson.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Let me actually focus on
it and work through it.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Because here's one
thing I promise you--

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.070 align:middle line:90%
no challenge is bigger than you.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.090 align:middle line:84%
You set it up for
yourself anyway.

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.399 align:middle line:90%
How could it be bigger than you?

00:46:24.399 --> 00:46:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You knew ahead of time.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.864 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, exactly.

00:46:26.864 --> 00:46:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You nailed
it on the head there.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
The whole perspective--
wrapping this whole thing

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:84%
into a giant package,
you said-- is learning

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:84%
This past life
regression is a way

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to learn from a
different point of view.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it also does
explain a lot of things.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So like I could feel
like certain people

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that I meet I say--
I immediately think

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.406 align:middle line:90%
we have a sister like bond.

00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:52.821 align:middle line:84%
Like if I were to
have a sister, I

00:46:52.821 --> 00:46:54.530 align:middle line:84%
would want it to be
you, type of thing.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if I went
back and found,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:84%
hey, this person is a
sister in a past life.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a tumultuous
relationship with somebody,

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you could look back and
see how could that heal.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So if I do have a rocky
relationship with someone

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and I go back and I found
out-- the typical example--

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:84%
typical-- somebody killed you
in a past life or something

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.070 align:middle line:90%
like that-- how would that heal?

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So that
usually heals when

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.111 align:middle line:84%
those two people
are brought together

00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:22.857 align:middle line:90%
in very close proximity.

00:47:22.857 --> 00:47:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So I know that everybody who has
a challenge with their mother

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or their father is perking,
watching us talk about this,

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and saying, wait, could
this be the case for me?

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
encourage them to look

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:84%
into it because that
forgiveness comes

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:84%
once you have heard
somebody or you

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:90%
have been heard by somebody.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Understanding, compassion
and forgiveness

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.140 align:middle line:84%
comes when you are in very
close proximity and need

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to be together all
the time so you

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.160 align:middle line:90%
can push each other's buttons.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can really work
through this, then come

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:56.380 align:middle line:90%
on the other end of it.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And so really, the
soul who's challenging

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.090 align:middle line:84%
you the most on a
soul level, they're

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.480 align:middle line:84%
your best friend because you're
saying, let's do this together.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.185 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be easy, but it

00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:08.400 align:middle line:90%
will get us to better places.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever
experienced a lifetime

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:13.140 align:middle line:84%
where somebody did
kill that person

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and they came back
into this lifetime too

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.860 align:middle line:90%
have you ever seen that?

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:90%
You have?

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Let me
tell you a story.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I worked with this child-- well,
at the time he was not a child.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.750 align:middle line:90%
He was a 16-year-old boy.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But when he was
three years old, he

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.380 align:middle line:84%
started developing a
paralysis in the body.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So a muscular dystrophy
was taking over the body.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I met him, he was
only able to move his fingers

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and with a little motion there,
and his facial muscles so he

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.630 align:middle line:90%
can talk and eat.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he was completely
dependent on being

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.950 align:middle line:90%
taken care of by his family.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And he experienced
another lifetime

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:58.260 align:middle line:90%
where he was a Roman senator.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
political unfoldings

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.090 align:middle line:84%
going on where he
was wrongly accused.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was nailed to the
cross-- because back then

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that was a normal execution.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, as he was standing
there on the cross dying,

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.370 align:middle line:84%
he shared with me that
he sees underneath him--

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:84%
he sees on the street,
on the ground--

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
he sees his father, his
uncle, his mother, his sister.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And his father was the
person who accused him.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:84%
His uncle was the
person who nailed him.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.570 align:middle line:84%
His mother was also his
mother in that lifetime,

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:38.100 align:middle line:84%
just crying and praying
for her adult son.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was such a healing
moment-- not just for him,

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:46.190 align:middle line:84%
but also for the whole
family because in this life,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:84%
he's their cross to bear because
they have to take care of him,

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:50.885 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:50.885 --> 00:49:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: So it really
gave them a lot of comfort,

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.251 align:middle line:90%
a lot of understanding.

00:49:58.251 --> 00:49:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's enormous.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: It didn't
feel irrelevant.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It didn't feel random.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It just felt profound.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you talk
to him afterwards?

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Did he have more of a
comfortability in his body

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:90%
with his condition?

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It didn't heal it, but he
felt different about it.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.505 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: An understanding, yes.

00:50:15.505 --> 00:50:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is huge.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you have story
after story about that.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:84%
What about when
somebody has committed

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.709 align:middle line:90%
suicide in a past life?

00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Have you spoken with
someone like-- can you

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.320 align:middle line:90%
tell us a story about that?

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: I have.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So because we're
touching upon this--

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
suicide is actually

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.200 align:middle line:84%
something that has crossed
many people's minds, so let

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.520 align:middle line:84%
me start off by saying,
please don't do it

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.860 align:middle line:84%
because committing
suicide is the fastest way

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.630 align:middle line:90%
to actually be reborn.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So please don't
think that suicide

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.107 align:middle line:84%
is a solution to actually
running away from life.

00:50:51.107 --> 00:50:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you'll
come back with the same set

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of circumstances?

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.295 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I mentioned,
there's nobody

00:50:56.295 --> 00:50:59.379 align:middle line:84%
in heaven keeping tabs on you
and saying, oh wait, wait.

00:50:59.379 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:90%
You didn't complete this.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.336 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go back.

00:51:01.336 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Or you did this well.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's your soul who is
setting up the lessons

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and the learnings and
the circumstances.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're accountable
to yourself.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, the moment
you transition into spirit,

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:84%
you say, I'm
disappointed in myself.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I should have done better.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Let me go and try again.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And so please don't
even consider that.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Stay with it-- not
meaning suicide.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Please stay with it.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, things
always get better.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.175 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you had many
people that have chosen life?

00:51:32.175 --> 00:51:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yeah.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I have experienced
people committing suicide

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.160 align:middle line:90%
in other lifetimes.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they share

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.020 align:middle line:84%
with me, with
their spirit guides

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.226 align:middle line:84%
or through their
own understanding.

00:51:44.226 --> 00:51:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back and
stick with it this time.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:90%
That kind of awareness.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:90%
That's enormous.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So have you-- how many of these
regressions do you do a day?

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they are three
hour processes, right?

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Yes, yes, yes.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're shorter.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, I do shorter
regressions with people.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
look to explore deeper

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and go real deep.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:90%
There's a limit, right?

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:15.971 align:middle line:84%
And how did you learn
the regression patterns

00:52:15.971 --> 00:52:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that worked?

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.053 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's
been trial and error

00:52:18.053 --> 00:52:19.260 align:middle line:90%
over the last several years.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.400 align:middle line:84%
How long have you
been doing this?

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.358 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: I've been doing
this for a few years.

00:52:22.358 --> 00:52:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it's
really experience

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that gives you that
profound understanding

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and marvel at who we are.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process that you can
share and learn with others.

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I teach people how
to do past life regression

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.290 align:middle line:84%
by simply sharing my script
and my book Beyond Past Lives.

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I have my script and
I offer it to people

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.820 align:middle line:84%
so that they can practice
with others because it's

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.580 align:middle line:90%
an easy thing to do.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to see
more people using that

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:90%
as a tool for transformation.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can record this--
the script-- onto your phone

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.114 align:middle line:84%
or whatever device and take
yourself into a regression.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: The process.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Or just get one of my
recordings and do the same, too.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.200 align:middle line:90%
People can do it on their own.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't need me.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They can absolutely
do it on their own

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and still have
profound experiences.

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.520 align:middle line:84%
How does this relate to
a near death experience?

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything similar there?

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: There is a beautiful
correlation between the two

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:31.340 align:middle line:84%
because when people have
near death experiences,

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:84%
they come back and they share
about the simultaneity of time.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Anita Moorjani has
a story like that.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.570 align:middle line:84%
When she transitions, she saw
the two records side by side--

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the two parallel realities of
having died from this condition

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.010 align:middle line:84%
or having been healed
because she chose to live.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Chose it.

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And so
that's actually really

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.930 align:middle line:84%
what resonated most with
me when I read her story

00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and excited me to share it with
Wayne Dyer and with others.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Or people in their near
death experiences talk

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:08.980 align:middle line:84%
about meeting with
other beings--

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:84%
with divine beings of light,
what the other side is like.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It's really a very
beautiful parallel side

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.280 align:middle line:84%
by side unfolding of us knowing
more about the universe.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you must
be a history buff now

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.456 align:middle line:90%
because of all--

00:54:23.456 --> 00:54:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To learn about
Atlantis and periods of history

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It's been fascinating.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I immediately went
and was attracted

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to all sorts of different
information around Atlantis

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and Leumeria because
of that experience,

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and I identified
and saw pictures

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of-- because I hadn't
really done a deep dive

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:45.270 align:middle line:90%
into that subject in the past.

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I saw a lot of what I had seen
visually in that experience.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.575 align:middle line:90%
It came to life for me.

00:54:50.575 --> 00:54:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Really wonderful because
you go and you seek it out

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and you find it.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what Wayne did.

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.093 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: And it's
really extraordinary when

00:54:56.093 --> 00:54:57.820 align:middle line:90%
you receive that confirmation.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It really affirms everything
on such a beautiful level.

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
wonderful because you're not

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.643 align:middle line:84%
saying you're a psychic,
or you're a medium,

00:55:05.643 --> 00:55:06.680 align:middle line:90%
or channeling all this.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.289 align:middle line:84%
You're saying this is
a tool anyone can use--

00:55:09.289 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Anyone can use.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --for
transformation and really

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.640 align:middle line:84%
looking at life from a different
perspective, and for healing.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLEY: Exactly.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very practical.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for joining
me and for your assistance

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.064 align:middle line:90%

00:55:22.064 --> 00:55:23.813 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLEY: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:55:23.813 --> 00:55:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.670 align:middle line:84%
