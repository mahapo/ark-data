>>LISA GARR: We've all
heard the adage, the only

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:90%
constant in life is change.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are surprised or
frustrated when change happens.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:84%
In this ever-shifting economic
and technological landscape,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
it's become crucial to
learn the skills needed

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to adapt when change
happens, whether it's

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
a sudden job loss, or
an unexpected accident,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:90%
or a difficult breakup.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:10%
Hi.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, and joining
me is career success coach

and bestselling author Tama
Kieves, who knows firsthand

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
the fear and paralysis that
accompanies drastic life

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:10%
changes.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:10%
Tama talks about her
journey in her latest book,

>>TAMA KIEVES: [LAUGHS]

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, what a story.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
you went to Harvard

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and you graduated with honors?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
From Harvard Law School.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a perfect example
of resisting change.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:10%
Like you said in the beginning
of-- just resisting change,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:10%
or--

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:10%
we always want to be safe.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
We always want to be secure.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:10%
We always want to
do the right thing.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:10%
And when I was younger, I
knew that I wanted to write.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
That was my dream.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But I grew up in
Brooklyn, New York,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to an orthodox Jewish
family, and writing was not

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
a safe path.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Write?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean, anyway?

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:90%
You want to write?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I want to--

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
exact-- that's
basically what I got.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
You're going to write?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.427 align:middle line:84%
You're going to starve,
you're going to write.

00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Right,
because what does that mean?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They just-- it didn't
sound like a career path.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:90%
It sounded like a hobby.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I ignored that desire,
like so many people,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and I did what is
"safe" or practical.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.022 align:middle line:84%
And I went off to
law school instead,

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and to Harvard Law School,
and graduated with honors.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was on partnership
track in a major law firm.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And like so many
people, I was just miserable.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.685 align:middle line:90%
I was empty.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I have to ask you,
how did your parents feel?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: [LAUGHS]

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --here you are as
proud parents of a graduated--

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.758 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Very proud parents.

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
money that it takes--

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
oh, and we have some photos
here of you graduating.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm a parent.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I would've been proud of you.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.905 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Oh, yes.

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:31.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What happened?

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: My mother was
bragging in every synagogue,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
for all she was worth.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
My little girl.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to tell you.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: They were horrified,
because I at one point

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:90%
just walked out of everything.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I just walked out of everything.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way, you
will do, or you may

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.397 align:middle line:90%
do, if you're unhappy enough.

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: If you are fed up.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I was just so
unhappy, and I was dying.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And thank god somebody said
something amazing to me.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
He said, think about it.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If you've been this
successful doing

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
something you don't love--

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]
That's a great--

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: What could you
do with what you love?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great point.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I always wonder,
though, when people

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:90%
want to make a drastic change.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.093 align:middle line:84%
You never have everything
happen all at once.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It's this thing and then the
next thing, and it surmounts.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you want to escape.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%
You want to just leave it all.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Some people do that.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They just cold turkey
and leave it all.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or you stay.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.522 align:middle line:90%
There's no easy way to do it.

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And I am so
glad you brought that up,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think there's
a right way or a wrong way

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, everybody is
looking for the perfect answer.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Or you read self-help books
and they're like, well,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
she did this extreme thing, so
I should do the extreme thing.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.133 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And when I'm
working with clients,

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
everybody has their own
chemistry, their own way,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and for those of--

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I did a drastic change because
I couldn't do it any other way.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I was dying.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I had to get out.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
If you can do it another
way-- if you can do something

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
on the side or
experiment, why not?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you got
a job at a law firm.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm-hmm.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
working at the law firm.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Did you get to write there?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.488 align:middle line:84%
Did you get to express
yourself at all?

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: [LAUGHS] That's
a-- you sound like my mother.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.186 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:07.186 --> 00:04:07.592 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I'm teasing you.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Because she was
like, you're writing.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.507 align:middle line:90%
You're writing briefs.

00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- but it's
almost like saying to Picasso,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
who's painting garages
or something-- well,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:90%
you're painting!

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.376 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Being a lawyer was
such a different modality,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.073 align:middle line:84%
and it was such a different--
it was linear thought.

00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with it.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It was just that I had this
creative impulse in me--

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
this desire to be
something else.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing work that
really isn't what you love,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:90%
it can take more of your energy.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:90%
It can exhaust you.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you
use your lawyer

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
energy or that analytical
energy in what you do now?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: In some ways, yes.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.473 align:middle line:84%
I always tell my clients,
I'm like your advocate.

00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer a lawyer,
but I'm your advocate.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to prove
the case of you.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to prove
your potential.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.738 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And I
think the other way

00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I use it is it gives me
credibility, because I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
am about following an inspired
path-- the path of genius,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
listening to an inner
voice, and being visionary.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And it just gives it
credibility that I have made it

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:90%
in the, quote, "real world."

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have found a different
kind of power to use.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

who is in that place,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that is in that dead
end, non-creative space,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.075 align:middle line:84%
they want to make a change,
what would you suggest?

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather than-- well, would you
shock your family in saying

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving you.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Just
shock your family.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]
That's a great--

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.593 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:36.393 align:middle line:90%
You can too.

00:05:36.393 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: You can too.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Send them to therapy

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:90%

>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the main
thing that I would say

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:90%
is just start experimenting--

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to make
any huge change right away.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Of that again, everybody has
their path and their way.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe a path is
already inside you.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just
want you to experiment.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.395 align:middle line:84%
Because some people think, oh,
I want to be a photographer,

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or I want to be a this,
or I want to be a that.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.282 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:02.282 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: How about you
experimenting a little bit

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
before you go jump off a cliff?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Join a club.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Do something as a hobby first.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Take a class.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: You know?

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You can do something
on a Wednesday night.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to quit your job.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But for those who
want to take that leap

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and take that risk,
is there an easy way?

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess easy is
not the right word.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Is there another way to do
it that's gentler on yourself

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and your loved ones?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I wish there was.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Certainly if you're
conscious enough

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
where you can have that
great communication, sure.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But to make a change like that,
at least for me, I was dying.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I was out of my mind in pain.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.063 align:middle line:84%
I was in depression of, I
didn't want to make this change.

00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't consciously
want to make this change.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of investment
into doing this.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And that path seemed secure,
and that path seemed reasonable,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and it was kind of fun.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
You say you're a Harvard
lawyer, everybody respects you.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You say you're a
poet, not so much.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You know?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:90%

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
of my being on some
level, or my mind,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
did not want to
make that change.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But my soul, my gut,
my heart, my genius,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
something else beyond me did.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And so at the time, it
is a little cataclysmic.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:90%
There is a grieving process.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Like one life or one
identity is leaving.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:90%

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
find a different way.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.237 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
hang up the suits?

00:07:30.237 --> 00:07:31.335 align:middle line:90%

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
interesting, though.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you let go
what wasn't working.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I will say-- and just
to be clear, when I left,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:90%
I was not clear that that's it.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving forever.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a next step.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
It was oh, my god,
I am dying here.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally in therapy,
and I literally at one point

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
was considering at some
point ending my life.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.903 align:middle line:90%
I was so depressed.

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to the therapist

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:90%
about not wanting to live.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
could leave your job.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
leave the planet.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:90%

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%

That's one of the main

That's why I wrote my books is,
I want my books and my words

And then on the other
side, if you were a parent

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and you see this culture of kids

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
up, and the learning
curve goes up,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and the stress, and
these standardized tests,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
There is no "follow your
dream" category in college.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And I think that's
a really hard thing, that I

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
think for parents, it's undoing
our usual way of thinking.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
We learned, be a doctor.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Be a lawyer.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Be a professional.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Be a this.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Make money.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Make money is the
source of success.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And I want to educate people
that happiness and health

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and doing your right life
is your greatest success.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And so as a parent,
maybe it is, you're

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
giving your kid permission

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And so for me,
the greatest security,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, is doing
what you came here to do.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And to your point about--

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.583 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: OK, OK, but how
do you pay the mortgage?

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you pay
for the apartment?

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not an either/or.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
have to do one thing.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
That again, you
might do many thi--

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you might do different
things on the side.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
term in the literature--

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
it's my favorite
term, and it's called

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
"multiple streams of income."

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.748 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: All the love.

00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is what
we're heading towards.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Gen X, Y,
Z, and every generation

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
is now either
getting a side hustle

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.797 align:middle line:84%
or some type of entrepreneurial
spirit is happening.

00:11:13.797 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: And it needs to.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.845 align:middle line:90%
Our culture is changing so much.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:84%
What used to be the
track of security

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:90%
is no longer a competitive edge.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.235 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Companies want
to see that you're adept--

00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
abdapta-- I can't
even say the word.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Adaptable.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You know?

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: They want to see that
you can do different things.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything's changing.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer one track.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
used to maybe think

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
was erratic or not
focused, I think

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
now is multi-talented
or multi-passionate.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to use
different strengths.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, look.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You are a great example.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to be a writer.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you probably
make your money as a coach.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Exac-- you know--

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And when
I started writing,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I realized I wanted to
be around other writers,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and so I started
a support group.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And people said,
oh my god, you're

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:90%
good at speaking or teaching.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.663 align:middle line:90%
And so I started teaching.

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started
teaching, people said,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:90%
would you ever lead retreats?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
leading retreats.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And people started asking me
to work individually with them.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so-- before coaching
was even a living.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And so I make my
money in li-- going back

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
to that multiple income streams.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I make my money as a coach.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I make my money as a speaker.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I make my money as an author.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I make my money doing retreats.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.592 align:middle line:84%
Some months, I'm not making
as much money speaking,

00:12:24.592 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
but I'm making more
money coaching.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.375 align:middle line:84%
Some months, coaching is
down, but writing is up.

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one thing
leads to the next,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
as long as you just
take the first step.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And this also applies to someone
who is maybe being laid off,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
or it's not their
choice to go and find--

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you've got that mourning
period of losing your job

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with that, and
having to pick yourself up

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it
one step at a time?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.455 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you're done this?

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: That's the
only way that I know it.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.747 align:middle line:84%
In "Thriving Through
Uncertainty,"

00:12:52.747 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter on
following the breadcrumbs.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Just following the breadcrumbs.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking
for the master

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.623 align:middle line:90%
plan and their whole life.

00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to figure
out their whole life.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I'm this age
and I have this, that,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and I have this whatever.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going
to ask you to do

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is follow what's
speaking to you now.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you love now?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:90%
What's moving you now?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But to your point of
when you get laid off--

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right?

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.258 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Everybody
immediately thinks OK, I've

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:90%
got to jump into that next job.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But there is that moment of
grieving or sadness or fear.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody wants
to know, what do I do?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a path of
undoing and undoing.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is undoing the fears,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
undoing all the horrible
stories you're telling yourself.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is when
you're in fear and anxiety,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%
you can't hear inspiration.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't be listening to
inspiration and guidance

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and fear and anxiety
at the same time.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it is the common
default mechanism of change.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Fear is.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Sure is.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It really is.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And we get fed so much fear
from various media sources

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.895 align:middle line:84%
that it really is
all about the fear.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you on the
edge of the seat,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and the fear and the fear.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And talking about thriving
through uncertainty.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about how
much uncertainty there

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
is right now in the world.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've got
financial uncertainty.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
We've got environmental
uncertainty.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We've got relationship
uncertainty,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:90%
religious uncertainty.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're talking about
thriving through all this?

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.305 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Thriving
through uncertainty.

00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:26.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:26.112 --> 00:14:27.408 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: [LAUGHS]

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:90%
But what's--

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: First of all, I always
write what I need to learn.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:90%
So full disclosure.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I write what
the heck I need to learn.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think the world is
in rock and roll times.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in a
wildly different time.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.552 align:middle line:90%
There's so much going on.

00:14:44.552 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And so in "Thriving
Through Uncertainty,"

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how uncertainty
is actually your superpower.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And what I mean by that--

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
why say it's your
superpower, is when

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
all the answers in the world
aren't doing it for you

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
anymore, there's no solidity.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no one expert.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no stability.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for the first
time, we're going

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to start listening to
ourselves and to our instincts

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and to our genius.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I know-- as a coach, I
know that the path is already

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:90%
inside you.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
You already have an answer.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a stability
in each of us.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not external.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so
interesting, because after you

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
have this level of uncertainty,
you feel like playing small.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Being very contracted.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I was having
this conversation with myself

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
this week of, how
am I going to handle

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
all the things I need to handle
from this tiny little box?

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to work.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I have got to expand
myself in order

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to have the capacity to
handle the things that

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:90%
are coming at me.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.488 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, everything
else is going

We all immediately
contract, because we're

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:90%
trying to stay in control.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of being more than you
ever dreamed you could be,

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.305 align:middle line:84%

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:84%
playing small in a way
that society thinks is big.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And what I mean by that--

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I like your look.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] What I mean by that is
that when I was practicing law,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
everybody thought, oh,
she's in that big time.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:90%
She's playing big.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:84%
That was actually
playing small for me,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't my real dream.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my real self.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I was playing it safe.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I was doing what everybody
else thought was OK,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:90%
so that was playing small.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:90%

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%

Depending on what

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think failure was
the biggest fear I had,

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:90%
of all of them.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Not even money-- failure
was my biggest fear,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:90%
because it was a--

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:84%
I was groomed for success,
and I had this swanky job.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was so afraid that I'm
going to go off to find myself,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's going to go, she
should have kept her day job.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
Of just-- I was so
afraid of failure.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But there was this one fantasy
that kept coming to me of,

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:90%
I kept--

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I had this fantasy that
at the end of my own life,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
there would be all these
beings in white robes.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And they would
show me everything

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:90%
my life was meant to be.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
They would show me the final
movie explaining your life.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And they would show
me here was the books

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:90%
you were going to write.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Here were the people
you were going to help.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Here was the editors lining up.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Here was the agent.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Here was the publisher.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You weren't meant
to practice law.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
On Sunday nights, when you
were throwing up miserable,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:90%
we thought you knew.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:90%
But no, you had willpower.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:90%
You kept going.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And I had that fantasy.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my god.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't get to
the end of my life

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and realize I could
have been a writer.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:90%
I could have been an author.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I could have lived my dreams.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only
one stopping myself.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I always tell
people that as much

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:84%
as you may fear failure, I
think you fear regret more.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:90%

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.955 align:middle line:84%

00:18:20.955 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It was just that thing of,
I can't face my own life

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:90%
knowing I didn't even try it.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing if you try
it and it doesn't work

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and the world stops
you a million times.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:90%
But to stop ourselves.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't bear that.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.073 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I always ask

everybody wants to immediately
think, OK, that's it.

well, I'll make it practical.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:90%

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
a little bit too
far into the future

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
- A lot of us, by the way,
have been successful in life

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because we've known how
to undercut ourselves.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We've known that--
we've been successful

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
because we know how
to clip our wings,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
or be what we think
other people want.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the path
of authenticity,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
the path of really going for
our passion, the path of really

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:90%
going out there, is--

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
it's that fear of, my
god, we may lose approval.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
You may lose other
people, but it's worth it,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
you to lose yourself.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you lose yourself, you
lose everyone and everything.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago,
I was really scared

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of what my father would
say when I left law.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I always joke about my mother,
but I was really scared

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:84%
about my father, because
he was really volatile.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he
would excommunicate me

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:90%
from the family.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I really did, because he was--

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.337 align:middle line:90%
he could be like that.

00:22:51.337 --> 00:22:53.472 align:middle line:90%
He was really a volatile guy.

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was terrified,
and I remember

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
telling a therapist at the time,
I don't want to lose his love.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to lose my father.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to lose his love.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, if
you could lose somebody

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
by being who you are, then
you don't have their love.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:90%

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
If you could lose somebody
by being who you are,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.972 align:middle line:90%
then you don't have their love.

00:23:13.972 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then years
later, I discovered

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
"A Course in Miracles,"
which I teach and I love.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course of Miracles" says,
nothing real can be threatened.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing real can be threatened.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.230 align:middle line:84%

tell my father.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I prepared.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I went to god knows how
many therapy sessions.

God knows, right?

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.638 align:middle line:84%
I told my father and
he just went, eh.

00:23:33.638 --> 00:23:34.438 align:middle line:90%

[LAUGHS] It's just amazing, so--

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.595 align:middle line:84%
but by the way, I never
felt so loved in my life.

I never felt so
loved in my life,

excommunicate me.

And that was probably his way
of saying, I love you madly.

and I think that's
the amazing thing,

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Just put it in the river.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Which makes no sense.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: It's--
[LAUGHS] it was like,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.923 align:middle line:90%
what kind of plan is that?

00:25:52.923 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Please give me something linear.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was this guidance,
and I knew what it meant.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
It meant, get it out
there some way, somehow.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Self-publish it if you have to.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Put your own money
into it if you have to.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Just get it into
the stream of life.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
If it's supposed to
go somewhere, it will.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But you know how, like I
was saying before, you get

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:90%
answers you don't want to hear?

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.867 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I don't
want that answer.

00:26:10.867 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- but
anyways I ended up

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
having the guts to finally
self-publish my first book

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:90%
after all of this.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And it started spreading
through word of mouth.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
It hit "The Denver
Post" bestseller list.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It hit "The Business"
bestseller list.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And then four months
after I self-published,

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I got an email from a woman
who worked for Random House.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
She was in marketing and
publicity as a vice president.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
career transition,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and she had somehow found
my self-published book

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote, "Your fairy
godmother has arrived."

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Your fairy godmother--
that's the email.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote to
me and said it was

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the best book she'd
ever read on finding

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.027 align:middle line:90%
your calling and your dream.

00:26:50.027 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get it published
by a New York publisher.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it was this amazing,
amazing thing about,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:90%
you can't plan that.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
How can you plan that I'm
going to have a meltdown for 12

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.215 align:middle line:90%
years writing this book?

00:27:01.215 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Some other woman at
the end of 12 years

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a
meltdown in her own career.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
She's going to find it.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I'm going
to go to my next level.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But I deeply know that everybody
has something extraordinary

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.878 align:middle line:84%
in them, and if they follow that
breadcrumb moment by moment,

00:27:15.878 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get to
someplace they could never have

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.823 align:middle line:90%
gotten in a conventional way.

00:27:19.823 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You seem to
receive a lot of guidance.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a practice
through meditation, or--

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.827 align:middle line:90%
what is your practice?

00:27:25.827 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I receive
a lot of guidance,

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
because I have a lot of fear.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you're always active.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.307 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I have a
very active mind.

00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would never have
been able to tell that.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: No, I'm
sure you couldn't.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I hide it really well.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes a team to
manage this brain.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.352 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:27:39.352 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can see that.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of energy.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I have
a lot of energy.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.817 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And if
this energy isn't

00:27:43.817 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
directed towards something
positive and useful,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.478 align:middle line:90%
it's not good.

00:27:47.478 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I teach people.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.145 align:middle line:84%
You can use your
mind either way.

00:27:50.145 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question about my--

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Guidance.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: --practice
and guidance,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I've taught "A
Course in Miracles"

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:84%
for close to 30 years,
and so that's my path.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been
a great meditator.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I want to say, oh, yes, I am.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:90%
But I journal a lot.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: That's--

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For people
that aren't familiar,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
what is "A Course in Miracles"?

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: "A Course in Miracles"
is a spiritual psychotherapy

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
program that teaches you how to
live in love instead of fear.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a mind training
program that really--

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and again, because I
have such an active mind,

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
it worked for me
of that, it really

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
directs the right
use of your mind.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.163 align:middle line:84%
That at any minute, you could
be having a fearful thought,

00:28:29.163 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
or you could be having
a loving thought.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And so it's
a practice, like--

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of training towards
the loving thoughts?

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.375 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Exactly.

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:36.175 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Exactly.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And with all of this stuff
that we're talking about,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
like even when you said
about failure, it's like,

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
this is a practice
every single day.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.560 align:middle line:90%
People, I think again--

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
things I want people

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.338 align:middle line:84%
to know in all of my work
is that people think I'm

00:28:49.338 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:90%
going to beat that seven steps.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.277 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hire that
perfect coach, and that's it.

00:28:53.277 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I will never have to
deal with change again.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I will never have to
deal with my mind again.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Good luck on that.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
write about something

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:90%
called inspired self-dialogues.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are they?

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's a technique that is in
"Thriving Through Uncertainty,"

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's also on my website.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique I
use almost every day.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing for me.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a journaling technique,
and what it is is,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:90%
when your mind is crazy--

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I could never shut it up
in meditation long enough

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:90%
to get an answer.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The monkey mind.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in the inspired
self-dialogue,

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I'll write for my fear.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll write when I'm crazy.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.098 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm scared.

00:29:29.098 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
The check didn't come in.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to make money.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the fear de jure is.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And so--
and then I write back

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:84%
from this incredibly
loving voice.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
The most loving presence
I could possibly

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
ever imagine-- the
voice of your spirit,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:90%
the voice of your genius.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:10%
Some people find it helpful to
think in terms of, what would

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:10%
you say to your best
friend or to your child?

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
If your child or your best
friend was in pain or anxiety,

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
you would say something
loving and strong.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.107 align:middle line:84%
And so I write back
from that voice.

00:30:01.107 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a conversation,
because sometimes my voice

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:90%
will say, relax, dear one.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Blah, blah, blah--
whatever it's going to say.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be like,
I am not relaxed.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd better be a child of light.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
turn the lights off.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Well,
doesn't that make you bipolar?

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.272 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting here
saying I'm freaking out.

00:30:18.272 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, relax.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Relax.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Be calm.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
All the--

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I love that.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that true?

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So I love
that you said that.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
What I think it is is that we
have both voices in our mind.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
the fear and anxiety blocks

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:90%
your highest intelligence.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The fear and anxiety
blo-- even medical science

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:84%
says that it restricts
your blood chemistry.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it restricts
your thought flow.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're scared
and you're amped up,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
you don't have access
to your resourceful

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%
mind-- your creative ideas.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.827 align:middle line:84%
And so we do have two
voices in our mind.

00:30:50.827 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm always
trying to teach people--

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:90%
More than that.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah, at least.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
What I'm always
trying to teach people

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a higher
intelligence and a love that

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
can guide you through
anything, if you listen to it.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But you are listening
to that fear.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:90%
You're indulging that fear.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're giving
in the opportunity

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to hear another voice,
to have another opinion.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I like the
idea that you give

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
the best advice you possibly
could to a best friend.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.682 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or a child,
or a loved one.

00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Because you
speak differently to them

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:90%
than you do to yourself.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.267 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Why is that?

00:31:22.267 --> 00:31:23.955 align:middle line:84%
My best friend--
oh, you can do it.

00:31:23.955 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You can do it, honey.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I believe in you.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Me, not so much.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
also people, though,

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in your life that will
have other voices as well,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:90%
talking about other voices.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Where you hear
them in your head--

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
the voice of your mother
and the voice of--

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Actually, we have a--

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: That's
what therapy if for.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.562 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:38.562 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The voice
of your therapist.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES:

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.165 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gives you advice.

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:41.965 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm-hmm.

00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you know
what's the right advice?

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I think-- so I have a chapter in
"Thriving Through Uncertainty"

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that says, think twice
before you take advice.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Think twice before
you take advice.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.053 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Because everybody's
coming at you with advice.

00:31:56.053 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And especially if
you're shifting careers

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:84%
or you're an
entrepreneur and you're

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.885 align:middle line:84%
doing the life of
your dreams and

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
you get all this even business
advice and internet advice.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The main thing I would say is,
notice how it feels to you.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel when
you hear that advice?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
If that advice makes you feel
peaceful or hopeful or excited,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd listen to it.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:90%
If not, I wouldn't.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think the main
thing I want you to do

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.210 align:middle line:90%
is to start listening to your--

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I want you to listen to people,
but then filter it through.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, take for example
something like Facebook.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It changes all the time.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.640 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
making it better, and--

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]
It's very confuse--

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
to this idea and that.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should post
this way and do that.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you really filter
through all the noise?

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I think that is the
biggest thing we have to do.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.605 align:middle line:84%
I think that is the most
important thing we have to do.

00:32:44.605 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Filter
through the noise?

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Filter through
the noise, or stop

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:90%
listening to external advice.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Stop listening to
external advice, because we

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:90%
think the experts know.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want you on an original
path that no one has--

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.072 align:middle line:90%
no one knows your path.

00:33:00.072 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:90%
You haven't been here before.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
There's genius in you
that we don't know yet.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I spent so much time when I--
when my second book came out,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.058 align:middle line:84%
"Inspired and Unstoppable,"
worrying about, oh, Facebook.

00:33:10.058 --> 00:33:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And you should do this, and
you should do social media,

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and I should do that.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing this,
and I have to block.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:90%
But wait, I have to do this.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was making myself crazy,
instead of really following,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to do, Tam?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm a speaker.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm a speaker.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a writer.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%
That's where I belong.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't belong doing
every single thing.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And you're trying to
do everything right, instead

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%
of what's right for you.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And sometimes it
really does take focus,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and the people that really
do that on a marketing level

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.520 align:middle line:90%
are brilliant at it.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:90%
That's their genius.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And let them do that.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.095 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:40.095 --> 00:33:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah, that.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And also that again, there's
this belief system that there's

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.710 align:middle line:90%
a right way to do it.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I got a book published
in a way that everybody

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.832 align:middle line:90%
told me was crazy.

00:33:50.832 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Everybody told me, you
can't just write a book.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't just write it.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Self-published.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: You can't say,
oh, it's self-published

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and think it's going to
go somewhere-- whatever.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.095 align:middle line:84%
And I kept following
that inner voice.

00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes your
inner voice is

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
going to tell you something
different or alternative that

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:90%
is not what the experts say.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:84%
But again, I deeply
believe that we're here

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:90%
to be new answers in the world.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
fit into the world.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:90%
We're here to reshape the world.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:84%
We're here to make it
new with our answers,

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to come
from listening to our genius.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.781 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look here at
Tama talking about what she did

00:34:22.781 --> 00:34:23.989 align:middle line:90%
when things got really tough.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:24.789 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:26.020 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.750 align:middle line:10%
- I guess I wanted to start by
just asking a question to you.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:10%
Is it me, or has life
ratcheted up a notch?

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:90%
Or two or three, yeah.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, everyone
you know is going

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:84%
through some kind
of uncertainty,

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of difficulty.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.560 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of challenge.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're in
some kind of change.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's as though
the universe is saying,

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.550 align:middle line:10%
the grace period is now over.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:10%
The grace period is now over.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:10%
We've been studying this stuff.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:10%
We know this stuff.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:10%
You know you have
an inner voice.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:10%
You know you have
this love inside you.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:10%
Some of us know that there
is this power within us

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:10%
that we can believe
in, that we can

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:10%
tap at any single time in our--

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.490 align:middle line:10%
at any time.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to do that.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I think for me, one
of the things I'm learning

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is it's time to get out
of your head and be led.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It's time to get out of
your head and be led.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's time to-- because
if you feel as though--

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
but you're scared, or you
don't know what's going on,

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:84%
or what's supposed to
happen, or there's change,

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:84%
here's what I want you to know,
and here's our theme for today.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:90%
That path is already inside you.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:84%
There is an answer
already inside you,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's moment by
moment that we listen.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's really about listening.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It's really about learning
how to trust that voice.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:10%
So what I want to
talk about is, what

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:10%
stops us from
trusting that voice?

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:10%
We know this.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.930 align:middle line:10%
We affirm these things.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:10%
We say these things.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:10%
We believe in them.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:10%
What stops us from truly
trusting and listening

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:10%
to that voice?

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know about
you, but one thing I know

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:10%
is that if you're not listening
to the voice of your love

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.430 align:middle line:10%
and your heart and your
commitment and your dream

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.325 align:middle line:10%
and your power, then you are
listening to somebody else.

00:36:22.325 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And you're listening
to something else.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:10%
Because again, I deeply
believe we are living

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:10%
in wildly inspired times.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:10%
Are we not?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We are living in very, very
different, crazy times.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:10%
I believe they're
wildly inspired times,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.370 align:middle line:10%
and I believe it's
because we have wildly

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.070 align:middle line:10%
inspired answers in us.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's time to live that dream
or that mission or that gift

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:10%
that you have-- that thing
that someday you want to do.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:10%
That thing that you
always think about.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:10%
These are the times.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:10%
And so again, what
I was saying is,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:10%
if you're not
listening to yourself,

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.717 align:middle line:10%
who are you listening to?

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.300 align:middle line:10%
If you're not listening
to your heart,

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:10%
you're not listening
to your light,

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:10%
who are you listening to?

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Are you listening to
the voice of the media?

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you listening to
the voice of education?

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Are you listening to
the voice of a parent?

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:10%
If you know my story, I
was listening to my mother.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's who I was listening to.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.213 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:18.213 --> 00:37:19.013 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:19.013 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:84%
When we do have all those
different pieces of advice,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and especially people we
care about that we listen to,

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.328 align:middle line:84%
and we grew up
listening to, and--

00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: They're in
our bloodstream, and--

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the other thing I often
share with clients

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:84%
also is, I never take
advice from unhappy people.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I never take advice from
unhappy people, or people

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
who aren't living their dreams.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:84%
If they're not really lit
up in living their dreams,

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:90%
they may not know your path.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people in our lives,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:84%
like our relatives or
whatever, they mean well.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:90%
They are speaking with love.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
They want the best for you.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But they're speaking
with what they know.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, no one
knows your path.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't even know your path.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so you're
talking about doing

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:90%
a lot of self-guidance here.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.105 align:middle line:84%
And something that you talk
about in the book which

00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I like is, don't look
at what's falling apart.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at what's falling together.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm-hmm.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So most people look
at crisis as a dead end,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:90%
or there is no way out.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.025 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then we look three,
four months later saying,

00:38:16.025 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, it was the best
thing that ever happened.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: (LAUGHING) Exactly.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do we
train ourselves,

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in that moment of
crisis to say, this

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
is the best thing that
could ever happen?

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I wish we could.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I do.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I have th-- I remember
talking to a friend one time.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.432 align:middle line:84%
Somebody broke my
heart-- broke up with me.

00:38:32.432 --> 00:38:34.765 align:middle line:84%
And I remember talking to one
of my girlfriends, going--

00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:35.850 align:middle line:90%
[SNIFFS] you just watch.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.610 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
a freaking miracle.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.745 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:39.787 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did say that?

00:38:39.787 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So I knew
that intellectually,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and that's the thing.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of us know these
things intellectually.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We've read the self-help
books, or we've seen--

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:90%
we've watched "Oprah."

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We know these things
intellectually.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.595 align:middle line:84%
This is about
integrating it now.

00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:53.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:53.395 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: This is about
really embodying it now.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So I would never
want to put pressure

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:84%
on somebody who's in the
middle of something-- a crisis.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put pressure
on them to feel great.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Feel positive.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Feel whatever.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to create safety for
them to feel whatever they're

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.470 align:middle line:84%
feeling in that moment,
and to hold that awareness

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is
telling you this

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:84%
is the worst thing
that ever happened.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.460 align:middle line:90%
My life is over.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd want you to know
is, one form of your life

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:90%
may be over.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:90%
One expression might be over.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's so trite, but
it's like that caterpillar,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:90%
of the metamorphosis.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Of the caterpillar is
dying so that the butterfly

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
comes to life.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, yes.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's that, one door
closes and another one opens.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
lot of cliches here.

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Yeah, we could
do all cliches now.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:43.520 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, you said
the answer to how is yes.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm-hmm.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me what that means.

00:39:45.653 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So that's
a saying that--

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the author
Peter Block who said it.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I love it, because I
teach it all the time.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.178 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
that everybody's always

00:39:54.178 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out,
but how do I do this?

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: How do I this?

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
How do I get there?

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I say that all the time.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah, we all do.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:84%
We all want to
figure out the path.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm a
breadcrumb girl.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like the next step.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.120 align:middle line:90%
But the answer to how is yes.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is, most of us

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.630 align:middle line:84%
are trying to figure how to
get somewhere before we say yes

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:90%
to what we really want.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If I can see how to
get there, then I'll

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
say yes to what I want.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that this is a path of,

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
you say yes first.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then how?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.133 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: And then the how come.

00:40:25.133 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So the example I use,
actually, is if, god forbid,

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
a mother saw her child
pinned under a bus,

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:84%
she's not standing
there going, I wonder

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:90%
how I'm going to do this.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.893 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And will my
health insurance cover this,

00:40:38.893 --> 00:40:39.755 align:middle line:90%
and can I li--

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:90%
she's not doing that.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:84%
She's like, I am going
to get my kid free.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:43.840 align:middle line:90%
That's all she knows.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:84%
She's saying yes,
and the how comes.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Supernatural strength comes.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, at the same
time-- so you say yes,

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
but then you do
need the roadmap.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.380 align:middle line:90%
You do need the how.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.808 align:middle line:84%
So after you have
an accident, you

00:40:54.808 --> 00:40:56.350 align:middle line:84%
say yes, I'm going
to heal from this.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes when you start recovering.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Now what am I going to do
about getting a new car?

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to-- how am I
going to-- how am I going to--

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to your point about
the roadmap, is that I don't--

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
again, I'm always talking
about an inspired life, not

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.510 align:middle line:90%
a linear life.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a linear life
where you can plan it all out

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and map it all out,
that's a valid life.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a smaller life,
because what you can see

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and what you can imagine
is again, sometimes

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:90%
denying yourself something.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And so for an inspired
life, it doesn't work

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:90%
through planning it all out.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's going to wor--

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Everybody's
looking for answers.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.028 align:middle line:90%
And what I always tell them--

00:41:32.028 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
don't look for answers
for your whole life.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:90%
That's just too much.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.366 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:41:36.366 --> 00:41:38.074 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: What I want
you to look for is,

00:41:38.074 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:90%
what's my next step?

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.843 align:middle line:90%
What's my next step?

00:41:39.843 --> 00:41:40.643 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:40.643 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: What's my next step?

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we
do tend to go so far.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Oh, god.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, if this
happens, then that.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Then this, then that.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Then this is going to wind
up, and then I'm dead.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: I call that
playing mental chess.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, if they do this, I do that.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.520 align:middle line:90%
I do this.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're planning with what we
know, or what we think we know.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And life is
so much bigger and more

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:90%
amazing than what we can know.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I get caught
with this all the time.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I try to predict the future--

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Oh, yeah.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --or what's
going to happen.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] And my husband
says this me all the time.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:90%
You're mind reading, you know?

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And I'm like, I am?

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's-- I go into that
default where I try to see it,

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.240 align:middle line:84%
because I'm visual,
and if I don't see it,

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't figure it out first.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It goes out to--

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:90%
this table.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:84%
There's only this table, because
I'm going to imagine it first.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I need to imagine it first
in order for it to happen.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But leaping right into
it happening isn't my lead.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:31.966 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm-hmm.

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:32.766 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:42:32.766 --> 00:42:34.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so how would
you coach me if I say,

00:42:34.893 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I don't know
how to figure this out.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:90%
But I know what I want.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you
just say, imagine it?

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So I think
the first thing is,

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.397 align:middle line:90%
I want to get you feeling it.

00:42:44.397 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to get you
in the desire of it.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.438 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What that
feels like, yeah.

00:42:47.438 --> 00:42:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Because again,
most people immediately

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
start off with, I want a
really successful business.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they
immediately go into,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.522 align:middle line:84%
oh, but my finances
are a mess, and I

00:42:58.522 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to get a loan.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can't do this,
and I can't do that.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately start
focusing on the obstacles.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to get you
focused on the desire.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.237 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you tell
me more about what you want,

00:43:08.237 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and more about what you
want, so that you're

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.520 align:middle line:90%
in the feeling of it.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And from that feeling, we're
going to come up with, OK,

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
what would feel
good as a next step?

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.310 align:middle line:84%
What would feel good as
a-- to approach this?

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So go after
the why you want it

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and the bigger purpose
connected to it.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And the how fun it
would be, and how amaz--

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:90%
what if it could work?

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fun.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:90%
What if it could work?

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Like I always have to remember,
because I still fall into this.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm preparing for a
seminar or something like--

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and my mind's going--

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll be flying.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll be flying there.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- part of my
brain is going, well,

00:43:39.672 --> 00:43:41.365 align:middle line:84%
it's international,
so if you screw up,

00:43:41.365 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you never have to
go there again.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So that's my inner
self-doubt going, if you really

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.000 align:middle line:84%
mess this up, you never have
to go to that country again.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but I have to
change that self-talk to,

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.275 align:middle line:90%
what if it was phenomenal?

00:43:55.275 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:90%
What if it was great?

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:90%
How would that feel?

00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:58.820 align:middle line:90%
How exciting would that be?

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That more people are
now doing their dreams

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and using their gifts
and being extraordinary.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
What would that
feel-- so it helps

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.170 align:middle line:90%
me get into that feeling of it.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And from that feeling, I
can accomplish anything.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.058 align:middle line:90%
And I will know a next step.

00:44:11.058 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you still have
negative self-talk too.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: [SCOFFS] Yeah.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how you write
the books, right?

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: That's why
I'm a great teacher.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Because again,
because of I think that again,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I think this--

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to grow
for the rest of your life,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to
dinner or something new,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:84%
if you are going
to stay inspired,

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
you're always
going to your edge.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
your edge, you're

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.340 align:middle line:90%
always going to face fear.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't trust
experts that say, oh, I

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:90%
don't have any fears ever.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, then
you're not alive.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It is--

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: They're not alive.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's part of life.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.902 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
we can reverse engineer

00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, well, I'm just
never going to have fear again,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and really live in this place
of total, complete peace.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Right.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I think it's--

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's there for a reason.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: It is
there for a reason.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And my fear has made me dig
deeper into my spirituality,

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and make me dig deeper
into my real beliefs,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and what I will commit
to in this lifetime.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't let me be casual.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: It doesn't
let me coast.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, the one thing I
will say that I have from it,

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
though, is you start having a
track record of having trusted

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.130 align:middle line:84%
your inner voice
and your instincts,

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.152 align:middle line:90%
and that it did work.

00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't go bankrupt,
and you're not eating cat food.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:23.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And no one you
love is eating cat food--

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:90%
except your cats.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then it eventually
works out, and have a track

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.240 align:middle line:90%
record of it working out.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yeah.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So at least I have that
sanity now to say, OK, Tam,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.750 align:middle line:90%
you're scared out of your mind.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
You're telling
yourself scary stories.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But you know these
principles work.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:90%
You know they work.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have no idea
how it's going to work,

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.620 align:middle line:90%
but it has worked in the past.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Always.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's why
you are where you are.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.370 align:middle line:90%

again, I don't map it out,

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.980 align:middle line:84%

we're going someplace

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.960 align:middle line:90%
we never thought we'd go.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.900 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I speak

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:90%

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.690 align:middle line:84%

Let's take a look at
Tama we're talking

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.240 align:middle line:84%
about the voices in our head and
the stories we tell ourselves.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.410 align:middle line:84%
- So I'll give you an
example of how stories work.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my good examples.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:84%
When I met my partner
many, many years ago--

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Paul, who's back there--

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and we met at a conference
many, many years ago.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And we were at this conference,
and we're walking together.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm relaxed,
I'm just chirping away.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, [CHIRPING AWAY]
yakking away.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And he's very quiet.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.440 align:middle line:90%
So he's very quiet.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And so my immediate
thought was like, ooh,

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:90%
he's a good listener.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:90%
This is going to work.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's my first thought.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.350 align:middle line:90%
That's great, right?

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Then I start-- you know how
you start hitting something,

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and some fear starts coming in?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, this
fear starts coming in of--

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS] maybe I'm boring him.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.565 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm boring
him into a stupor.

00:47:42.565 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second
thought that comes in.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And then all the crap from my
past, like past boyfriends,

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and past relationships
start coming to my brain.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Like, you're so intense.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.600 align:middle line:90%
You're so intense.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm having this
conversation in my head now.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Like, I am not that intense.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I am not.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just having
this thing, and it's like--

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking,
I'm not that intense.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I could
do better than this.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.777 align:middle line:90%
I really could.

00:48:14.777 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:84%
While all Paul is
done has been quiet.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.568 align:middle line:90%
That is all that is going on.

00:48:17.568 --> 00:48:19.300 align:middle line:90%
The man has not said a word--

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.310 align:middle line:90%
not said a word.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm immediately-- now I am
judging the hell out of him,

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm thinking, I
could do bet-- you know,

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:90%
he's not even that good looking.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I could do better.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through this
whole thing in my head.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:84%
All that has happened in reality
is he hasn't said a word.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I have gone all over the place.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank god-- thank god in
that particular moment

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I had the wisdom or presence
of mind to actually ask him

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.570 align:middle line:84%
what was going on, instead of
having this war in my head.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had just said, well,
I noticed that you're quiet.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that you're quiet,
and I'm just wondering,

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:90%
is something going on?

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And he was really sweet.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, to be
honest with you, I'm nervous.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You're a beautiful woman,
and you're intelligent,

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a little nervous.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.526 align:middle line:90%

Oh!

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:90%

>>KIEVES: And it's like, I want
this to be more self-loving.

00:51:01.915 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be something that
you have permission always

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to just start right now to
choose again, and to not worry

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:84%
about being linear or staying
with the one commitment

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:84%
you set, but maybe the higher
commitment, and the higher

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.960 align:middle line:84%
goal, and to have
that experimentation.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard the
phrase of making your life

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.480 align:middle line:90%
unrecognizable.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Mm.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that idea of being
unfaithful to what you thought

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.220 align:middle line:84%
was so true, and changing it
so that It looks so radically

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.050 align:middle line:90%
different, but in a good way.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.713 align:middle line:84%
In a good way, you're
following again.

00:51:32.713 --> 00:51:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Because again, everybody
has their advice.

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:37.900 align:middle line:84%
When I started writing, I joined
some writers' support group.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had some
curmudgeonly old man

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that told me, if you
really want to be a writer,

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to write
every single day.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And I panicked because I wasn't
writing every single day,

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't doing it right.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I've still never written
every single day.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I just--

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.292 align:middle line:84%
I think that you have to
find your own chemistry

00:51:54.292 --> 00:51:55.125 align:middle line:90%
and your own rhythm.

00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:55.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:55.925 --> 00:51:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And you have to have
that experimentation to do it.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about something
called a Win List.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.680 align:middle line:90%
What is a Win List?

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: So Win List
is a technique I use.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's in my
books, and it's also

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.720 align:middle line:90%
on my website, tamakieves.com.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's a technique
I use with my clients.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:16.423 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is, many of us
who are in uncertainty of--

00:52:16.423 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you're doing
your own business.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is racing and racing
about all you haven't done,

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.800 align:middle line:84%
all you haven't accomplished,
how you're not making progress,

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.175 align:middle line:84%
how you're not
getting there, how

00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:84%
you're cellulite is making
progress, but you're not.

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And so--

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.808 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:29.808 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: The Win
List is a technique

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:35.190 align:middle line:84%
where I ask you to write maybe
five to 10 wins each day.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And what a win is is some
kind of progress-- some kind

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of forward movement.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And some of it can be
external, like, OK, I

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.320 align:middle line:84%
called that person I was
supposed to call today.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm even
more interested

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:50.760 align:middle line:84%
in is internal
progress-- the things

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:84%
you might normally
never recognize.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.380 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'm
usually depressed

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:90%
for 30 minutes when I wake up.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:00.395 align:middle line:84%
But today, I was
depressed for 29 minutes.

00:53:00.395 --> 00:53:01.770 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
go on a Win List.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And again, you might think--

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.600 align:middle line:84%
most of us are so linear, we
think, oh, that's not progress.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But on this kind of
journey, it's all internal.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's the internal shifts.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to have
people credit themselves

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:90%
for the things they are doing.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had the courage to
tell my husband the truth.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.572 align:middle line:84%
I backed down in the middle
of it, but at least I started.

00:53:22.572 --> 00:53:23.780 align:middle line:90%
So that goes on the Win List.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.578 align:middle line:84%

>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or that you
went to do something

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that you usually
have as a habit,

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and you just stop
for a few minutes.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.225 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like eating chocolate
cake or something like that.

00:53:38.225 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Perfect.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I was conscious.

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I still caved, but I
was conscious this time.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So does it
help you actually

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.602 align:middle line:90%
get rid of the bad habit?

00:53:45.602 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes, it does.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're doing is
you're building the self-love,

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're building
the sense of progress.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And bad habits come
from bad self-talk.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.455 align:middle line:84%
Bad habits come from,
I feel like a loser.

00:53:56.455 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm never
getting anywhere.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Only chocolate cake is
going to save me now.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.162 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: But if I'm feeling
like, yeah, I am doing it.

00:54:03.162 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I am getting better.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I did
stand up for myself.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I did apply this.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about a Win List

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is, sometimes what goes
on it is a moment when

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.410 align:middle line:84%
you felt connected
to maybe the universe

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.870 align:middle line:90%
or spirit or something.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Where all of a sudden you
had that thought and somebody

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.000 align:middle line:90%
called to you.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.958 align:middle line:84%
So you feel like, oh,
maybe I'm not alone here.

00:54:19.958 --> 00:54:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is a higher plan.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where do you keep this?

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:23.122 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere visible?

00:54:23.122 --> 00:54:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something that you--

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.538 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: That's a cool idea.

00:54:25.538 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I just journal it on anything.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.845 align:middle line:84%
When I'm a nut,
anything will do.

00:54:28.845 --> 00:54:29.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you help
people with writing books?

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you help them with talks?

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.395 align:middle line:90%
What do you help them with?

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyth-- really, what
my dearest thing is,

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I am here to help people
become the extraordinary selves

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:40.960 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I help artists and
entrepreneurs and visionaries

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:84%
to really realize their highest
dream, whatever that is.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And so sometimes it is help--

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I've helped a lot of people--

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.880 align:middle line:90%
I do book coaching.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.680 align:middle line:90%

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:84%

>>KIEVES: Just off
the top of my head,

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about a client who
is also an author, who did not

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.513 align:middle line:90%
think she could write, ever.

00:55:17.513 --> 00:55:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Who did not think
she could write.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And she was a very
gifted psychotherapist,

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to
have a book out there.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And she kept hiring all
these ghost writers.

oh, they became a ghost.

00:55:32.935 --> 00:55:34.044 align:middle line:90%

>>KIEVES: That's a
real ghost writer now.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But the point was, she
never believed she could

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:40.650 align:middle line:90%
write or tell her own story.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And I kept bugging her.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.130 align:middle line:90%

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I never have an
answer for someone.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the answer is.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I know how to find it.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You empower them to
find it within themselves.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Exactly.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there is a love
or an inspiration or something

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that's speaking to that person,
and I'm following energy.

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll follow-- I always follow
that inspired self in somebody.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you just
light it up for them.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, we
don't really have

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:24.680 align:middle line:84%
people like that
in our lives that

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.760 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a constant
coaching cheerleader.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I am
a witness to that.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote all of my
books to be the same thing,

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.670 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody can
afford coaching, right?

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: And so I
wanted all of my books

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to be like this coach in
your pocket that-- and people

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:90%
tell me that.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That it's on their bed
stand, or they read it

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:middle line:84%
in the mornings,
of just something

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that, I'm going to
remind you consistently

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.140 align:middle line:84%
how amazing you are, and
how extraordinary you

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:90%
are, and don't settle.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.697 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do people
forget that that much?

00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Every day.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Every minute.

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: I do.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this and I do,
because fear is so powerful,

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and it takes over, and
we live in a culture

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.512 align:middle line:84%
that we leave this
interview, and we're not

00:57:05.512 --> 00:57:07.637 align:middle line:84%
going to be hearing interviews
that are telling you

00:57:07.637 --> 00:57:08.593 align:middle line:90%
you're extraordinary.

00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, we're not.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: We're going
to be listening--

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.800 align:middle line:90%
you'd better be careful.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And this and that,
and this and that.

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.083 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's wrong with you?

00:57:13.083 --> 00:57:13.270 align:middle line:90%
How come--

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:14.603 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: What's wrong with you.

00:57:14.603 --> 00:57:15.650 align:middle line:90%
How to fix you.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I think
we need these voices.

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.575 align:middle line:84%
It's my life's work,
is that I really

00:57:20.575 --> 00:57:22.950 align:middle line:84%
want to be this voice in the
world that will consistently

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:84%
remind you of how
unparalleled you are.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.873 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
somebody's cheerleader.

00:57:26.873 --> 00:57:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You're really not going to
get that from your-- even

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.082 align:middle line:84%
the people that love you
the most, because they--

00:57:31.082 --> 00:57:32.820 align:middle line:84%
as well-intentioned
as they may be,

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.760 align:middle line:84%
they have a way of
saying it from--

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Nagging.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good word.

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: Let's
just say what it is.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:38.351 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:39.768 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's just
say what it is.

00:57:39.768 --> 00:57:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So you've explained
this a little bit.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the overall
picture of things,

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.450 align:middle line:90%
what is your biggest why?

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: My biggest why?

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.570 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.190 align:middle line:90%
My biggest why, I think--

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I always say that on my watch,
I don't want somebody giving up

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:57.330 align:middle line:90%
on what they could have been.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:58.560 align:middle line:90%
I know my own life.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.210 align:middle line:10%
I know how unhappy and
how scared I've been,

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:06.360 align:middle line:10%
and how many times I
have quit or almost

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.810 align:middle line:10%
quit this path, and the
life I would have missed,

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:12.570 align:middle line:10%
and the people I've touched,
and the journeys I've had

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:13.927 align:middle line:10%
and continue to have.

00:58:13.927 --> 00:58:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I would have missed that, and
I don't want somebody else

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.550 align:middle line:90%
to miss their life.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I deeply believe that there
are inventors out there right

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.220 align:middle line:84%
now, or entrepreneurs,
or healers, or artists,

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:27.240 align:middle line:84%
or leaders, or corporate leaders
that have brilliant ideas--

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.190 align:middle line:84%
or doctors, or health
practitioners that

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.530 align:middle line:90%
have something unconventional.

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And on my watch, as
long as I'm alive,

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.662 align:middle line:84%
I want to empower that for them
to trust what's inside them,

00:58:38.662 --> 00:58:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and to go to that next level.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I deeply believe they
have genius to give this world,

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:90%
and I want them to give it.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To show it back to them.

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to find
out themselves.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And also, finding
it yourself, or myself,

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.783 align:middle line:84%
if you're the coach, is
so much more impactful

00:58:52.783 --> 00:58:55.200 align:middle line:84%
than someone else saying, you
need to do this, this, this,

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.026 align:middle line:90%
and five steps to this.

00:58:56.026 --> 00:58:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: It doesn't work.

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KIEVES: You will not stay
with somebody else's steps.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You will only stay
with your own,

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.750 align:middle line:90%
because you need to be moved.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for showing us

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:07.710 align:middle line:84%
what it means to thrive
through uncertainty.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like really just
to find that inner inspiration,

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and that helps you
get through anything.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KIEVES: Yes.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for the work you do.

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.650 align:middle line:90%

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:17.610 align:middle line:90%
