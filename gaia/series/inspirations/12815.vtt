00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm
Lisa Garr, and welcome.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to be talking
about stress specifically

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.995 align:middle line:90%
and how to reduce it.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be talking
about that by understanding

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
the scientific connection
between the heart

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today
is Howard Martin.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
He is the vice
president of HearthMath

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.995 align:middle line:84%
and also the co-author of
"The Heartmath Solution."

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And he is also on the
Global Steering Committee

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
of the Global
Coherence Initiative.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.494 align:middle line:90%
So welcome to the show.

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining me.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD MARTIN: Lisa,
thank you so much.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here with you today.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great to have you.

00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So HeartMath has gained a lot
of recognition in the industry,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and it is a very
reputable organization.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Tell our listeners about what
it is and what exactly do you

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.785 align:middle line:90%
do there?

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
thanks for asking.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm very proud of what's been
accomplished in these 20 years

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.596 align:middle line:90%
with HearthMath.

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
This year is our
20th anniversary.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 20 years.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Time
has really flown--

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Since we started
HeartMath back in 1991.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
What HeartMath is, really,
is a system consisting

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.357 align:middle line:84%
of methods, techniques,
and technology,

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:21.065 align:middle line:84%
all underpinned with
scientific research,

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the things that
sort of makes us just a little

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's been designed
very carefully

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to help empower people during
these changing times we all

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:90%
live in.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The system was created
by Doc Childre, who's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
been my long-time friend
for many, many years now,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
who really started
and created HeartMath.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.974 align:middle line:84%
And he's the chairman of
all the organizations today.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why an
organization like HeartMath?

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Why does it exist?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the need that
it is fulfilling?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
back when we first

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
started HeartMath it
was born from care,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
really, Doc's care and
my care and others' that

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%
were associated with it.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We had gone through a lot
of periods in our lives

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
where we had done what we could
to improve ourselves as people.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.754 align:middle line:84%
It was not an
ambition-driven start for us.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
It was not the
kind of thing where

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we've got a great
idea now and we

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.201 align:middle line:84%
have to go out and
share it with the world.

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.112 align:middle line:84%
It had a maturation
process to it.

00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, we felt
that the caring thing to do

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.653 align:middle line:84%
would be to share whatever
we had gained, whatever

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%
we had learned with others.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But yet, in our society
today, through the roar

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.889 align:middle line:84%
of ambition and survival, we
often end up living neck up--

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --as we do, stress.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and
how this relates.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So now, in
understanding stress--

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm loving this conversation
today because not only

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
how to reduce stress,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but how to go from stressed
to a place of coherence, which

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:90%
is, as you explain, different.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.875 align:middle line:90%
It's different than relaxation.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sure.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a different state.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Let's talk
about stress for a minute.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Not necessarily
the most scintillating topic

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:90%
that people want to hear about.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a very
important topic, yes.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.276 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It is.

00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
But stress is something
that most people experience

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.962 align:middle line:84%
today in-- at levels that
haven't experienced it before.

00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
The changes occurring in
our world, the changes

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.729 align:middle line:84%
in our personal lives, all
that can be very disconcerting.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.145 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're living
in an era that's

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
going through such a
high-speed period of change.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Very, very stressful,
statistically

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
it bears all that out.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Stress is debilitating.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
When we experience
too much stress,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84%
it has a big impact on our
health, negative impact.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It robs us of the
quality of life.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Many things come from
having too much stress.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to
break that down

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
into two different things,
two different types of stress.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.935 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sure.

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The stress
that comes from outside

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.267 align:middle line:84%
in, where people are
losing their homes,

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
they're being laid
off from their jobs

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
right before holidays, they're
experiencing an enormous amount

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
because of our
economy and situations

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%
that are happening in our media.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It seems to really label and
emphasize a lot of stress

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's one type of stress.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.778 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
the chemical reactions

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that happen in the body
when stress occurs--

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the cortisol release, the fight
or flight-- all of those things

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that break the
immune system down.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's the external
stress and then

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:90%
there's the internal stress.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And the
effect of stress

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that happens
internally in our body.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.901 align:middle line:84%
People think about the external
things as their stress--

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
losing the home, losing the
job, those kind of things.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.747 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, those
events are stressful.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's a given.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But researchers for
years used to do,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
even the earliest research
on stress-- Hans Selye

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
and these different people that
were doing research on stress--

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
said that stress
was not the events,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
it was the perception
of the events.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.824 align:middle line:84%
We were perceiving the
event in a certain way

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:26.255 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
it was stressful.

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
What we've learned at HeartMath,
at the Institute of HeartMath,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.775 align:middle line:84%
and what I've
learned personally is

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the
perception of the events,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.315 align:middle line:84%
it's what happens emotionally
when we have that perception.

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The emotions are really where
the stress is being registered.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience strong
negative emotions, like anxiety

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
or frustration or anger or
disappointment, those kind

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of emotions, a lot goes on
in the body that's not good.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned hormones--
it releases hormones

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
into our system that
are not good for us

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.728 align:middle line:84%
when they are there
in excessive amounts.

00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
No hormone is bad, but it's
about the hormone relationships

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and balances.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Too much cortisol, for example.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is generically
known as the stress hormone--

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Stress
hormone, right, uh-huh.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.889 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Too much cortisol
does a lot of things

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.469 align:middle line:84%
to our physical
body we don't want.

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Too much adrenaline--
the same thing.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.218 align:middle line:84%
And these are both hormones
that are directly related

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to the stress response.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
To understand how to
better regulate stress,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn how to better
regulate emotional responses.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So to manage the
stress response to that is not

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
as much important
to say we're not

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
going to have those
feelings; it's

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
what do we do with
them when we have them.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
How fast can we move
out of those emotions

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
into something that's
at least neutralized

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
those negative feelings or
possibly transformed them

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
into something else that's
regenerative and positive.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And one
of the big topics

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.595 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be talking
about today is resilience

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.352 align:middle line:84%
and how to deal with it, why
we-- big factors in stress.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But I want to back
up for a minute,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:84%
because in the beginning I
talked about we are going

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to be understanding the
scientific connection

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.714 align:middle line:90%
between the heart and the brain.

00:05:58.714 --> 00:05:59.338 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sure.

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Today we know that
the heart actually

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
communicates with the brain and
the rest of the body in four

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
distinct ways.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:90%
The first way is neurologically.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
In your heart and my heart,
and everyone's heart,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a complex
nervous system.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It's studied through a field
called neurocardiology.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.999 align:middle line:84%
Those guys actually call
it the brain in the heart.

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The brain in the heart?

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: In the heart, yeah.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sophisticated
nervous system

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
found in our heart, communicates
with the big brain in the head.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It does it through
a nerve pathway

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that starts in the heart
and travels upward.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I never knew this.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It comes in through the
lower brain centers,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it goes right in through
the limbic system,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
which is where the emotional
centers of the brain are.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But then, where it
gets interesting

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
is it terminates all the
way in the neocortex.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The higher perceptual
thinking part of our brain

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.854 align:middle line:84%
is getting information
from our heart.

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most think that it goes
from the brain to the heart--

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Correct.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --as opposed
to the opposite, OK.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah,
with the information

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.133 align:middle line:84%
going from the brain
down to the heart

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is simply controlling the
timing of the heartbeat.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
When you map out neurological
traffic in the body,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
it's clearly seen that
the heart is actually

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.275 align:middle line:84%
sending a lot more
information to the brain

00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
than it ever receives
from the brain.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one way
the heart's communicating.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It does it through something
called a blood pressure wave.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
When we put our hand on our
wrist, we feel their pulse,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a wave
of energy created

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
by the squeezing
of the heart that's

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
pushing the blood
through the body.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
That blood pressure
wave modulates

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the body's systems.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Brain wave activity,
for example,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is synchronized
to changes taking

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
place in the blood
pressure wave.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.797 align:middle line:84%
That's called a
biophysical communication.

00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.421 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There's
another fascinating fact.

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
This is another one,
who knew, right?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
1983, all the way
back then, the heart

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
was actually classified as
part of our hormonal system.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It produces hormones.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.866 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, interesting.

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Nobody knew this.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.269 align:middle line:84%
So there's hormones like
atrial peptide and oxytocin

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that are being
produced by the heart.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.768 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From the heart?

00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So there's a
biochemical conversation

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
happening as well.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, these freeways, Lisa,
are all biological-- hardwired

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:90%
biological processes.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Definitively, without
a doubt showing

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is doing
more than pumping blood.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But where it gets interesting
for me is the fourth way.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts are
electrical organs.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.386 align:middle line:84%
They're energy-producing
organ in our body.

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
a doctor measures

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.187 align:middle line:84%
is that energy, when
we get our ECG or EKG.

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
They're measuring
an electrical signal

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
being produced by the
beating of the heart.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, that signal is strong.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the strongest source of
bioelectricity in our body,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:84%
40 to 60 times stronger than
the second most powerful source,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.412 align:middle line:90%
which is the brain.

00:08:34.412 --> 00:08:35.197 align:middle line:90%
40 to 60 times.

00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
so it is actually

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
emitting a stronger
signal than the brain.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: 40 to
60 times stronger.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.142 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 40 to 60 times stronger.

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now, that signal--
the electrical energy

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
from that signal goes to
every single cell in our body,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and it permeates
every single cell.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Here's where it
gets interesting.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It creates an electromagnetic
field of energy

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds you and me--

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The body?

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --in 360 degrees,
extending beyond the skin

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:90%
out into space.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.992 align:middle line:84%
In the book "The
HeartMath Solution"

00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had the
privilege of writing

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
with Doc Childre, the
HeartMath founder,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.321 align:middle line:84%
we reported on another
clinic's finding

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that said they measured it 8
to 10 feet outside of the body.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Our researchers
say they can reliably

00:09:14.378 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
stand behind 3 to 4 feet.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.056 align:middle line:90%
So we have these fields.

00:09:18.056 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you measure?

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.937 align:middle line:84%
So our body has an
electrical system

00:09:20.937 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's going through the 3
trillion cells in the body,

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and then that emanates out into
something called a human energy

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:90%
field?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's energy field.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not an aura; it's
not subtle energy.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's electromagnetic energy
we're measuring in this case.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so if somebody
walks in the room who is angry,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that,
it's an actual field?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.755 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's one
possible explanation.

00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
The field changes.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
field goes-- it's

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
radiating out or
broadcasting out.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.660 align:middle line:84%
The energy in the field,
the frequency, so to speak,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.076 align:middle line:84%
in the field will
change depending

00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:52.089 align:middle line:84%
upon what emotional
state we're in.

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling
anger, for example,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.849 align:middle line:84%
or frustrated, or
nervous, or whatever;

00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
it's usually producing what's
called an incoherent spectrum--

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of frequencies
inharmoniously trying

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:90%
to exist in the same place.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When we switch
the emotional state

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to feel emotions
that are associated with heart,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like, let's say, deep care for
someone or something or love,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
or appreciation for,
hey, life is good,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that field will change
and becomes more ordered.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
coherent spectrum.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we are literally
broadcasting our emotions out

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:90%
in the space through this field.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the anger
and the frustration

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
is more of a frenetic; the
love, the appreciation,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
the gratitude is more coherent?

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the field
that literally you feel?

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so we may
feel that from someone.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:90%
That's one explanation--

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.529 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --for why are
we can walk into a room,

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
we see two people,
they look normal,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
but yet we don't feel
that something's right.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.106 align:middle line:84%
And we ask them if
there's anything going on,

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
we find out they've been having
an argument, for example.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.328 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This not saying
scientifically definitively

00:10:53.328 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that that's why
we understand it,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.305 align:middle line:84%
but it's one way we may
be able to explain it.

00:10:58.305 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Here's why.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
When we go to this understanding
of heart communication,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.195 align:middle line:84%
now we're out of just biology,
now we're into physics.

00:11:06.195 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:90%
We're in the energy fields.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:84%
How does this field relate
to the field in our brain?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.567 align:middle line:84%
How does my field
and your field,

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
how are our fields
relating to one another--

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.149 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right now.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --right now.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And then where we've
gone with it now

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and where we'll talk about
some more in our dialogue today

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is how does the field produced
by my heart and the field

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
collectively of humanity
relate to one another?

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And then how do those fields
relate to the energy fields

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
produced by the
planet, the Earth

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
itself, that whole
energetic connection.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The micro
to the macro, yes.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it goes
beyond what you

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
see when you get on a treadmill
and you put your little thumb

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.905 align:middle line:84%
in the thing, and you
see your heart rate

00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:43.229 align:middle line:84%
and how fast it's beating
when you're on the treadmill,

00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It goes beyond what the
doctor shows you in an EKG.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It goes beyond all of those
just parts of evidence.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:84%
This is something that goes
into the human energy field

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's centered in the
heart and sends a message

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.107 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It becomes a really
interesting thought process

00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of how do we relate as human
beings to something larger.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is playing the
central role in all of that.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.525 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's important
is that heart and brain are not

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
in competition;
they work together.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard-wired system.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But we've somehow believed
that all intelligence is only

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.397 align:middle line:90%
happening in our brain.

00:12:24.397 --> 00:12:26.105 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe
from my own experience

00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
is that the brain is a master
interpreter of information,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that it sorts, compares,
compartmentalizes,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
tries to make sense out of
information that it receives.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.615 align:middle line:84%
But is not the only source of
where we get intelligence from.

00:12:38.615 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk about some of
the specific causes of stress.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.894 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned to me that
there's two causes of stress.

00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Most of
the surveys show

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
that either number
one or number two

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to be one
of these two things.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.114 align:middle line:84%
One is the feeling of
not having enough time.

00:12:53.114 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The feeling of
not having enough time?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Constantly being rushed?

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
any of that's brought

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
on by the information and
the technology age, and--

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.027 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean everything is
so instantaneous and designed

00:13:04.027 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
to be more convenient, more
convenient, more convenient,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:90%
so you can do more in less time.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, we're actually
getting more information

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:90%
than we were designed to get.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Our physiology hasn't
even caught up yet

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.025 align:middle line:84%
with being able to absorb
that much information.

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we stay dialed
in and wired and connected

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:90%
to everything all the time--

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.416 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --and
that's part of it,

00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
certainly, the feeling
of not have enough time.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But we also-- time is
actually, in a sense,

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:90%
speeding up as well.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
More events are happening in a
space of time than ever before.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.802 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling that people
are having about not

00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
having enough time or about
the overwhelm of it all--

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that documented?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.325 align:middle line:90%
Is that really documented?

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I don't know if it'd
be documented in a totally

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
empirical way, but,
certainly, I think,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.307 align:middle line:84%
if you step back and
think about your own life,

00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:90%
are more things happening?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel more things going
on than you ever have, right?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely, but I
don't know if it's just me

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or if it's just what
people are talking about.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it really--

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, it's
pretty much universal

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in my experience of asking
people what they feel and about

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
do they feel like things are
speeding up in their life.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've played with that
in some of my experiments.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I might be in a cab with
a cabdriver taking me

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
from the airport and
I'll say, do you ever

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
think your life's getting
faster than it was before?

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And I get 100% yes
back every time

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.472 align:middle line:90%
when I ask questions like that.

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm not
sure you could ever

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
quantify that and
double-blind study it.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I don't know if
we need to quantify it.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Review it.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: People are
actually experiencing

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.587 align:middle line:90%
that in their own life.

00:14:27.587 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's that feeling of
not having enough time,

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
too much to do, not enough time,
the overwhelmed feeling that's

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
one of the primary causes of
stress, usually number one

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:90%
or two in a stress survey.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.797 align:middle line:84%
The second cause is feeling
that you're not in control.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's a person, let's say--

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
don't have choice.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You don't have choice.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:44.964 align:middle line:90%
You're in job.

00:14:44.964 --> 00:14:46.255 align:middle line:90%
Your boss tells you what to do.

00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything about it.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a feeling that creates
a tremendous amount of stress.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
You're locked into situations in
life that you can't get out of.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.445 align:middle line:90%
You're doomed.

00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:90%
You have no choice.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
You're going through these
feelings of resignation

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and disappointment that leads to
these very stressful feelings--

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
they're sadness and depression
feelings, and things like that.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They're all part of
what stress really is.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
right, of course.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.309 align:middle line:84%
And then the cardiologists
will always tell you,

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:12.704 align:middle line:90%
you need to reduce your stress.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And change your diet.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So this can all be fixed
through stress and diet.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And you walk out of there
going stress and diet, what

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:90%
do I do about that?

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly, yeah.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So exactly how
do you reduce the stress?

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, that's
where HeartMath comes in.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And we do lots of different
kinds of training programs,

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
resilience-based training,
performance improvement

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:84%
training, personal growth
training through our Heart

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Mastery program that we have.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things
that we do in there.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.226 align:middle line:84%
Stress is usually somewhere
in that training process

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to begin to look
at that and deal

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
with it, because,
again, we want to be

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:84%
able to remove some the things
that stand in our way of having

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
these fulfilling
and meaningful lives

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and contributing to this
change we're experiencing

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:90%
in the world in a dynamic way.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:90%
We have to get the blocks out.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.921 align:middle line:90%
So we do focus on that some.

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But see, there's a
state that we can

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
enter into that's measurable
by looking at heart,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
again, that sort
of offsets stress

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
could be looked at almost in a
way as an antidote to stress.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a state
called coherence.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a medical term for it--
psychophysiological coherence.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That's a mouthful for
a southerner to say,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:90%
but it's a long word.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Psychophysiological coherence.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And coherence is a
highly-ordered state

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
physiologically, when
all of our body systems

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%
are working together.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
They are synchronizing
to changes in our heart.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the heart, it's

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
the master rhythm
maker in the body.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It's setting the tempo; it's
setting the tone for everything

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
that's happening internally.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
All the other system synchronize
to heart-- respiration,

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
digestion, hormonal response,
immune system response--

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Blood pressure.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: All triggering
off our heart, right?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
the coherence state,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the rhythmic beating
patterns of the heart,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
which we call heart rhythms,
become very nice and ordered.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a synchronization in the
rhythmic beating of the heart.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
All the other systems are
synchronizing to that,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and you have this very
efficient physiological state,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.592 align:middle line:84%
where less energy
is being wasted.

00:17:03.592 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is something we're
going to see later is these

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:06.549 align:middle line:90%
actual--

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: We'll see that, yeah.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
psychophysiological,

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:84%
which means there's a
psychological component.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is often triggered
by feeling positive emotions.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones
associated with heart.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling care
or love or compassion,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.771 align:middle line:84%
we generally have
an opportunity to be

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:90%
triggering the coherent state.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it goes
back to feeling?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.363 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Back to feeling.

00:17:28.363 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And once we're in the coherent
state, then those emotions,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:84%
those kind of emotions
become much easier to feel.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.192 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to come up with
that feeling yourself?

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: To generate
it from the inside.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To generate
it from the inside.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And as-- we'll go
through techniques as we go

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
through our dialogue today,
you'll-- we'll give people ways

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
in which it can help them do
that using associative memory

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and things to trigger
emotional responses that are

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:90%
regenerative.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But all this adds up to you can
measure this whole thing that's

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:90%
going on in the body.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.374 align:middle line:84%
You do it through
looking at heart rhythms.

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Heart rhythms, there's a
medical term for that, too.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It's called heart rate
variability analysis-- HRV.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: HRV, OK.

00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: What that's measuring
is not just a heart rate,

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
like you get on a pulse
monitor on a piece of exercise

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
equipment that's telling you
75 beats a minute or whatever.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
If we go to a doctor,
and the doctor says,

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, your heart rate
is 75 beats a minute,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
what that doctor actually told
you was that's an average.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
An average is 75 beats a minute.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't beating at 75
beats for the minute.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, right, my average.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so the
timing between each heartbeat

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:84%
is actually subtly changing
between every single heart

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:90%
beat.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you analyze
those subtle changes,

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.182 align:middle line:84%
you're doing heart rate
variability analyses.

00:18:43.182 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're measuring the
variability that's happening,

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
not just the
standard heart rate.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
We want a lot of variability,
that's a sign of health.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We want a wide range of
speeds at which our heart can

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
pump and do its
cardiovascular job.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
We also want to have some
ability to modulate or control

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
those heart rhythms,
so that rather

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
than them being chaotic and
irregular, they are more smooth

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:90%
and ordered.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Many things affect
heart rhythms.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Movement, right
now our speech is

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.108 align:middle line:84%
going to make them
jagged to some degree,

00:19:14.108 --> 00:19:15.661 align:middle line:90%
because the heart is having to--

00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so movement.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Listen,
it's fine, but emotion

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:84%
triggers lots of changes
in our heart rhythms.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And researchers didn't know
this until our scientists

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute of HeartMath
began to uncover these things.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They really hadn't studied it
from the emotional perspective.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So what your viewers are
seeing now on the screen

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.462 align:middle line:84%
are heart rate
variability analysis data.

00:19:38.462 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
In the top view of
that graph-- and we're

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
looking at 200 seconds
of time on each graph--

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
you see a very jagged
and irregular pattern.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is a person that is
not moving, they're not talking,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason for it
to be jagged and irregular,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.242 align:middle line:84%
but they are feeling a
feeling of frustration.

00:19:53.242 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, they're
not moving, OK.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In the
experiment, we just said,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.788 align:middle line:84%
think about something that
makes you feel frustrated.

00:19:58.788 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is a lot of
timing changes happening in

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.695 align:middle line:84%
over a short time span,
speeding up and slowing down,

00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and speeding up
and slowing down.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.794 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
pattern is happening.

00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:08.834 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's irregular.

00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's sending
signals through the body that

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:84%
cascade, like up into
the brain, for example.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And when those signals get
into the brain or cascade

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, it
creates a condition

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.635 align:middle line:90%
called cortical inhibition.

00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
The higher perceptual
centers are less active.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
They begin to shut down, so
we don't think as clearly.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So we're not as smart.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we can even
have reaction things going,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:90%
like we knock something over--

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.381 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, clumsy.

00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --whatever, we don't
even have full-brain capacity.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the bottom
view on that graph,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we see this pretty
sine wave-like pattern.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the same
person a few minutes later.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But now we've asked them to feel
the feeling of appreciation,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
appreciate something
in your life.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So they're shifting
from feeling frustrated

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:90%
to feeling appreciative.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And the heart rhythms
respond accordingly

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to the change they made
in their emotional state.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
When you have the sine
wave-like pattern,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that is what coherence
looks like in the body.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is this
highly-ordered state.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.248 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
being in the flow

00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
or being in the zone,
an athlete in the zone.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a very aware state.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sleepy-time,
just relaxed state.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a state where you are
operating really at your best.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the antidote
to stress is coherence?

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Correct.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
coherence by looking

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:90%
at changes in our heart rhythms.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.832 align:middle line:84%
Coherence and stress can't
live in the same room.

00:21:32.832 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Law of physics, yeah.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.748 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Coherence
will move stress out.

00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So we learn to
shift these emotions

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.323 align:middle line:84%
and learn to get more
in the coherent state,

00:21:39.323 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
then we can better
manage our stress.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's great
benefit in that.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
We can improve our
health that way,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
we can certainly perform better
in life, we communicate better.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.423 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Better
relationships, yeah, overall.

00:21:49.423 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You got it.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, how does
that experience with us

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:84%
physiologically affect
the, as you said earlier,

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
the environment and then,
ultimately, affect the planet?

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
How does that-- how
does one little person?

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, certainly,
as one little person,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.474 align:middle line:84%
we are still putting
out an energy

00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that's contributing
to the consciousness

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:90%
climate of the planet.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Consciousness climate?

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's what I
like to call it, yeah.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we live
in a field of energy

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:90%
that's reflecting back to us.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Not just what we
think in our minds,

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:90%
but what we feel in our hearts.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Constantly around
us, there's fields of energy.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All the time.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:90%
And we have our own field.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.152 align:middle line:90%
We produce our own field.

00:22:28.152 --> 00:22:30.485 align:middle line:84%
And it's measurable through
that one type of measurement

00:22:30.485 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
earlier, but there's

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
more fields and more fields
that we're producing ourself.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So we are creating our own
field environment all the time.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And what feeds that
field environment?

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Our emotions are
changing the energy

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that goes into the field.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And that energy's
going out from us.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're affecting
it, the external situation

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.949 align:middle line:90%
is not affecting us?

00:22:50.949 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, internal
situation can affect us,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:90%
but we also affect it.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship
between the two.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.343 align:middle line:84%
And we have more conscious
control over that

00:22:57.343 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever realized before.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, OK, for example,
a friend of mine cannot stand

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:90%
going through airport security.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Feels like she
doesn't have choice,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
feels like she
doesn't have control.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So she goes to the situation
with anxiety around that.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.682 align:middle line:84%
Now, in her mind,
it's that situation

00:23:14.682 --> 00:23:17.015 align:middle line:84%
that's causing her the stress,
because beforehand she'll

00:23:17.015 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:90%
be fine.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And then she goes up
to that situation,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and I see her body
start to tense up,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and I see the
experience, and then

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
she starts to get into an
altercation with a TSA member,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes on
from there, it cascades.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So how are you saying
that's coming from her?

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
the environment.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, she can control
one thing in that situation.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:84%
She can't control,
like you said,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
the process of having
to go through that

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.187 align:middle line:90%
to get on an airplane.

00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.695 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: She can't stop that.

00:23:41.695 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
If she wants to get
on the airplane.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If she wants
to get on the airplane,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:90%
that's what she's got to do.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So she has one
choice, and that's

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
her internal reaction
to that situation.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:90%
She can control that.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.079 align:middle line:84%
Just like-- I'll use another
example-- a traffic jam.

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
We can't control we're in
the traffic jam, right?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, OK,
that's a good one.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now, what
are going to do?

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
We can only control
our reaction to it.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can either let that
traffic jam or that TSA

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
experience, the
screening experience,

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
be stressful and to
debilitate us in certain ways,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.576 align:middle line:84%
and certainly rob us of
energy as we go through it.

00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Or we can make a
conscious choice

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.658 align:middle line:84%
to begin to shift that
perspective on it.

00:24:14.658 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean we have to like
either one of them necessarily.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We can get to a place--
a more neutral place,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:84%
to where we're not
draining as much energy,

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to where we are more
accepting of that,

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
more allowing of what
we have to go through.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, that's a
perfect example, actually,

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
because it's these little shifts
we make day to day that add up.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what really makes
the difference in our lives

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is the moment-to-moment,
day-to-day choices we make.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So we can change our
attitude and at least

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:84%
get to a more neutral,
accepting place with it.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And that saves a lot of energy.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not draining energy
through this stressful reaction

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then
that affects, then--

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that
her experience of that

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of people, just
different experiences of things

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.181 align:middle line:90%
affects, then, our environment.

00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It affects
our own energy field.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
That energy field relates
to the larger energy field,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
so we're contributing to that.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
As more and more people
start making these choices

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:84%
within themselves to not go
through the same old reactive

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
patterns that we've gone through
for a long time, that they've

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:84%
had enough of that-- it is time
to step up and time to move on

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and to be something different.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Then, collectively
as we do that,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
it begins to put out a
larger field of energy

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:90%
that impacts the Earth itself.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth's energy fields,
we know, they impact us.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
relationship there.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of the
most important things,

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I think, we all do to contribute
to changing the world.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They're the things we need to
do with the organizations we're

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
involved in, the projects
we do, the television

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
shows I do-- all of that.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing is what are we

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.184 align:middle line:84%
doing in our moment-to-moment,
day-to-day lives

00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:90%
on the internal level?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In our own hearts.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: In our own hearts.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn to make
these shifts-- and these

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.194 align:middle line:90%
are my heroes.

00:25:52.194 --> 00:25:54.193 align:middle line:84%
The people that make these
shifts are my heroes.

00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:55.825 align:middle line:84%
And when I watch
somebody sort of bend

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:58.979 align:middle line:84%
an attitude, where they know
they're going to go this way

00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and they don't, and they find
a way to get out of themselves,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and they turn it around.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of
thing that inspires me.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have the-- I
mentioned earlier that you're

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:84%
on the Steering Committee of
the Global Coherence Initiative.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So that in itself
is basically taking

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
HeartMath to the
next level, isn't it?

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Well, it's an aspect.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We work in a lot of
different ways at HeartMath,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
right from the very
bottom up, the ground up,

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.119 align:middle line:84%
providing training programs
for the underserved,

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:30.785 align:middle line:84%
teaching them techniques
and things that

00:26:30.785 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:90%
can improve their lives.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
People that don't normally
get these type of things.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And all the way through the
work we do with corporations

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and health care systems, and all
the personal growth processes

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.355 align:middle line:84%
we have, and our
Heart Mastery program,

00:26:41.355 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and all those things that we
do-- what the Global Coherence

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Initiative is is a part of
the Institute of HeartMath,

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:90%
they're a nonprofit.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the
top-down approach,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.785 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that
change begins to occur

00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:55.505 align:middle line:90%
when consciousness changes.

00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:57.094 align:middle line:90%
What can change consciousness?

00:26:57.094 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The way I see the
model working in a way

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
is you have changing
consciousness, which

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
impacts changes in the
psychological paradigms,

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:90%
which we base reality on.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
As those begin to
shift and change,

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.513 align:middle line:84%
then that filters down into
the various systems that

00:27:10.513 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
sort of govern how
the world functions,

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and then down on the
daily lives of people.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.782 align:middle line:84%
And so it starts with
us making changes

00:27:17.782 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that affect the
consciousness, then

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
it feeds back down
to the system.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what people are

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
aspiring to do, many now, in
this era, which generically

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:90%
been called "the shift."

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
How do we create a
change in consciousness

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.564 align:middle line:84%
that's going to create a
new world and better world?

00:27:31.564 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Global
Coherence Initiative

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:84%
says, OK, we've been doing
HeartMath for a long time.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:84%
It all started out as a process
of self-discovery and spiritual

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.524 align:middle line:84%
involvement for the
founders of HeartMath.

00:27:41.524 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's do some of that again.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I like it
when I see organizations

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
that start from a personal
mission and a personal healing

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.771 align:middle line:84%
I always know that
they're going to make

00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:90%
a big impact on the world.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.374 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We never really
got away from that.

00:27:52.374 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly can say,
personally, I never did.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But we went-- we've
done a lot of work

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
to really bring this down to
society in a different way.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's always been that for me
and will always be that for me.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The Global Coherence Initiative
is a little more overt

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's what it is.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a membership
organization,

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
where membership
is free, that has

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:90%
a website at glcoherence.org.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And it brings people
together from all

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.100 align:middle line:84%
around the world who want to
use their heart-focused care

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.105 align:middle line:84%
and intention to
energetically make

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:84%
a contribution to the
betterment of the world

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and betterment of others.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's done through-- you
become a member on the website

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
for free, if you want,
and you get access

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to things like webinars
and teleseminars,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.546 align:middle line:84%
and other information
that's there.

00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
interesting people involved

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
in this-- other committee
members or people like Gregg

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Braden, Marci Shimoff, Lynne
McTaggart, Bruce Lipton, Rollin

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
McCraty, Deborah
Rozman-- it goes on,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the great list of people that
are involved in all of this.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we put out what's
called care focuses, which

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:84%
mean when we see needs
in the world, of course,

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
there could be something every
hour, but at certain times,

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
we put out care focuses,
where we ask the people who

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
are members to use the
power of their heart

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:84%
to put that energy out,
to put that care out.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.828 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's a good example
of something like that?

00:29:18.828 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: A natural disaster.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know people
are suffering.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
The kind of care
focus we put out,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:84%
which Doc Childre, our
founder, puts a lot of time

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
into writing, would be not to
prevent this from happening

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
or things like that, or it'd
be to lessen the effects,

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:90%
to be pragmatic about this.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:90%
How do we lessen the effects?

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Another example might
be a hurricane's coming.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Rather than putting
a care focus out

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.895 align:middle line:84%
that says we want to stop the
hurricane, what we put out

00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is let's help people deal
with the emotions associated

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:84%
with the impending inconvenience
they might go through.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're careful on that
to be realistic about what

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.995 align:middle line:90%
these things can do.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are many organizations
doing something similar.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad for that.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And we partner
with some of them.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's
the whole point.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But the part we bring
to the party is in the science.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.613 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We have
developed technology

00:30:11.613 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
at the Institute
of HeartMath that

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.560 align:middle line:84%
measures subtle changes in
the Earth's energetic fields.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The Earth produces
energetic fields itself.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Part of the Earth
is a living system

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%
are these energetic fields.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:90%
There are two primarily.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
One's called the
geomagnetic field,

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:84%
most people are
familiar with that.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.754 align:middle line:84%
That's what a compass is picking
up is the geomagnetic field.

00:30:29.754 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting, OK.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's created
by the iron core

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:84%
spinning in the center of
the Earth, creating a field,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:90%
energy around the Earth.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:90%
The other's call the ionosphere.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.014 align:middle line:84%
And it's a field less dense
than the geomagnetic field, that

00:30:42.014 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:84%
operates just above
the atmosphere

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and goes up into space.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the last field
we have-- the last part

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth is an
energetic system.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
These fields are protective
layers around our planet.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Without the fields, there
would be no life here.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they're a part
of what protects us

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.765 align:middle line:84%
from incoming solar
radiation, the cosmic rays,

00:31:02.765 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
things that would killed us

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:90%
if we didn't have these fields.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.024 align:middle line:90%
So we know these fields exist.

00:31:10.024 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research has
been done already,

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and more is being
done now, showing

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.372 align:middle line:84%
that when these fields
begin to change--

00:31:15.372 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and they change all
the time, they always

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:84%
fluctuate-- that
there is impact on us.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Things like increases in
crime rates, health issues,

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:84%
terrorism, even wars
have been linked

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to changes in these
cycles-- solar cycles

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.285 align:middle line:90%
that impact these fields.

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
there's a relationship,

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.200 align:middle line:90%
that the field's impacting us.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:90%
So we know it's coming this way.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So the hypothesis
that we're testing--

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.663 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, wait,
can you tell ahead

00:31:39.663 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of time that those
fields are shifting

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.455 align:middle line:84%
and that we will have
higher crime rates?

00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In a way
you can, because you

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:84%
can look at the solar
activity, for example,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.833 align:middle line:84%
and know that there's
going to be an impact,

00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
because there's been a
solar flare, et cetera.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You don't know what
effect it's going to have

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.564 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:31:55.564 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to look sort of back
through the rear view mirror

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to see what happened
and then correlate

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.953 align:middle line:90%
those things to build a picture.

00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, the
solar cycles, if you

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
look at the data
on the solar cycles

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and how they go through these
13-year solar cycle periods,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and you see that
they're attached

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
to certain types
of events, you can

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.262 align:middle line:84%
begin to see the possibility
those events would occur again.

00:32:15.262 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm of the belief that you can
actually offset some of that,

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.845 align:middle line:84%
you can change it, but you can
see that there are potentially

00:32:20.845 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
events that would occur relative
to the cycles of the past.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do they
affect electronics?

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.262 align:middle line:90%
Do they affect human beings?

00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:90%
All of the above?

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All of it.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All if it.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you can
look at the cycles?

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sure.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So the hypotheses we have
is that mass human emotion,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
whether that's positive
emotion or negative emotion,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.422 align:middle line:84%
is also having an
impact on the fields.

00:32:44.422 --> 00:32:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's in
reverse as well?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: In reverse.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.079 align:middle line:84%
The reason to believe that
is if they're affecting us,

00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:51.554 align:middle line:84%
why would we not have a
relationship to affect them?

00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that's interesting

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is that some of the
frequencies produced

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
by the-- that are
found in the ionosphere

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the same
frequencies found

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:90%
in the human heart and brain.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.928 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So we know there's
an energetic alignment--

00:33:04.928 --> 00:33:06.157 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As above, so below.

00:33:06.157 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --alignment
between the two.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So the hypothesis is is when
we have large numbers of people

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.520 align:middle line:84%
feeling something similar,
that that sends out

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
enough energy that impacts these
fields that can be measured.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, let's
say there's a major event.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be something positive.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It could be the opening of an
Olympics or something, possibly

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:90%
that could be detected.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say that there's
a major disaster--

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.554 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Space shuttle.

00:33:31.554 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And
people are feeling--

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:84%
all over the world are feeling
a sense of angst and upset,

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and all that, that
could be measured.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal of
the project in a sense

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific
perspective would

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:84%
be to show that our thoughts,
our feelings, our emotions,

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:84%
our prayers, our meditations,
our intentions-- all

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:84%
these things that we do and
have done for thousands of years

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
are putting out a collective
energy that is measurable,

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that is impacting
and contributing

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to what goes on in the Earth
as a living system, that there

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.007 align:middle line:84%
is that direct
connection to that.

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, and this
is down the road,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
the science has
to be done right.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I'd like to be
able to say we can bring people

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:84%
together in the coherent state,
a large number of people,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe 350,000 is an
estimate of what we need,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to be operating in another
level of coherence,

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
putting out care and intention
toward something that

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:84%
could then be measured in
the fields, that could then

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
be correlated with
something positive that

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.868 align:middle line:90%
occurred in society.

00:34:31.868 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot
of experimentation

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.290 align:middle line:90%
to get that job done.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Right now we have,
for example, we

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.190 align:middle line:84%
have these-- we have
monitoring sites.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:84%
We have one in
northern California.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We have one in the
United Kingdom.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:90%
We have one in Saudi Arabia.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:84%
There'll be two more
coming very, very soon,

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
one in northern Canada
and one in New Zealand.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately, we'll have 12.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.997 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
looking at data now.

00:34:55.997 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to make sense
out of what they're seeing.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of filtering
that has to be done.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research to
do this in a way that

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.144 align:middle line:90%
can be definitive and empirical.

00:35:07.144 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So the research will
contribute to the understanding

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual nature and
our collective consciousness.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It will also contribute to
the academic understanding

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of the fields themselves.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's both above
and below again,

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and the balance that,
I think, HeartMath

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:90%
tries to bring to things.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So if we do this though,
one of the committee members

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is Jack Canfield, the author
of "Chicken Soup for the Soul,"

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me
one day, Howard,

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I think this could
be the greatest

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:84%
experiment in the
history of the world.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It could be, yes, yes.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That you're going
to prove that all these things

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
we've believed for thousands
of years had this kind

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:90%
of a relationship and impact--

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That you could
actually quantify intention.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
That you could
scientifically quantify

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.012 align:middle line:90%
the field of intention.

00:35:49.012 --> 00:35:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of potential in that.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.444 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
patience, letting

00:35:56.444 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
scientists do what
scientists need

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.399 align:middle line:84%
to do to unfold this
in the right way

00:36:00.399 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:84%
is real important, because
you don't want to blow this.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, in a sense, with
pseudo science or things

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
really stand behind.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And to do it right would
be an amazing piece of work

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that could really change
history in a way in terms

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:90%
of what's being implied here.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long has
the Global Coherence

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Initiative existed so far?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Three years.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Three years.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.591 align:middle line:90%
So it's relatively young?

00:36:21.591 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Oh, there's something
like 36,000-38,000 members now.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They're from 85
different countries.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do events where
you set a universal intention

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:90%
with these members and--

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.253 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sometimes we do.

00:36:34.253 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm saying, that's
what a care focus would be.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Saying, you know, we-- there's
an impending economic situation

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:90%
coming up.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:84%
How can we lessen
the effect of that

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
if we put out our
care towards it?

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, part of the
Global Coherence Initiative

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:84%
is whatever methods and
systems you use, that's fine.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not about
screening any of that.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:90%
People can do as they like.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.180 align:middle line:90%
They can do what they want to.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.219 align:middle line:84%
We have our coherence
building techniques

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that we offer for people.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which we are going
to talk about in a minute.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.580 align:middle line:84%
The idea behind this and
the big picture behind this

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is that people can be a part
of something greater than them

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and that they can
fulfill purpose

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:84%
in life, where
there might be lack.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They can make an impact and
make a difference, where

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.070 align:middle line:84%
they might feel powerless in
their own lives to do that.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.982 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, it
starts a ripple effect--

00:37:26.982 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --of
helping other people

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:90%
and helping in other ways.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.967 align:middle line:84%
And if you see this and it's
quantifiable on a screen,

00:37:32.967 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:84%
great, then you can
go ahead and do it

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.850 align:middle line:84%
in your own lives, in your
relationships, and so forth.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
good languaging.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.838 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt about
there are sciences

00:37:39.838 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that-- simple ways
of looking at it

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:84%
would be that the
science that we have

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
makes it easier for the heart
to go ahead and belie-- the head

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and
believe in the heart.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.929 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:37:51.929 --> 00:37:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It also makes things
more understanding, empirical.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.803 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, well, I don't
necessarily need science.

00:37:56.803 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And in some things,
I agree, you don't.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But when I can describe
this table to you,

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I could describe
it to you, but when

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
you can see it and touch it,
it's empirical, it's solid.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And there is more
belief that the table

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:84%
exists because
we're touching it.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:10.064 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It is the same
way HeartMath science helps

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:84%
us understand heart or
understand what love

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is and things like that, things
that we know inside already--

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
we have an intuitive
relationship to all

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.080 align:middle line:84%
these things-- but it just
adds that extra layer.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing, I think, however,

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.669 align:middle line:84%
is at this point in
HearthMath's evolution

00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is not to just look at us
as an organization that

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:90%
does great science.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.430 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's about the
tools and the techniques,

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and the lives we've
changed, and the lives we

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.370 align:middle line:84%
want to help change
in the future.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.787 align:middle line:90%
That's what's most important.

00:38:40.787 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
What I love about the way Dr.
Childre put this together,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:84%
it was always about what
people had in themselves,

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:84%
about bringing that
to the forefront,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
about helping them
be what they can be,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.067 align:middle line:84%
about them reaching
their next level

00:38:53.067 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:90%
for their own empowerment.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about a
dependent system

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
or a personality-based
system, and things like that.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It was about what you can
do and what anyone can do,

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and what we already have inside,
and how it's time for that now.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, it is.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like that
about that, too.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It goes from a personal level
of how we're dealing with stress

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in our everyday lives, which,
of course, then will affect

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:84%
other people and
how we are relating

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.583 align:middle line:84%
to other people in the
world, and then, of course,

00:39:15.583 --> 00:39:18.300 align:middle line:84%
affects the global
initiative, and then affects

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:90%
the outer ionosphere.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And then bring
it back to home like

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:84%
how we make a good choice
about what to eat for lunch.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it brings it
right back to the heart.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Right
back to the heart.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep, absolutely.

00:39:27.855 --> 00:39:29.938 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's where it
starts and ends with me.

00:39:29.938 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are going to go
through some of the techniques

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.698 align:middle line:84%
where we are going to actually
be able to demonstrate

00:39:34.698 --> 00:39:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to see the effectiveness
of how our thoughts affect

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the rhythmic patterns
of the heart,

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.672 align:middle line:84%
and then how that relates
to us on a global level.

00:39:44.672 --> 00:39:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I want to show
the emWave technology, which

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.941 align:middle line:84%
is the technology
piece that we developed

00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
at HeartMath that people
can have for themselves

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and use in their own
homes and businesses,

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.355 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they do.

00:39:54.355 --> 00:39:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to share
that with everybody

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and give you a
demonstration that you're

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:90%
going to help me with.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep, absolutely.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.216 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Then I want to share
some techniques with people

00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:84%
or a technique particular that's
been really, really important

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:90%
for me in the last year or so.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Very simple technique, but
I'm finding great value in it,

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and I want the opportunity
to share it with everybody.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to do that.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we're going

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to set up the
technology here so we

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
can have a
demonstration of this.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:84%
All right, we'll be right
back with Howard Martin.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Hi, welcome back.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my guest
is Howard Martin, the vice

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:84%
president-- the executive
vice president of HeartMath.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Before the break,
we were talking

00:40:29.355 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
about how the heart sends
information to the brain.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.944 align:middle line:84%
But how does the heart
receive information?

00:40:34.944 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
we definitely have

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.845 align:middle line:84%
done one study that may
show that the heart is also

00:40:38.845 --> 00:40:40.185 align:middle line:90%
a receptor of information.

00:40:40.185 --> 00:40:42.643 align:middle line:84%
Sure it gets information from
the brain, controlling timing

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:84%
of the heart beat, but I'm
talking about information

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.275 align:middle line:84%
that applies to what we
call heart intelligence.

00:40:49.275 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:84%
It's called the intuition study,
the physiology of intuition.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.102 align:middle line:90%
We could do-- perfect.

00:40:54.102 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: What our scientists
at the Institute of HeartMath

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.535 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do is to
look at was there

00:40:58.535 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:84%
a way to begin to
decode what happens

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.891 align:middle line:90%
in the intuitive process.

00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So they did a study where they
had a group of test subjects,

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were monitoring all
kinds of things on their body--

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:84%
brainwave activity, skin
response, heart activity-- lots

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of things being monitored
all at the same time.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.275 align:middle line:84%
Test subjects were set
in front of a computer.

00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:17.914 align:middle line:90%
They would push a button.

00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Indeterminate amount
of time would go on

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.914 align:middle line:90%
and then a picture would emerge.

00:41:20.914 --> 00:41:22.455 align:middle line:84%
And they would push
the button again,

00:41:22.455 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and another picture
would emerge.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Pictures were either
very horrific,

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.459 align:middle line:84%
like very things that
are very upsetting--

00:41:28.459 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disturbing?

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Disturbing pictures.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Or there would be very
beautiful pictures.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so they
just would hit the button,

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.710 align:middle line:84%
sit there, and wait
for the picture.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And the picture would
emerge, and all this data

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.410 align:middle line:90%
was being collected.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The person was
hitting the button?

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So then,
the data began

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.460 align:middle line:90%
to be analyzed from this study.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was was,
oh, my gosh, look at this.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, the
body is responding

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to the upcoming
picture about 6 seconds

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
before the picture
actually shows up.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.107 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
this was really--

00:41:57.107 --> 00:41:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yeah.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --interesting
what's happening here,

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.307 align:middle line:84%
this picture's-- is
not even there yet,

00:42:01.307 --> 00:42:03.640 align:middle line:84%
but the body's doing what it
would do if the picture was

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's intuiting?

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Intuiting
the upcoming picture.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Now where it got
more intriguing is

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:84%
as they began to decode and
decode this information more--

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
in a more refined
way, they found

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that the first physiological
responder to the picture that

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.655 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there was the heart.

00:42:20.655 --> 00:42:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, they
could measure it, wow.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.687 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: 6 seconds
out the heart

00:42:23.687 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
began to do what it would do if
the picture was on the screen.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could it tell if it was
in a love or if it was in fear,

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:90%
or was it just a spike?

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, it was like being
able to tell whether it was

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.234 align:middle line:84%
responding to a horrific
picture or a beautiful picture,

00:42:36.234 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:84%
it was like it was
doing all that.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The brain was the
second responder.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the two began
to work together,

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
they couple together
about a second

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.650 align:middle line:84%
before the picture
actually emerged.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.417 align:middle line:84%
So what this shows is
that the possibility

00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is a
receptor of information.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's receiving information
from the outside.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up information
from the field, so to speak,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that we all live in--
this information field.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And what the researchers said
is it appears as if-- you know,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
if something is significant,
emotionally significant,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.150 align:middle line:84%
it could be precipitating a
physiological response that

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.230 align:middle line:84%
would be congruent with
the upcoming event.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you have a
feeling about a car accident

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and you delay
yourself in leaving,

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll never really see
the evidence of that,

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
but that could very
well be your intuition

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.704 align:middle line:84%
at work being
amazingly accurate.

00:43:24.704 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Finding future events,
looking at future events.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And we've had these experiences
in our lives, many people have.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have to where
certain decisions that I made

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be, wow, how
did I make that choice?

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
intelligent thing to do.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
In talking to the
scientists, they said,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.290 align:middle line:84%
look, it appears as if we do
have intelligences within us,

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.540 align:middle line:84%
intelligence capacities
that are there all the time.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That our body, in this case, may
be scanning for future events

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.650 align:middle line:84%
all the time, that
may be reading

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.360 align:middle line:84%
the field, beyond time
and space into the future.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And that these are
the kinds of things

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.894 align:middle line:84%
that will emerge more as
we evolve as human beings.

00:43:58.894 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
This type of intelligence
will come more

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to the forefront of
what's normal for us.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Right now it's phenomenalistic,
it's not understood,

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:90%
it feels bizarre.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.456 align:middle line:84%
But in the future, as we unfold
ourselves as human beings,

00:44:09.456 --> 00:44:10.830 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of
new ways in which

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.694 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to
perceive things.

00:44:12.694 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let me ask
you, just knowing all

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that you know about the heart
and about the human resonance

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.180 align:middle line:84%
field, and about intuition,
do you live your life any

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:24.095 align:middle line:84%
differently now than you
did, say, 20-30 years ago?

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.345 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Before
you knew all this?

00:44:26.345 --> 00:44:28.102 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Listen, come on, yeah.

00:44:28.102 --> 00:44:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where I
would be if I hadn't

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:84%
found a new connection
to my heart.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I can say that I feel like,
yeah, I'm growing-- still

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.380 align:middle line:84%
growing like everyone
else, but I'm certainly

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.916 align:middle line:84%
less emotionally reactive
than I've ever been.

00:44:42.916 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm certainly kinder.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.485 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly more
compassionate.

00:44:45.485 --> 00:44:46.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm certainly--

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Funnier.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Maybe funnier.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.174 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even better looking.

00:44:50.174 --> 00:44:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.548 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I have to
be careful, because I

00:44:52.548 --> 00:44:55.840 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get too
good-looking for my height.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.785 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, at least,
it builds character.

00:44:57.785 --> 00:44:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:44:59.820 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of things like that.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's hard to
describe what awareness is.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But I know my awareness
is very different,

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:84%
the way I perceive things,
the way I perceive myself,

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:84%
others, the world
itself, is certainly

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.131 align:middle line:84%
very different than
what it would have been.

00:45:12.131 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
exciting about it

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to me, Lisa, is that my life
does not have a ceiling on it,

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:84%
whereas many people my
age, by now, they've

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.852 align:middle line:90%
sort of topped out.

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.143 align:middle line:90%
They've done what they've done.

00:45:23.143 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They have basically
the awareness package

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.170 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to have.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.650 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through
their careers

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and reached a certain point.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.689 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're at a different
phase in their life.

00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:33.309 align:middle line:84%
But there's not a whole lot
of upper room for many people,

00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:34.975 align:middle line:84%
at least their
perception of themselves.

00:45:34.975 --> 00:45:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's what causes
a lot of depression

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.041 align:middle line:84%
in people who are
retired, yes, absolutely.

00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But the
way I feel today

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:43.422 align:middle line:84%
is that best is yet to come it
feels like every day for me.

00:45:43.422 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real gift.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what
I mean by awareness.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.271 align:middle line:84%
It's sometimes harder to
describe the gift of awareness

00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's interesting,
because what this does

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.095 align:middle line:84%
and what we're going to
be demonstrating here

00:45:53.095 --> 00:45:56.210 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
actually quantify

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.560 align:middle line:90%
transformation in coherence.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I went a little step
beyond you right there.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Now, you did.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.584 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I did, yeah,
on transformation,

00:46:02.584 --> 00:46:04.640 align:middle line:84%
because I was just thinking
wouldn't it be great

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:84%
if you could quantify
transformation.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But what this
essentially does is

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.340 align:middle line:84%
it quantifies the
field of coherence,

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.512 align:middle line:90%
where transformation occurs.

00:46:14.512 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Occurs, yeah.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.390 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at heart rhythms.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the stuff we talked
about earlier about heart rate

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
variability and about you
saw the frustrated pattern

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.510 align:middle line:84%
versus the appreciative pattern,
one is inhibiting the brain,

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.150 align:middle line:84%
one is opening it up, and a lot
of things are going on there.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And that that
sine-wave-like pattern

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.000 align:middle line:84%
would be a representation
of what coherence looks like

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.200 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the
measuring heart rhythms.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Once we understood all
this, we recognized

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.202 align:middle line:90%
this is really valuable.

00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:38.660 align:middle line:84%
This is an excellent
way for people

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to train themselves to be
more in the coherent state

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.430 align:middle line:90%
more often.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And it can be used
for a lot of things.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:45.875 align:middle line:84%
So we developed the
emWave technology.

00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's spelled
E-M-W-A-V-E. And it-- today,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.410 align:middle line:90%
it's all over the world.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's over 85
countries people

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
using emWaves, everything from
educators to Olympic athletes

00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to business professionals
to hundreds of thousands

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.350 align:middle line:84%
of people for their
spiritual practices.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It just goes on
where this is going.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we're
going to demonstrate it.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There's
two forms, really.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:10.550 align:middle line:84%
One is this little
handheld unit.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.654 align:middle line:84%
This handheld unit
you can use portably--

00:47:12.654 --> 00:47:14.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Pretty picture's
coming up on the screen.

00:47:14.695 --> 00:47:16.445 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --on the go,
like on an airplane

00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:19.490 align:middle line:84%
or like in between things in
your work day-- a lot of ways

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
that I use my emWave,
the handheld unit.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But it connects to the
computer, to any computer--

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.670 align:middle line:90%
a PC, Mac, any of them.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:30.692 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it allows you
to see the data in real time.

00:47:30.692 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:84%
In the handheld
unit, you're seeing

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:84%
changes in your coherence
level through changes

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.132 align:middle line:90%
in a light that's here.

00:47:35.132 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:84%
When you plug it
into the computer,

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.270 align:middle line:84%
you see a computer
program that allows

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.930 align:middle line:84%
you to see your heart
rhythms in real time

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.184 align:middle line:84%
and see your coherence
scores changing.

00:47:43.184 --> 00:47:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can take--
also what's fun

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:84%
about this is you could take it
out, use it portably, plug it

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.465 align:middle line:90%
in and upload the data.

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:49.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:47:49.465 --> 00:47:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So you can in a way--

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can
be out and about.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --quantify
your progress

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in building coherence, which
relates to your transformations

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:56.750 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, exactly.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So the way I use it is
I use it to prepare for things,

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and I use it to get over things.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it helps
build resilience,

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:05.570 align:middle line:90%
and that's definitely--

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It helps
to reduce stress,

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and it builds that
resilience in your system.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I've used it in
my morning meditations.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I use it to help guide that to
get the most out of that time

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And at the end-- near the
end of the day some time,

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll use it again for a little
while just to sort of shake off

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.790 align:middle line:84%
the sort of the
static buildup of--

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's good.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --that I go through
and anyone goes through

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.150 align:middle line:90%
during the course of their day.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually, that
could help you sleep better,

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:28.990 align:middle line:84%
because the first part of
sleep is downloading and--

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:30.739 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, there's
a book that people

00:48:30.739 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:84%
can get that associates
this with sleep.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.731 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, people use
this to help deal

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%
with things like the emotional
weight-- emotional weight loss.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.525 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So as I said,
there's a lot of applications--

00:48:42.525 --> 00:48:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's so many.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --people can try and
can look on websites and things

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:46.780 align:middle line:90%
and see more about it.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so
many things related

00:48:48.363 --> 00:48:50.822 align:middle line:84%
to stress that we haven't even
talked about yet, but, yeah.

00:48:50.822 --> 00:48:52.154 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You know that's right.

00:48:52.154 --> 00:48:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It's used as a stress reduction
tool in many ways for people.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways-- I'll
give you one more example,

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:58.900 align:middle line:90%
then I want you to try it.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I'm most proud of

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.175 align:middle line:84%
is the work that the
Institute of HeartMath's

00:49:02.175 --> 00:49:04.960 align:middle line:84%
been doing with soldiers in the
military and their families.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And these many,
many stories we've

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:84%
gotten from military
health professionals

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and from soldiers themselves
about the importance

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.830 align:middle line:90%
of the emWave.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:15.891 align:middle line:90%
We're training soldiers.

00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're taking
these things with them

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.772 align:middle line:84%
into places like
Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:49:19.772 --> 00:49:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And they're using them there.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming home
saying, it was my life saver.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:84%
It was the thing that
kept me balanced,

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:90%
the only thing that helped me.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We've had just
many, many stories

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
like that that are just
heartwarming stories

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.290 align:middle line:90%
to use the phrase.

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And ultimately, this is
something we're teaching people

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do themselves,
to deal with PTSD,

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and to deal with the effects
of stressful situations,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.610 align:middle line:90%
is learning how to bounce back.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, as we
spoke about earlier,

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the main causes of
stress is your feeling

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of not having enough
time and the feeling

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:90%
of not having a choice.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.419 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that can
help you boun-- and change

00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:90%
that feeling.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, it begins to
train us how to do that better.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like you to try it.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:58.515 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that for me?

00:49:58.515 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would, yes.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: All right.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.451 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See if you can
get me to calm down.

00:50:01.451 --> 00:50:01.996 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:50:01.996 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Put this on your earlobe.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a sensor that's going to
pick up a pulse from your ear.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.970 align:middle line:90%
From Lisa's ear in this case.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It's plugged into
the handheld unit,

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.230 align:middle line:84%
which is plugged
in to the computer.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.454 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I do tend to have a
little bit of a busy life.

00:50:14.454 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You do.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.646 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wouldn't be surprised
if it was off the charts a bit.

00:50:19.646 --> 00:50:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Lets'
see what we have.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.436 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to
do is hit Start,

00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to calibrate
to Lisa's-- her pulse.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.100 align:middle line:90%
It just takes a few seconds.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But what if I'm nervous?

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Does it come up?

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's going to show.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: But that's OK.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But what I want
to do now is just

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to be normal, not
too nervous or anything.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is no normal.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Is there
a normal for you?

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nope.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Like you're
hanging out at the airport.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.560 align:middle line:90%
You're going to catch a plane.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.112 align:middle line:90%
Its on time.

00:50:39.112 --> 00:50:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And your heart rhythms.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.018 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing now-- I'll get
my arm out of the way here--

00:50:44.018 --> 00:50:46.340 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing Lisa's heart
rhythms in real time.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of a normal pattern.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.324 align:middle line:84%
And you remember that things
like movement, speech,

00:50:50.324 --> 00:50:51.740 align:middle line:84%
normal things like
that, are going

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to create the sort of the
irregular-looking pattern.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not bad that we
have this pattern when we first

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.740 align:middle line:90%
hook up to an emWave.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But now I want you to
think about some things

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.990 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
could be stressful.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right now?

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you think
about that, I want

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.528 align:middle line:84%
to point out to everybody
that's watching that you're

00:51:10.528 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:84%
seeing her heart rhythm
pattern right here.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Down here, what you're seeing
is her coherence level.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:84%
These bars are changing in
real time, every 5 seconds.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:21.400 align:middle line:84%
They're saying right now that
31% of the time since you

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.950 align:middle line:84%
started, you've been in low
coherence, which is normal.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.086 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: 40% of
the time, you've

00:51:26.086 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:84%
been in what's called
medium coherence, which

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.500 align:middle line:84%
means those heart rhythms are
becoming more sine-wave like,

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.190 align:middle line:90%
more ordered.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:31.465 --> 00:51:33.548 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The quality of
heart-brain communication

00:51:33.548 --> 00:51:34.380 align:middle line:90%
is improving.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:35.064 --> 00:51:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And
that's a great step.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that 16% of the time
you've been in high coherence.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.934 align:middle line:84%
High coherence is like
being in the zone.

00:51:41.934 --> 00:51:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like being in the flow.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Only 16% of the time?

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So far.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.685 align:middle line:90%
But we're going to switch that.

00:51:47.685 --> 00:51:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Right now you're
thinking about things

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.584 align:middle line:90%
that could be stressful for you.

00:51:51.584 --> 00:51:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can see what's
happening in real time.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing that happen
in real time on the screen

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's amazing.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.410 align:middle line:90%
So this is me feeling anxiety?

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
This is me feeling like
I'm judging myself?

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Does that look
like you feel inside?

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:06.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:06.273 --> 00:52:06.814 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:52:06.814 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:90%
But now, let's switch it.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to do a very
simple HeartMath technique.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm stuck on the
fact that I have-- OK, great.

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.476 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're going to
change the coherence score.

00:52:15.476 --> 00:52:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to do
your work on the inside.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.735 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like everyone
who's watching the show

00:52:20.735 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and
do it themselves.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a very simple technique
you can use any time, anywhere.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.310 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you are in
your life-- stressful family,

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.850 align:middle line:84%
stressful life, stressful job--
this is what we're teaching.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Three steps.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes, please.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.025 align:middle line:84%
First step is
called heart focus.

00:52:37.025 --> 00:52:39.655 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to shift, like
feel the energy coming down

00:52:39.655 --> 00:52:41.780 align:middle line:84%
from your head right into
the center of your chest,

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:90%
into the area of the heart.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And just focus your attention
there, casually and gently.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:54.934 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.934 --> 00:52:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'd
like you to do is

00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:00.875 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to begin to
breathe naturally and normally,

00:53:00.875 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:84%
but just a little bit deeper
than you normally would.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And breathe as if that breath
is coming in and out right

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.970 align:middle line:84%
through the center
of your chest.

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:12.925 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
heart-focused breathing.

00:53:12.925 --> 00:53:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Nice deep breaths, in and
out through the center

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:90%
of your chest.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Heart-focused breathing.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can feel my heartbeat.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Good.

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:37.825 align:middle line:84%
I want you to maintain
your heart focus

00:53:37.825 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and keep doing that
heart-focused breathing.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to go to the
third and most important step.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:46.044 align:middle line:90%
It's called heart feeling.

00:53:46.044 --> 00:53:51.195 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel the
love or care, for example,

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have for
someone in your life.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.520 align:middle line:84%
In your case, I know you
have a daughter that you're

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.770 align:middle line:90%
really, really close to.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:58.364 align:middle line:84%
Feel that love and care
you have for Kayla.

00:53:58.364 --> 00:54:00.030 align:middle line:84%
For others that are
doing the technique,

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:02.600 align:middle line:84%
it can be just a
feeling of well-being,

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.510 align:middle line:84%
like things are really
OK in your life,

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:84%
or feeling, perhaps,
if you have,

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.830 align:middle line:84%
when you know you've
been appreciated,

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:84%
you know when you've
done well, you

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:11.976 align:middle line:84%
know when you've
accomplished something.

00:54:11.976 --> 00:54:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Those are positive
emotions, too.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:19.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be grandiose.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:22.470 align:middle line:84%
They can be just good old solid
feelings of life's alright;

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.390 align:middle line:90%
everything's fine.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But in your case,
Lisa, if you want

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.834 align:middle line:84%
to feel that love, that
care, that appreciation

00:54:28.834 --> 00:54:31.000 align:middle line:84%
you have for your daughter,
that would be wonderful.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But keep going with
your heart focus,

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.110 align:middle line:84%
your heart-focused
breathing, and then feel

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.090 align:middle line:90%
that heart feeling.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:55:01.261 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:02.510 align:middle line:90%
You're doing just great.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:21.322 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.322 --> 00:55:22.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, what I'm going
to do now, Lisa,

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.321 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to stop
this from going.

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:27.499 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you what you did.

00:55:27.499 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, there
it is in real time.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to have a break
to be able to just--

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how often in your day
do you really get a chance

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to think of that beautiful
image in your mind of your baby

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.830 align:middle line:90%
sleeping?

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not that often.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's
always there, though.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.596 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's always there, yeah.

00:55:45.596 --> 00:55:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When you started
out, I stopped the program

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and restarted it, so we
could see a difference.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:51.480 align:middle line:84%
You had like, you know,
10% high coherence.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, after doing it
with the technique--

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.045 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, goodness.

00:55:54.045 --> 00:55:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --you're at 27.

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You're on a camera
right now, you're

00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.020 align:middle line:90%
doing a live television show.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And so there's naturally going
to be some more nervousness

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:04.000 align:middle line:84%
than you would have, say,
in a regular daily activity

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.900 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So to get 49% medium
coherence and 27% high

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.294 align:middle line:84%
coherence is a great
accomplishment.

00:56:10.294 --> 00:56:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In how many seconds?

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.220 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, we did it
for a couple minutes there.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, a couple-- Wow.

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But just
that shift in focus

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.690 align:middle line:84%
from the chaotic
rhythmic pattern

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:21.065 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see the more
smooth and harmonious pattern.

00:56:21.065 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you would, I'd like
you to hand me the sensor.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.102 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:56:24.102 --> 00:56:26.018 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And what I'm
going to do is show you

00:56:26.018 --> 00:56:28.511 align:middle line:84%
and everyone who's
watching what's possible.

00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Because my
physiology is just

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:90%
like anyone else's physiology.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not different than
someone else's, it's the same.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But because I practice
more, I have the ability

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to make some of these
shifts a little bit quicker.

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I want
to demonstrate this

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is just to show the listeners
and viewers that-- what's

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.775 align:middle line:84%
possible, that you can shift in
and out of this coherent state.

00:56:53.775 --> 00:56:54.941 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you've practiced.

00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:55.560 align:middle line:90%
You're--

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, of course, yeah.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --I mean, for years.

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.788 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --and that you
can make these shifts really

00:56:58.788 --> 00:56:59.540 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:04.890 align:middle line:84%
That it's not a process that's
something dawning that people

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:07.370 align:middle line:84%
can't get to, that with a
little practice you can do that.

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:10.036 align:middle line:84%
And if you can learn to shift in
and out of that coherent state,

00:57:10.036 --> 00:57:11.520 align:middle line:84%
think about the
usefulness of that.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.836 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You're going
along, things are busy.

00:57:13.836 --> 00:57:15.980 align:middle line:84%
You take a minute, you
pause, you make the shift,

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you bring in that
coherence, you open up

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.580 align:middle line:84%
another level of
heart-brain communication,

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.320 align:middle line:84%
you open yourself up to things
like intuitive intelligence,

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:84%
you give yourself a boost from
a physiological perspective that

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.700 align:middle line:84%
adds to your resilience,
and, if you do that often,

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.630 align:middle line:90%
then life gets better.

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you open yourself
up to your intuition,

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.350 align:middle line:84%
making better decisions,
thinking clearer,

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.260 align:middle line:90%
reducing, of course, stress.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But reducing the stress is
not a conversation in this.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.580 align:middle line:84%
This is about where
you're moving towards.

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:49.580 align:middle line:84%
This is about what does
create that type of coherence

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and how to change and
shift right away, no matter

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.810 align:middle line:90%
what environment you're in.

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:56.090 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing that you
could even use that.

00:57:56.090 --> 00:58:00.164 align:middle line:84%
So how many years have
you been practicing this?

00:58:00.164 --> 00:58:02.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can't talk,
because you're doing this.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, all right, good.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line
is-- the point

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is that we can do
this ourselves,

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.620 align:middle line:84%
that we can take any
situation that you're

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.400 align:middle line:84%
in-- you can go from
a work environment,

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.750 align:middle line:84%
you can go from
busy moms, you can

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:26.940 align:middle line:84%
go from being in an
argument, travel, all sorts

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.735 align:middle line:84%
of economic situations,
all that to situations

00:58:30.735 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:90%
where-- that are more coherent.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.705 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at that.

00:58:33.705 --> 00:58:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Look at that screen.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ballet movement.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I was unable to talk--
and I apologize for that--

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.200 align:middle line:84%
just because speech is going
to affect the heart rhythms.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But point I'm making is in
the middle of an interview--

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:43.544 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --I can go
right from the interview

00:58:43.544 --> 00:58:45.390 align:middle line:84%
into that perfect
sine-wave-like pattern,

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:48.390 align:middle line:84%
with very little time delay and
89% high coherence and do it.

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:49.057 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Get out!

00:58:49.057 --> 00:58:49.556 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:58:49.556 --> 00:58:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Look at that!

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that's the
skill that I want everybody

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:54.552 align:middle line:90%
to get and to be able to learn.

00:58:54.552 --> 00:58:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are many techniques
in the HeartMath system

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.860 align:middle line:84%
for a variety of things--
everything from project

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.894 align:middle line:84%
planning to decision making,
to communication-- lots

00:59:01.894 --> 00:59:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of techniques that
we have in the system

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.316 align:middle line:84%
itself that people learn through
heart mastery and training

00:59:06.316 --> 00:59:07.190 align:middle line:90%
programs, and things.

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But the basic core
of it is learning

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to make this internal shift,
to shift these emotional states

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, moment
to moment, day to day,

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and bring ourselves
into that coherent state

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.940 align:middle line:84%
periodically during
the course of the day.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where people can
achieve great benefit.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And that relates down
to what is spirituality

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:84%
when it comes down
to practicality?

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It's really about changing
our internal environment

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.546 align:middle line:90%
and being able to manage that.

00:59:31.546 --> 00:59:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's about
the decisions.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You just made a decision sitting
here to get into coherence.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And granted, Howard's
practiced a lot more,

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.680 align:middle line:84%
but to make that-- I mean, I
was even able to increase it.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And just making a decision.

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:46.520 align:middle line:90%
You're making a decision.

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.728 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with people
in training environments,

00:59:48.728 --> 00:59:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of course, in places
now we're going

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to do a program-- let's
say it's a two-day program.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Somebody will try the emWave
on a break or something,

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and they'll come up
to me later and say,

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.853 align:middle line:90%
I can't get into high coherence.

00:59:57.853 --> 01:00:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, just keep
doing what I shared with you

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.334 align:middle line:90%
and practice a little bit.

01:00:01.334 --> 01:00:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Usually, by the next
day, they come back

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to me excitedly saying
that now they're

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.095 align:middle line:90%
getting like 80% high coherence.

01:00:07.095 --> 01:00:10.185 align:middle line:84%
It can be that quick once
you catch the flow of it all.

01:00:10.185 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing is that
it's-- this is not this device

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:90%
making you being coherent.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It is the coherence
that's affecting--

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's
measuring what you're

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
doing to yourself on
the internal level.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.695 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's measuring.

01:00:22.695 --> 01:00:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The emWave itself
is doing nothing to you.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.814 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:00:25.814 --> 01:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's a
tool that's being

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:28.890 align:middle line:84%
used to monitor
what happens inside.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what we were talking
about earlier about the fact

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that the heart emits
signals, that the thoughts

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and your feelings
emit signals is,

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
as you can see here and
through the demonstration

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.790 align:middle line:90%
on the screen, is real.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just something
that you-- I mean,

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
actually emanates from you

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and goes out into your--
in your energy field.

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.112 align:middle line:84%
So-- There's actually
another technique

01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that you have as well
that you wanted to share.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Oh, yes, the
inner ease technique.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about it this way.

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
inner ease technique.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If you think about
things in terms of energetics,

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in terms of energies, and in
terms of different things,

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
emotions are like energies.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
There is a different energy
feeling from, let's say,

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.735 align:middle line:90%
care versus appreciation.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.944 align:middle line:84%
They have a different feeling
about them, don't they?

01:01:14.944 --> 01:01:15.735 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah.

01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Care has this sort of
rounded, wonderful, soft kind

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:19.770 align:middle line:90%
of feeling to it.

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Appreciation's got
a zing to it, even

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
in the way the sonics of it are.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.806 align:middle line:90%
It's like champagne bubbles.

01:01:25.806 --> 01:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
It's got a different thing.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
different feelings

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
have different sort
of frequencies,

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and they relate differently
to energy fields,

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the ones we produce and the
ones that we interact with.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Ease is one of
those frequencies.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy and a feeling.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just take it easy.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, that gives a
whole new reason to that.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, it's a feeling
that we can learn to access.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's part of like the new
intelligence package that

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
is coming into the world
today as consciousness

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.320 align:middle line:90%
begins to go through changes.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a different sort of
feeling and the energy to it

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that really sort of rounds the
corners, the edges off of life

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and makes things less harsh
and less tough to deal with.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling that
sort of sets up

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.279 align:middle line:84%
a buffer that can deflect stress
before it even gets to us.

01:02:14.279 --> 01:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this what
resilience is or is it

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
the step before resilience?

01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:19.255 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This is what
would feed resilience.

01:02:19.255 --> 01:02:19.932 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:02:19.932 --> 01:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Ease, obviously,
increases coherence.

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.389 align:middle line:84%
Coherence and
resilience are linked.

01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's the ease technique,
whether we used an emWave

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:28.950 align:middle line:84%
or we didn't, that's really
what's important here.

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
To me it's got a smooth,
silky feeling to it, you know,

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that just feels really
nice inside my system.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.890 align:middle line:90%
It is more common balance.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
It has a certain flow to it.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.192 align:middle line:84%
But it is not
putting me to sleep.

01:02:39.192 --> 01:02:40.400 align:middle line:90%
It's still engaged with life.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.979 align:middle line:84%
It's like a doorway into a
whole nother place for me--

01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --and
effectiveness that's

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:45.691 align:middle line:90%
really, really important.

01:02:45.691 --> 01:02:48.980 align:middle line:90%


01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The ease feeling is
bringing the heart

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
into the process to help guide
the mind and emotions as we

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.724 align:middle line:90%
navigate our way through life.

01:02:57.724 --> 01:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
As we go through a day to day,
we have all these thoughts,

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
we have all these feelings,
we have all this stuff--

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The mind chatter.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.315 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If I
bring the ease in,

01:03:04.315 --> 01:03:06.580 align:middle line:84%
it's like giving me a
better navigational package,

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
like my own internal GPS
goes up another level,

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
allowing me to see
into things, still

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to see around the corners
in the way of life,

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.575 align:middle line:84%
and to make better
decisions about things.

01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds great.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:19.991 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The way I use it, I
start my day out in the morning

01:03:19.991 --> 01:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and I do my own
heart-focused work

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and only spend 15
minutes with it.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.740 align:middle line:90%
I use my emWave.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.105 align:middle line:84%
I hook it up to my ear,
just a portable version.

01:03:27.105 --> 01:03:28.804 align:middle line:84%
It has audio tunes
that let you know

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
when you're in medium
or high coherence.

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'll hear those to let
me kind of where I am.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And that helps to keep
me sort of on track

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.792 align:middle line:84%
better, rather than
floating around, thinking

01:03:38.792 --> 01:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
about the meeting
I have coming up.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.157 align:middle line:84%
Or in case of this
morning, in the hotel,

01:03:42.157 --> 01:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking about all
the things I needed

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.700 align:middle line:90%
to do for this interview.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was like
time to let that go.

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of see the visual
image that I sometimes use is,

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.601 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've
seen those movies

01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
where these guys'll have
these computer screens,

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
they're almost like
sitting up in the air,

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be trying
to do something,

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.113 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll take--
wipe this off to the side,

01:03:58.113 --> 01:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
wipe that off the
side, and all that.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
They're moving data around.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So I like to take
all the stuff I'm

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.516 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- the thoughts and
the feelings and things that

01:04:05.516 --> 01:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
are going on me, just push
them off to the side like that

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and just open myself up to
bring in the ease frequency.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I just bring that
ease frequency into my system.

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, ease is also very
important for stress reduction.

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a stress reduction
technique, for sure.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So it has that
application to it as well.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.725 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do in
our time together today

01:04:26.725 --> 01:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is for you and I to do the
ease technique together.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, good, all right,
we get to do it together.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:31.081 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We get
to do it together.

01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:33.164 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing is to
go ahead and acknowledge

01:04:33.164 --> 01:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
whenever we're
stressed, it's OK.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge the feeling
that we're having stress.

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a great
reality check anyway.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.601 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And say, look,
I'm dealing with stress.

01:04:40.601 --> 01:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, but that's what's
going on with me right now.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And to be open and
acknowledge that.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:49.432 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with acknowledging

01:04:49.432 --> 01:04:50.265 align:middle line:90%
that we feel stress.

01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to
really acknowledge that.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The second step of the
ease technique, and we'll

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:56.780 align:middle line:90%
do this now.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
If you want to, you
can close your eyes.

01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So just do just like we did in
the other technique I shared,

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.441 align:middle line:84%
which was just a quick
coherence technique.

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Just the focus,
again, in the area of the heart.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.276 align:middle line:84%
When you do that,
you're really starting

01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:09.914 align:middle line:84%
to order more of the
cardio electricities

01:05:09.914 --> 01:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that are produced by the
heart when you focus.

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm gonna fall asleep
by the end of the show.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:13.951 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.116 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm going
to wake you back up.

01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to do the
heart-focused breathing again.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.930 align:middle line:90%


01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:26.912 align:middle line:84%
So you heart-focus and your
heart-focused breathing.

01:05:26.912 --> 01:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, gently
and casually just

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a feeling of
ease, a smooth, silky feeling,

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
something you're
learning to tune to,

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
something as-- An energy or
a frequency that I'm still

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.160 align:middle line:90%
learning to tune more to.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So just as best you
can right now, just

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
find that feeling of ease,
just that wonderful feeling

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.325 align:middle line:84%
inside that's sort of
taking the edges off

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:55.395 align:middle line:84%
of life, taking the
stress out of life.

01:05:55.395 --> 01:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've got that
Eagles song in my mind--

01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) I've got a peaceful--

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Just breathe it
right through the heart,

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
ease-- nice ease feeling.

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:14.890 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, you're
accumulating energy

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
in your system, you're building
up your own resilience bank

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:21.370 align:middle line:90%
account.

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's gonna--
Every moment any of us spend

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
in a time like this is
adding energy to our system.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.851 align:middle line:84%
As we add more
than we take away,

01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
then it begins to magnetize
different life experiences

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to us; it creates
a new life for us.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.517 align:middle line:84%
It begins to create a new
reality for ourselves.

01:06:38.517 --> 01:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with doing
things like this-- finding that

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
ease inside.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.417 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can open your eyes,
but the most important step,

01:06:45.417 --> 01:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
the fourth step, is
what do we do with this?

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Taking it, moving it forward in
our day, and actualizing it--

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, practical
application of it, yeah.

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --actualizing
that feeling

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.881 align:middle line:84%
and trying to maintain
it and hold on

01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:56.260 align:middle line:90%
to it as we go through the day.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
The way I do that
is, you know, there

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
are times that I
call in-betweens.

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:05.117 align:middle line:84%
In-betweens are
when I'm not really

01:07:05.117 --> 01:07:06.450 align:middle line:90%
just focused right on something.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:07.783 align:middle line:90%
I've walked out of the meeting--

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Transition.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --walked
out of the meeting,

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back to my office.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.297 align:middle line:84%
I have 10 minutes
before I have to be

01:07:13.297 --> 01:07:14.380 align:middle line:90%
on the phone or something.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
That's an in-between time.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I go back to the ease
feeling in my in-betweens.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.419 align:middle line:84%
You know, sit down and
close my eyes and all that.

01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I just go-- start
breathing that ease feeling.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's there.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So I try
to keep sustaining it

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.688 align:middle line:84%
during the course of the
day so that it's there

01:07:29.688 --> 01:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
with me during the
course of the day.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And just to breathe that feeling
in and out through the heart.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, when I'm
in the middle of the activity,

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I can refer back to it again.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing that
in the interview.

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, you
really do need be focused,

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
you need to be on, you
need be conversational,

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
you've got to make decisions
and things like that.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can't
necessarily always be

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that in the forefront
of consciousness.

01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:52.500 align:middle line:90%
But I can go back to it.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
a lot of times for me, Lisa,

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.647 align:middle line:84%
I can tell whether I really
applied myself in that regard--

01:08:00.647 --> 01:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you don't
feel as stressful

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.146 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:06.511 align:middle line:84%
So this is a technique that
you can practice at home.

01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Please, do this at home.

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, please.

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is one of those
things, please do at home.

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.444 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice this
going in and out of ease, then

01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
the end of your day,
you get a lot more--

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Right, and
I can still be tired.

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.587 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And-- I'm sorry,
and you could also--

01:08:18.587 --> 01:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a difference between
ease and coherence, though,

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.420 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is more of
that optimal state.

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, ease is,
again, a technique that

01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:27.029 align:middle line:84%
creates more coherence
in your system.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:27.529 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:29.439 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If we were to
do the emWave right now,

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and you practiced
the ease technique,

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:34.649 align:middle line:84%
you'd very likely see your
coherence level increase.

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:37.399 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way-- part of
HeartMath is a system,

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not just to talk
about things conceptually,

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
it's to do things like have
techniques that then tie

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to technology so that you
have a package of things that

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.429 align:middle line:84%
makes sense, that give it a
comprehensive understanding

01:08:50.429 --> 01:08:51.720 align:middle line:90%
of what someone's trying to do.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to understand
the difference, though,

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
between relaxation
and coherence is

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
where relaxation is
something that you

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
could get a little
sleep, you relax.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.189 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is that optimal state
where you're at the beach,

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:10.529 align:middle line:84%
but you hear the
seagulls, you recognize

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
the rhythm of the
waves, you've got--

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.408 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of the people
and the things around you.

01:09:14.408 --> 01:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like that
field of peak-- of peakness.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.729 align:middle line:84%
And then you can transfer that
to a workplace, where you're

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
operating in a place of
coherence, where things are--

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
attract the things to you

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.779 align:middle line:90%
that you think about.

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:30.321 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole nother
level of being.

01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:31.279 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Relaxation's
trying to balance things out.

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:34.073 align:middle line:90%
And it's good.

01:09:34.073 --> 01:09:36.747 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all for anything
that takes people deeper

01:09:36.747 --> 01:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
within and helps
them today, including

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:39.969 align:middle line:90%
relaxation techniques.

01:09:39.969 --> 01:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is just something
that's different than that.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And you described it very well.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.685 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
to try to add to it

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:46.934 align:middle line:90%
from a descriptive standpoint.

01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:49.023 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
will say about it

01:09:49.023 --> 01:09:50.939 align:middle line:84%
that may sort of put a
period on that sentence

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is that we train athletes
in coherence building

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and training-- Olympic athletes,
professional golfers, PGA tour

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
golfers, kickers in football--
in professional football--

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
people like that.

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
those athletes to be

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
able to understand
that coherent state,

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
high-performance state.

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we're
in the middle of the activity

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.245 align:middle line:84%
that they're in that
they're thinking about that.

01:10:14.245 --> 01:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when they
use emWaves and practice

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
coherence-building techniques
is their natural coherence

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.426 align:middle line:90%
baseline increases.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, right?

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.220 align:middle line:90%
That's your practice.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: As they
practice, it increases.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.638 align:middle line:84%
And so they're operating--
where they start out

01:10:26.638 --> 01:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is at a different place
from where they were.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- to your point--
it is not just about relaxing,

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
it's about having a
casual, relaxed flow

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in a high-performance life.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, well,
but not only that,

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:40.748 align:middle line:84%
but this could help
with people who

01:10:40.748 --> 01:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
are stuck without finding
purpose in their life,

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
stuck in a dead-end job, to
get to that place of being

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
able to be switched on, to
fire the neurons moving,

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself out of that job
that you don't like, or find

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that new-- get yourself out
of the abusive relationship,

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.380 align:middle line:84%
or get yourself into
a place of health.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, you need
to change your eating habits

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
because your health
is being threatened,

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
get into that
optimal zone of what

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
it feels like to be in coherence
of eating healthy, feeling

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
clean, exercising, doing-- It
gets-- how many people can't

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:15.012 align:middle line:84%
get to the gym or wherever they
want to do with their exercise?

01:11:15.012 --> 01:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It will help you
get to that place.

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So coherence is more than
just a relaxation technique;

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.300 align:middle line:90%
it is the optimal state.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like Joseph
Chilton Pearce talks

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:26.950 align:middle line:90%
about the zone of kids at play.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Kids at play are in their
peak performance zone.

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I watch this all the
time with my daughter.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
In her imaginary play life, that
is her Olympic athlete state.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's the optimum
state for children.

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Coherence occurs
naturally in nature.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And it occurs in
things like children,

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
like you mentioned,
when you play.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things where
coherence shows up.

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can bring ourselves
back to that state more.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.347 align:middle line:90%
It's really our natural state.

01:11:55.347 --> 01:11:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And it's really
where we're supposed to be.

01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's returning
back to natural--

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.734 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you don't need
caffeine to get there.

01:12:02.734 --> 01:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And it's not trying
to take the fun out of life;

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just find-- finding
the flow of life.

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I said something
in the beginning of our time

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:14.289 align:middle line:84%
together, where I said that
when I was describing what heart

01:12:14.289 --> 01:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
meant to me, that it gave me
the ability to do what I usually

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:19.150 align:middle line:90%
can't or often can't.

01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And this-- now we've
gone through a lot

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of different subjects to reach
back around to this point,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
but that-- you said it well.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
This coherent state is
a state where we really

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.465 align:middle line:90%
are doing our very best.

01:12:30.465 --> 01:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the flow--

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's balance.

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the state of balance
everyone wants to achieve.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, so we've gone
through a lot of science

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
understanding to reach

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
some of these conclusions.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes a
matter of many people today

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and many people who probably
are watching the show,

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
they want to improve
their own lives,

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:47.410 align:middle line:90%
so they have needs there.

01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But they also want to
make a bigger contribution

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.400 align:middle line:90%
to the world itself.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.966 align:middle line:84%
There's an internal longingness
inside their own hearts,

01:12:52.966 --> 01:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
saying I want to make a
difference, I want to give.

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:55.881 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that's where we
talked about global coherence,

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
creating global
coherence in our project.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
But there are many projects.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But how do we contribute
energetically?

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So someone who does not
have the ability or time

01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to get involved in
anything specific

01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:13.620 align:middle line:84%
can still make a huge
contribution to the shift

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.335 align:middle line:84%
and to the world simply by
changing their own heart.

01:13:16.335 --> 01:13:17.626 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that interesting?

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: As the old saying
goes, a change of heart

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.400 align:middle line:90%
changes everything.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think at
HeartMath, we're showing

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that that's real from
physiological to psychological,

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
it's a real process.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.104 align:middle line:90%
And everybody can do that.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's the beauty of it.

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about my friend
Doc Childre and what he set up

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to create, it's like-- the
beautiful simplicity of it all,

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to
identify that we have made

01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
into a sophisticated system
with ways in which we offer

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.815 align:middle line:84%
this to people and businesses
and all kinds of things.

01:13:47.815 --> 01:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, through
our nonprofit, I mean,

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
just the work that they do
alone with kids and families,

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and through the membership
that they offer,

01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
it's just one part of HeartMath,
but it's such an important one,

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
science and all these things.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm
self-aggrandizing right now,

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really proud of
what HeartMath's done.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud to say that
the heart of HeartMath

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of all the
complexity and the growth

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:11.140 align:middle line:90%
is stronger than it's ever been.

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.431 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The heart of HeartMath?

01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The heart of
HeartMath, the real motivation

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and the mission that
we set out to do.

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the mission
is very important,

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.846 align:middle line:84%
and it's helping
people understand

01:14:19.846 --> 01:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that they can achieve
balance in their own lives

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and then they can
move away from stress

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
into a place of coherence.

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But what you said about being
the part of a bigger whole

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and about being
of service, it is

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
said that the best way to
self-healing is to help others.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
establishes coherence.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And thinking of
coherence as being

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.260 align:middle line:84%
in that place of
an optimal state

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
is a peak-performance
state is the best

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.500 align:middle line:90%
way that I can see it here.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's also being
in the heart space.

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:52.312 align:middle line:90%
And peace starts with yourself.

01:14:52.312 --> 01:14:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:54.982 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so if
you're going to start

01:14:54.982 --> 01:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
from that place of
peace and really

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
make a huge difference--
And the great thing,

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
you could look at Global
Coherence Initiative

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and see the difference that it's
making and look at the cycles

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
and so forth that it's making.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
That's great that you are able
to quantify something like that

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and that you put something
like that together.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.385 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, it is.

01:15:11.385 --> 01:15:12.926 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, I think, what's

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
most important about
it is that we're

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.926 align:middle line:84%
providing a place
that a lot of people

01:15:16.926 --> 01:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
can resonate with that
brings people together

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.244 align:middle line:90%
into a community.

01:15:20.244 --> 01:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Community is
another good point.

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Are people forming
communities around?

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.311 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, they are.

01:15:25.311 --> 01:15:27.644 align:middle line:84%
We've stayed out of trying
to orchestrate that.

01:15:27.644 --> 01:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
There's self-forming communities
of Global Coherence Initiative,

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
people around the world
who are finding each other,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
who are having their own
get-togethers and meetings,

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that, because they

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.380 align:middle line:84%
want to be a part
of something larger.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And community's
important right now.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.000 align:middle line:84%
People are looking for
cooperation and harmony.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, and community.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.490 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go from here?

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got these
great things going.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.252 align:middle line:90%
And what's next for HeartMath?

01:15:53.252 --> 01:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, I
think what's next

01:15:54.710 --> 01:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
for us is continuing to find
the best ways possible to get

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
whatever we have
to offer right now,

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.920 align:middle line:84%
because we're at a critical
juncture in history,

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and we are making choices today
that are going to have impact

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.894 align:middle line:90%
on our future for years to come.

01:16:07.894 --> 01:16:09.643 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
about the tipping point

01:16:09.643 --> 01:16:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that we're at, yeah.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This interview
is being recorded in 2011.

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.550 align:middle line:90%
People talk about 2012.

01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that choices
we're making today,

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
right here in this
moment, are the ones that

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
will be energized by
what happens in 2012.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:26.297 align:middle line:84%
So 2011, 2012, the
years right after that--

01:16:26.297 --> 01:16:27.380 align:middle line:90%
these are important times.

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Never before have we been
in such an important time.

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So at HeartMath what's next for
us is how do we better do that?

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.322 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving-- our
business models and things.

01:16:35.322 --> 01:16:37.905 align:middle line:84%
We're getting more into mobile
applications, an iPhone app, so

01:16:37.905 --> 01:16:38.340 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so cool.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So you could use your mobile
phone to obtain coherence?

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.376 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Eventually,
emWaves will be on phones.

01:16:45.376 --> 01:16:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And a lot
of things like that.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because they
usually distract you

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.828 align:middle line:90%
from that place of coherence.

01:16:50.828 --> 01:16:54.637 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and also just
getting more techniques out

01:16:54.637 --> 01:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
there through our training
programs and processes,

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.594 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

01:16:57.594 --> 01:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it's about--
it's-- we're very creative

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:01.370 align:middle line:90%
at HeartMath.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:02.828 align:middle line:84%
So, we can develop
many new things.

01:17:02.828 --> 01:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And we always have
that going on.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
how do we get better

01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:09.380 align:middle line:90%
at getting it to the people?

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
How do we get better at
disseminating what we have?

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:15.724 align:middle line:84%
And that involves how do
we have more people know

01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:16.640 align:middle line:90%
about us for starters.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It also involves how do we
get better at doing that?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we are better at being
a fully-functional nonprofit

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and a for-profit business.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
How do those systems work better
so that it's easier for people

01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.736 align:middle line:90%
to-- get what they need from us.

01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's some of the
thoughts that I have in my role

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
as a business person.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's not
so much about how

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
do we make more money,
but it's focusing

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:40.435 align:middle line:84%
on how do we get
better at serving

01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
the needs of our customers
and the people who

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
want to participate
in HeartMath.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it more
focused on the individual

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.955 align:middle line:84%
than it is focused on the
global aspects of it all?

01:17:49.955 --> 01:17:51.705 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: A lot of
it's on organizational.

01:17:51.705 --> 01:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our training
programs today

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
are happening in
health care systems.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Large health care institutions
are training their people

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.756 align:middle line:90%
in HeartMath.

01:17:58.756 --> 01:17:59.880 align:middle line:90%
That's one area that we do.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
military earlier--

01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Health care is great.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --and
things like that.

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
We have programs-- we're
still doing corporations

01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:06.060 align:middle line:90%
as well in corporate America.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
training process there;

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
it's in between, sort of,
the individual and then

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
the macro, the global.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.036 align:middle line:84%
There's an organizational
component in there as well.

01:18:15.036 --> 01:18:17.410 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned earlier, we
work a lot of different levels

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and layers at HeartMath
to get that job done.

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just think
that what's next

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:28.882 align:middle line:84%
for me is staying true to
what's guided me all along.

01:18:28.882 --> 01:18:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's two things.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.480 align:middle line:84%
One was that dedication early
in my life to continuous growth.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Continuous growth?

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And the other was
a dedication early in my life

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.620 align:middle line:90%
to service to others.

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.402 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I
keep doing that,

01:18:39.402 --> 01:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
then things will take
care of themselves.

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I keep following the
flow of my own heart.

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great model.

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:47.615 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we'll let
the rest unfold from there.

01:18:47.615 --> 01:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I stay
there, I'll be OK.

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's a time of
great opportunity

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and great challenge
for everybody,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and that includes me as well.

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, these
are wise solutions,

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
like what you have with
the HeartMath Solution.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of the
simplest technique

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can do with getting
in and aligning yourself

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
with that place of coherence
is the way to shift individuals

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and to obtain that
place of balance,

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and to start from the heart,
understanding now and seeing

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the science behind the fact
that the heart emits signals

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.791 align:middle line:84%
and receives signals
at the same time.

01:19:20.791 --> 01:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not all orchestrated
from the mind and the brain,

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
but it can be, and
that that then makes

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
a difference in our human
energy field, in our ionosphere,

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and affects the entire planet.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Great summary.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, I learned a lot.

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Good.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I thank
you so much, Howard.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You have made a
massive contribution

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
to the world of consciousness
and de-stressing people's

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.672 align:middle line:90%
lives, really.

01:19:44.672 --> 01:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
I'm so appreciative

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and really humbled about the
opportunities that I do have.

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:54.107 align:middle line:84%
And because it didn't have
to be this way for me.

01:19:54.107 --> 01:19:56.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things that
have taken place in my life

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.827 align:middle line:84%
that I have to see as
grace and as a gift.

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:00.285 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
things like being

01:20:00.285 --> 01:20:02.544 align:middle line:84%
able to have a time with
you to be on a program

01:20:02.544 --> 01:20:03.710 align:middle line:90%
like Gaiam's producing here.

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate
that as well.

01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And what motivates me
today is to say, well,

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
if these kind of
things can happen

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to me-- not everybody's
going to be on TV--

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
but if I can find fulfillment
that exceeded my expectation,

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.690 align:middle line:90%
then others can as well.

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want for people.

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I do what I do.

01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm glad we've
exceeded your expectations.

01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:23.161 align:middle line:90%
You have as well.

01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
the impact that you've made.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.451 align:middle line:84%
And I know that people
will be inspired from this

01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and understand that it's
very easy to obtain coherence

01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
to obtain balance.

01:20:32.690 --> 01:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Lisa, you
take care, darling.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.261 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

01:20:35.261 --> 01:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks, Howard.

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:39.872 align:middle line:90%
