[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.055 align:middle line:10%
Hello, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.625 align:middle line:10%
Did you know the ancient
science of numerology

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:10%
is 2,500 years old?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.897 align:middle line:10%
And it's been used for centuries
to help people determine

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.031 align:middle line:10%
their life's purpose,
their wedding date,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.301 align:middle line:10%
and even to find a
relationship match.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:37.504 align:middle line:10%
This is what my guest did
today to find her soul mate.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.007 align:middle line:10%
My guess is numerologist
Glynis McCants,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.709 align:middle line:10%
and she's known to many
as The Numbers Lady.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.646 align:middle line:10%
She has helped thousands
of people over the past two

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:10%
decades recognize their
strengths and their weaknesses

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.654 align:middle line:10%
and follow their path to join,
even really change their lives,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.322 align:middle line:10%
all by the numbers.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Glynis.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.424 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Hi.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.492 align:middle line:10%
Very good to be here.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:00:59.793 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with me.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:84%
You really are a genius
when it comes to numbers.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.464 align:middle line:84%
And I want to-- I ask
you, I mean, two decades

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.233 align:middle line:84%
you've been working with this.
-Yes.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.502 align:middle line:90%
Is that practice makes perfect?

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:09.303 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you really--

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.204 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: I
have to tell you--

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell
you a couple things,

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.741 align:middle line:10%
that the actual science
I use is Pythagoras'

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:10%
system, because there's others.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.345 align:middle line:10%
And I really embrace his.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.714 align:middle line:10%
It's been the most
accurate for me.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.349 align:middle line:10%
Numerology itself is
the sense of numbers.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.117 align:middle line:10%
It is 2,500 years old.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.986 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras was the
creator of the system.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:28.121 align:middle line:10%
And the belief is that
everything in the universe

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:10%
has vibration, and that's
why when you meet someone,

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.392 align:middle line:10%
you're like, oh, I really
enjoyed that person.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.428 align:middle line:84%
Or you meet someone, say,
OK, that didn't feel good.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.363 align:middle line:84%
Like, you might even
feel a little drained.

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.731 align:middle line:90%
That's all energy.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.765 align:middle line:10%
So in the case of how
long I've done it,

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.202 align:middle line:10%
I can honestly tell
you, the first time

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.172 align:middle line:10%
I did someone's numbers just for
the heck of it, I was accurate.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.606 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I
knew it was God given.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.977 align:middle line:10%
So I-- I attribute my gift
as being very God given.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle line:10%
I'm an excellent
interpreter of numbers.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.513 align:middle line:10%
Like, we can all do numerology.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.583 align:middle line:10%
But I'm a really good
interpreter of what it means.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.584 align:middle line:10%
And that is the difference.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.287 align:middle line:10%
That's why I got the
nickname The Numbers Lady.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:01.054 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's true.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you are.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.924 align:middle line:10%
You said once, the
numbers don't lie.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.525 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
could she say that?

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.527 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a bold statement.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.662 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.097 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: They do not lie.
Right.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:10.797 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.467 align:middle line:84%
But what it means is, again,
it comes to interpretation.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.335 align:middle line:10%
When I say that, it's
because the reason

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.304 align:middle line:10%
we lie sometimes as
people is we panic.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.071 align:middle line:10%
We feel uncomfortable.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:10%
We feel like you're judging us.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:21.341 align:middle line:10%
But numbers are just numbers.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.876 align:middle line:10%
So what's beautiful
is when you understand

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.545 align:middle line:10%
each other by numbers, you don't
take it personally anymore.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:10%
So you might be husband
and wife and say, oh,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.048 align:middle line:10%
she's being a four.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:29.616 align:middle line:10%
Oh, he's being a five.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:10%
Now it's not personal.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.918 align:middle line:10%
It's is vibration.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.353 align:middle line:10%
And that's the beauty of
understanding why it's so good.

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:36.055 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't have
to lie because it's

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.024 align:middle line:10%
not defending itself.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.026 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's actually--
I mean, an example of that

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:10%
is my daughter and
I. In our charts,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.596 align:middle line:10%
our numbers are not compatible.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.866 align:middle line:84%
We struggle sometimes when it
comes to getting homework done

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.134 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE] done.

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:48.602 align:middle line:90%
But I'm able to look at that.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.437 align:middle line:10%
Because I have so
much love for her,

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.573 align:middle line:10%
but when we had those struggles,
it would really break my heart.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.777 align:middle line:10%
But when I saw that our
charts, we would never

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.478 align:middle line:10%
be a compatible relationship--

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.914 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Now remember,
it's about challenge,

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't mean you
can't coexist beautifully.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I've come across couples

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.622 align:middle line:84%
that were considered challenged,
but they get along great.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.158 align:middle line:84%
But it was because of
their own evolvement.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.226 align:middle line:10%
You know, what causes a
breakdown in communication,

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.028 align:middle line:10%
it always takes two to tango.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't join in the
fight, there can't be a fight.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.198 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Exactly.
That's how it works.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.699 align:middle line:84%
And that's your lesson.
Yeah.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.834 align:middle line:84%
So take me back
to a relationship

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that you said wasn't working for
you, and how you got into this.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.638 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Oh, yeah.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:10%
When I first got
into it, I was 19.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.475 align:middle line:10%
My heart was broken.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:10%
I went to see someone
who was a numerologist.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.045 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know what
that meant, of course.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.148 align:middle line:10%
And she explained to me, she
goes, you're not missing him.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:35.849 align:middle line:10%
You miss his mother.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:10%
You miss his sister.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.418 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
their vibration

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.553 align:middle line:10%
is naturally matched to you.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh, interesting.
-Isn't it?

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the minute she said
it, it clicked for me.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
I'm not missing him.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.526 align:middle line:90%
And I was over him.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.463 align:middle line:84%
Which is nuts, because for
two years I mourned us.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.197 align:middle line:10%
I mourned us.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.531 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't-- I just didn't
know what I was morning.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.301 align:middle line:10%
And she explained,
you're mourning them.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.203 align:middle line:10%
When you go in the house, you
feel like you belong there.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.005 align:middle line:10%
So to this day, I'm friends
with his mom and his sister.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.073 align:middle line:10%
And to me--
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:00.774 align:middle line:10%
Really?

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:03.143 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I'm buddies with them,
because they really were

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:04.377 align:middle line:10%
meant to be a part of my life.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:06.246 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.382 align:middle line:84%
So how did you find
your-- then your--

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.851 align:middle line:84%
-My guy?
-Yeah.

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:13.019 align:middle line:10%
I-- here I was,
coaching the whole world

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.621 align:middle line:10%
to find great love
by the numbers,

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.789 align:middle line:10%
and I'm like, wait a second.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:10%
What about me?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.427 align:middle line:10%
And I'd actually been in
a bad marriage early on.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.529 align:middle line:10%
And I ignored some stuff.

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:23.663 align:middle line:10%
Now this is interesting.

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.166 align:middle line:10%
He, my husband, was compatible,
but his whole family

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.134 align:middle line:10%
was a challenge to me.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:10%
So it can go that
way too, darling.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.536 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh, your
current husband?

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:31.138 align:middle line:10%
No, ex-husband.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.339 align:middle line:10%
I was married once before.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.306 align:middle line:10%
I'm telling you that.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:36.009 align:middle line:10%
What you need to be aware
of is even if you're

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.277 align:middle line:10%
compatible with your
partner, when you

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.246 align:middle line:10%
marry, you marry the family.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.046 align:middle line:10%
Uh-huh.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.082 align:middle line:10%
And this new-- my husband
of 10 years, the man I've

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.919 align:middle line:10%
been with 10 years, not only
are we beyond compatible,

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.654 align:middle line:10%
but I adore his children.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.922 align:middle line:10%
He's got two daughters.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.457 align:middle line:10%
I count them as my own.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.927 align:middle line:10%
And his mother is like
the angel mother-in-law.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:55.629 align:middle line:10%
Like, she's my favorite human.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.297 align:middle line:10%
And she's best friends
with my mother.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.966 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the most
magical story by the numbers.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:84%
So--
-Isn't that nice?

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:01.868 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.971 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said,
knowledge is the power here.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.306 align:middle line:10%
The more you can learn
about each other,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.575 align:middle line:10%
the better you can do,
no matter what you're in.

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.243 align:middle line:10%
But if you're single,
I'd want to help you get

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.545 align:middle line:10%
it right from the
start, and that's why

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:12.913 align:middle line:10%
I wrote "Love by the Numbers."

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:14.748 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And that's
an amazing book.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.383 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how the numbers

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.486 align:middle line:84%
would relate to something
like this year we're-- 2012.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.187 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes.

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.355 align:middle line:84%
And people can look at
their experience of it

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.356 align:middle line:90%
and relate all of it.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.191 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah, OK.

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.359 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you do when
you look at a world number

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.694 align:middle line:90%
is you have to break it down.

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.563 align:middle line:10%
So 2012.

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:10%
2 plus 0 plus 1 plus 2 is 5.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.336 align:middle line:10%
Now a five, energy is
never a dull moment.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.571 align:middle line:10%
It moves too quickly.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.906 align:middle line:10%
Like, it's very hard
to keep up with things.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:10%
So I know that George Noory is
also on your wonderful channel.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.679 align:middle line:10%
And George and I
talk quite a bit.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.514 align:middle line:10%
We always check in
every couple months

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:10%
just to compare notes of
what I said and what happens.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.152 align:middle line:10%
So I said in the beginning of
year to him in January, I said,

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:52.886 align:middle line:10%
look.

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.354 align:middle line:10%
This year's going to
be full speed ahead.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.156 align:middle line:10%
Grab your bag of
popcorn, because it's

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:57.591 align:middle line:10%
going to be like a movie.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.893 align:middle line:10%
I mean, sometimes
it'll feel surreal.

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.428 align:middle line:10%
I said, but just
keep your focus.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:02.762 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to
accomplish something,

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.798 align:middle line:10%
you've got to sit down
and write it down.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:10%
Make a list of what it is
you're trying to achieve.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.568 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, it's not
going to happen.

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast the
year would move.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.038 align:middle line:84%
And haven't you felt
the speed of this year?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.139 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Exceptionally.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.274 align:middle line:90%
Like, crazy, right?

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.076 align:middle line:84%
-Exceptionally, yes.
-Right.

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:17.911 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it works.

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:18.945 align:middle line:10%
And that was the world number.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.947 align:middle line:10%
And now we saw a lot of drama.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.449 align:middle line:10%
To me, symbolic.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.119 align:middle line:10%
In the January-- do you remember
the cruise ship that capsized?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.021 align:middle line:10%
Think back to that.

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:28.955 align:middle line:10%
That was in January.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:32.859 align:middle line:10%
And that represented to me
the cycle of five for drama.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.829 align:middle line:10%
Who-- you never see a
capsized cruise ship.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.297 align:middle line:10%
The captain was showing off.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:39.499 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to get close
to shore, and they ran

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.933 align:middle line:10%
aground, thank you very much.

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:41.935 align:middle line:10%
And then what did he do?

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.603 align:middle line:10%
He jumps off the cruise ship.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.273 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to stay while
people were still there.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So my point is that was like a
little message to me to go, OK.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.144 align:middle line:10%
Fasten your seat belts.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Do you
look at everything--

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.414 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Everything.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.117 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's political, of
course, I look at politics.

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:58.784 align:middle line:10%
Every time I read a
story, whether it's

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:01.154 align:middle line:10%
a celebrity, anything
that happens,

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:10%
my brain runs, of
course, to Google

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.257 align:middle line:10%
trying to find the birthday.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.025 align:middle line:10%
It's because, remember.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.726 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you won't
get the right birthday.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.828 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty good at
continuing to research,

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:09.963 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of
celebrities don't

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:11.464 align:middle line:10%
want to admit their birthday.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.034 align:middle line:10%
So again, numbers don't lie.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:16.136 align:middle line:10%
But if the number's wrong,
if I've got the wrong number,

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.271 align:middle line:10%
that's not right either, right?
But, yeah.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.406 align:middle line:10%
I do, every single day.

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to
say something else.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.244 align:middle line:10%
In February, remember
Whitney Houston died.

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:25.045 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh, yes.

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:27.347 align:middle line:10%
And now what's interesting
about how fast this year moved,

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:30.116 align:middle line:10%
it's almost like that seemed
an awful long time ago.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.785 align:middle line:10%
Like, it doesn't seem
it was this year, right?

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.652 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: No, it doesn't.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:35.155 align:middle line:84%
This year moved so quickly
with so much happening.

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.823 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: But listen
to this powerful story,

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle line:84%
because again, I look
at number patterns.

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.494 align:middle line:84%
Whitney was a nine life
path, which is the old soul.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.496 align:middle line:10%
It's the one who comes to
it with a lot of gifts.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:46.232 align:middle line:10%
And you know, no one had a
better voice than Whitney.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.902 align:middle line:10%
Well, when Whitney
passed away, the next day

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.003 align:middle line:10%
was the Grammys, remember?

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:51.304 align:middle line:10%
She was going to perform.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.273 align:middle line:10%
It was the 54th Grammys.

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:55.141 align:middle line:10%
5 plus 4 is 9.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.645 align:middle line:10%
And then that night,
Adele won six Grammys.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.046 align:middle line:10%
She's a nine life path.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.515 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like this
baton was passed.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:10%
Whitney the nine passed the
baton to Adele, the nine.

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:10%
And it was a nine,
the actual day.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.356 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just-- I look
at stuff like that

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:10%
and go-- that's all I do.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.359 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's a
great example, actually.

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.059 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.695 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of you
on "The Dr. Phil Show,"

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.263 align:middle line:90%
which was an amazing thing.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:19.866 align:middle line:84%
You took the crew
out to a bar, right?

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.101 align:middle line:84%
Well, no.
No, no, no.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:21.835 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I did.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.736 align:middle line:10%
I challenged them.

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle line:10%
I said, you know,
I know that there's

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:10%
no such thing as a stranger
if I've got their number.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.242 align:middle line:10%
I said, so I'd like the
opportunity to do that.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.211 align:middle line:10%
So they literally had
me go into a nightclub

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:32.611 align:middle line:10%
and read perfect strangers.

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.347 align:middle line:10%
And also, we did a
lot of shoot that day

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.384 align:middle line:10%
like at coffee shops and stuff,
and it was dead on accurate.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:41.453 align:middle line:10%
So the beauty of what they did
is they showed it on television

00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:42.621 align:middle line:10%
and just said, there it is.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.525 align:middle line:10%
And it was all-- I knew
nobody, proving it.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.293 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Let's take
a look at that clip.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.128 align:middle line:90%
It's in the numbers.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.162 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:84%
There are other
ways to determine

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.065 align:middle line:90%
whether two people are a match.

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.567 align:middle line:84%
Now my next guest
certainly thinks so.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.136 align:middle line:84%
She calls herself
The Numbers Lady.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:56.836 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.874 align:middle line:10%
The most important number--
and this is for all of you--

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.776 align:middle line:10%
it's your life path number.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:05.345 align:middle line:10%
One means you're striving to
be the best at what to do.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.213 align:middle line:10%
A six is the nurturing number.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.181 align:middle line:10%
You're a six.

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:11.084 align:middle line:10%
The number seven is the
observer watching others.

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:11.885 align:middle line:10%
Hi, seven.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:12.986 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.387 align:middle line:10%
And the eight is, don't
mind working hard.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.955 align:middle line:10%
Where's my paycheck?
Hi, eight.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.824 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:20.293 align:middle line:10%
And the nine is, follow me.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.694 align:middle line:10%
And I might not know
what I'm doing now,

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.029 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to pull if off.
Hi, nine.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.031 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.268 align:middle line:10%
Well, please welcome author
of "Love by the Numbers,"

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:30.103 align:middle line:10%
Glynis McCants to the show.
-Thank you.

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:31.037 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.374 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:36.075 align:middle line:90%
Now tell me how this works.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.144 align:middle line:84%
Numerology is the
science of numbers.

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.513 align:middle line:10%
When you look at someone's
name and their birth date,

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:43.883 align:middle line:10%
you get six numbers that make
up the numerology blueprint

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:44.884 align:middle line:10%
of who they are.

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.087 align:middle line:84%
And just for the record, you're
soul mates with your wife.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.657 align:middle line:10%
So Robin and you are an example
of a soul mate connection,

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.825 align:middle line:10%
for real.
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:52.725 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:84%
So our numbers--
-I knew that.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.797 align:middle line:84%
We've been together
for 40 years,

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:59.632 align:middle line:90%
but our numbers say that, right?

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.567 align:middle line:90%
The numbers do.

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:01.534 align:middle line:90%
And here's how that works.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.269 align:middle line:84%
Because 40 would be the
biggest of those numbers, right?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.504 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but let me
tell you about you.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.406 align:middle line:84%
You're a seven life path, and
you know what seven's are?

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:07.674 align:middle line:84%
It means you can
assess the situation,

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.275 align:middle line:90%
and you feel who people are.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.677 align:middle line:90%
You do it all the time.

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.846 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, your
greatest blessing--

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.881 align:middle line:84%
you've got the number
two, which is intuition.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.449 align:middle line:84%
You do go with
that gut instinct,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't fail you.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.553 align:middle line:10%
Going back to Robin, she
is actually your rock.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:10%
Your rock.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:10%
Because a four is that
solid base that says,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.425 align:middle line:10%
honey, fly as high
as you can fly.

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:27.627 align:middle line:84%
But make sure you
take care of me too.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.628 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget me.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.963 align:middle line:90%
Because the four's about family.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.298 align:middle line:84%
So her mission is about,
make sure the whole family

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
is together, and you
love that about her.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.336 align:middle line:84%
So if I come home and express
an opinion and she says,

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:37.604 align:middle line:90%
don't you Dr. Phil me--

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:39.506 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:90%
You need to listen to me.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.407 align:middle line:90%
Is that her being my rock?

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely phenomenal.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.278 align:middle line:84%
You got a huge response
from that, didn't do?

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:10%
Well, actually,
here's what's great.

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.748 align:middle line:10%
I actually picked the
date by the numbers,

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.617 align:middle line:10%
and they let it air
the day I asked.

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:51.384 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh, you did?

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:52.218 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I did.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:54.754 align:middle line:10%
Because I-- they do trust--
I am The Numbers Lady.

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.724 align:middle line:10%
And I-- PS, it was a high
rated show, which is the whole

00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:58.691 align:middle line:10%
point of picking a date--

00:10:58.691 --> 00:10:59.626 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh, that's great.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:00.326 align:middle line:10%
--if you can.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.496 align:middle line:10%
But it was 12/3/2012.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.266 align:middle line:10%
And that energy, the three
day-- I'm a double three

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:08.668 align:middle line:10%
numerology born on a three
day, three life path.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.436 align:middle line:10%
So that day's communication.

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.871 align:middle line:10%
And the whole-- the
attitude of the day

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.106 align:middle line:10%
was six, which is magnetic.

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.574 align:middle line:10%
People would be drawn to it.

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:16.276 align:middle line:10%
And then the whole date
reduced to one digit,

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.144 align:middle line:10%
which was the master
number 11, which

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.413 align:middle line:10%
is this doorway of knowledge.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.648 align:middle line:10%
So I knew it would
be really good.

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:23.516 align:middle line:10%
But here's what
happened on my website.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.118 align:middle line:10%
I got a call from
the webmaster saying,

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:26.819 align:middle line:10%
what the heck did you just do?
I said, why?

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.388 align:middle line:10%
He says, your
website's going nuts,

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:29.556 align:middle line:10%
but it's actually
kind of freezing.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.823 align:middle line:10%
I said, why?

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:35.094 align:middle line:10%
He says, you're averaging 4,000
unique visitors per second.

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.529 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Per second?
-Per second.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.463 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
That's a powerful show.

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:38.398 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:39.699 align:middle line:90%
But you know what is so cool?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.833 align:middle line:90%
I love the hunger.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.503 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just lovely when
you get to show what you do,

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:44.837 align:middle line:84%
and people go, ooh,
I want to know more.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:45.538 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, are you a
consultant to the--

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.475 align:middle line:10%
to executives, celebrities?

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: I'll
tell you what I do.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.612 align:middle line:10%
I do have a lot of
celebrity clients,

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:56.015 align:middle line:10%
and I do corporate parties where
I help people like corporations

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:10%
get along better.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.652 align:middle line:10%
Look, the key is, how do
we get along better to come

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.354 align:middle line:10%
out with a positive result?

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:02.755 align:middle line:10%
That's what I do.
Yeah.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.556 align:middle line:10%
All the time.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.058 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: All right.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.392 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
some of the numbers.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.994 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about
how we determine

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:10.196 align:middle line:10%
our own life's path number.

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:10.964 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: OK.

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:14.033 align:middle line:84%
So let's say-- let's
do a birthday example.

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:18.404 align:middle line:10%
It would be 5/5/1962.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.506 align:middle line:10%
And we confirm that
that would be true.

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.276 align:middle line:10%
5/5/1962.

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:10%
Someone born that day.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.713 align:middle line:10%
What you would do is just
add it straight across.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:27.847 align:middle line:10%
So let's count with me.
Ready?

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.415 align:middle line:10%
5 plus 5.
LISA GARR: 10.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.017 align:middle line:10%
Plus 1.
LISA GARR: 11.

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.285 align:middle line:10%
Plus 9.
LISA GARR: 20.

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:34.287 align:middle line:10%
Yep.
Plus 6.

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:36.222 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: 26.
-And plus 2.

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.357 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: 28.
-That's right.

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:38.257 align:middle line:10%
So 28.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:41.127 align:middle line:10%
In numerology, for the purpose
of the simple definition

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:43.329 align:middle line:10%
of one through nine, you
just break it to one digit.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:46.566 align:middle line:10%
So 2 plus 8 is
10, 1 plus 0 is 1.

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:49.869 align:middle line:10%
So a one life path is someone
who's ambitious and driven.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:52.105 align:middle line:10%
They strive to be number
one at what they do.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.273 align:middle line:10%
That is the life
path, number one.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:56.175 align:middle line:10%
And for people listening
right now, some of them

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:10%
will say, well, what about me?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.544 align:middle line:10%
I'm a master number.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.447 align:middle line:10%
You know, master
number 11 or 22.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.116 align:middle line:10%
I would say, for
the purpose of what

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:10%
we're doing, to refer to the
two and the four respectively.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.055 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: So add them
together to create one.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:10%
To let it be a two for
this simple definition,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.227 align:middle line:10%
and let the 22 be a four
for the simple definition.

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:15.194 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: OK.
All right.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.429 align:middle line:10%
So we'll do that for now.
All right.

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:19.599 align:middle line:10%
So I want to run through-- so
I invite everyone listening who

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.801 align:middle line:10%
just saw how to do
the numbers, you add

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.969 align:middle line:10%
your whole birth date together.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.003 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go through--

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:25.271 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: And
reduce it to one digit.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So no matter where you end
up, if it's still two digits,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.341 align:middle line:84%
keep going.
-OK,

00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:29.042 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:31.177 align:middle line:84%
What is, if you've done
that now, what is a two?

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:34.013 align:middle line:10%
A two life path, they
seek love, peace, harmony.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.848 align:middle line:10%
They really are
the ones for love.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:38.117 align:middle line:10%
A three life path
is a communicator.

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.886 align:middle line:10%
They're here to
express themselves,

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.287 align:middle line:10%
and motivate and uplift others.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:43.389 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And you mention that
there's a positive and negative

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:44.424 align:middle line:10%
to each number.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Correct.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:45.625 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
negative in a sec.

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll just continue
with the positive,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.494 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
about that good news.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.099 align:middle line:84%
The number four
seeks knowledge.

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:54.233 align:middle line:90%
So they're here to teach us.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.269 align:middle line:84%
Like, once they learn, they
want to show you how to do it.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.705 align:middle line:10%
The number five is all about
freedom, fun, adventure.

00:13:58.705 --> 00:13:59.672 align:middle line:10%
You do not control a five.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:00.773 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well,
we're putting up

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:01.808 align:middle line:90%
the numbers on the screen here.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.443 align:middle line:84%
So the five is-- you
don't control this person.

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.343 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: You cannot.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.478 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Thus, the 2012.

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:06.379 align:middle line:10%
Uh-huh.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.047 align:middle line:10%
The number six, it's magnetic.

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:08.981 align:middle line:90%
They're the ones in charge.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:11.317 align:middle line:84%
It's considered a
nurturing energy.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.952 align:middle line:10%
The number seven,
they're the ones who have

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.954 align:middle line:10%
to-- they ask big questions.
Who am I?

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.322 align:middle line:10%
What am I?
Why am I here?

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:18.725 align:middle line:10%
So they need space, but
they also need to find

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.259 align:middle line:10%
faith that they can believe in.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.394 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: So the
seven is someone

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:22.562 align:middle line:10%
who asks, why am I here?

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:23.529 align:middle line:10%
But they need to trust--

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.697 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: They have
to get those answers.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.665 align:middle line:90%
They have to get the answers.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:26.966 align:middle line:90%
But they don't like hypocrisy.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.367 align:middle line:90%
Are they big why people?

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.068 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%
But also, they just are bored.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.672 align:middle line:10%
Like, if you try to
sell them on something,

00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:10%
their eyes roll to the
back of their head.

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.142 align:middle line:10%
But if it's interesting,
then they're intrigued,

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:37.076 align:middle line:10%
and they're listening.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.377 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: If it
grabs their attention.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.178 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:42.048 align:middle line:10%
The number eight, it's about
mastering money, establishing

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.584 align:middle line:10%
financial security, and
also learning to choose

00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:45.685 align:middle line:10%
their words carefully.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Because sometimes when
an eight gets upset,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.387 align:middle line:10%
they'll just say it.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.655 align:middle line:10%
They'll say how they feel.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:50.923 align:middle line:10%
It's a very honest energy.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's me.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.692 align:middle line:90%
I'm an eight.

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:54.293 align:middle line:84%
Very honest.
Uh-huh.

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:58.765 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to--
here's the irony of an eight.

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.633 align:middle line:10%
If someone gets
upset with the eight,

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.568 align:middle line:10%
they walk away very hurt.
It's like, whoa.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.337 align:middle line:10%
That's not what I meant at all.

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:06.239 align:middle line:10%
I was just trying to be honest.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.142 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: It's interesting
too, because I censor myself too

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.511 align:middle line:10%
because I wind up saying
most of it to myself,

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:12.411 align:middle line:10%
and don't let a lot of it--

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.513 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS:
Right, but let me

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:14.714 align:middle line:10%
tell you where that comes from.

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:17.517 align:middle line:10%
Even though we're doing these
simple examples of a life path,

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:19.352 align:middle line:10%
you're talking
about who you are.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.521 align:middle line:10%
You were born on what day?

00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.422 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: The 29th.
-Uh-huh.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.324 align:middle line:10%
2 plus 9 is 11, 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.927 align:middle line:10%
2 is sensitive to everybody.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.462 align:middle line:10%
So the day you're
born is the editor.

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:10%
Not your eight, honey.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.498 align:middle line:84%
If you were double
eight, whoo hoo!

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:33.366 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:34.734 align:middle line:90%
So it breaks down that much.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:35.434 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.803 align:middle line:84%
Your two is going,
I'm going to watch.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:38.538 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are three
numbers in the birth date,

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:40.072 align:middle line:90%
and that's more complicated.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:43.509 align:middle line:84%
Hence the reason I wrote a book
called "Love by the Numbers."

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.111 align:middle line:10%
But back to just
that basic number,

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.646 align:middle line:10%
you know that that's
a part of you.

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.614 align:middle line:10%
And you know, sometimes
if you get tired,

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.915 align:middle line:10%
Lisa, you won't edit.

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:53.286 align:middle line:10%
You'll just say it, and that's
when the problems can happen.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:53.986 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:55.988 align:middle line:10%
The number nine is
the humanitarian.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.824 align:middle line:84%
They have to learn
to let go of the past

00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:59.358 align:middle line:90%
to be happy in the moment.

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.327 align:middle line:10%
But they're a natural leader.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:02.395 align:middle line:10%
So that's our life path number.

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:03.629 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then
what about the 11?

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.464 align:middle line:90%
These master numbers, OK.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:08.067 align:middle line:10%
If you're a master
number 11 or 22,

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:10.703 align:middle line:10%
it just means you feel
called to master your life.

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.905 align:middle line:10%
The reason I talk about--
I call that a very

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle line:10%
high frequency vibration.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.877 align:middle line:10%
By having that, they can often
have, like, panic attacks.

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.245 align:middle line:10%
It can mess with sleep,
because they feel

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.646 align:middle line:10%
like they're not getting there.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:10%
And no matter how
much they achieve,

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:25.318 align:middle line:10%
they feel frustrated, like
they're not there yet.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.752 align:middle line:10%
And I give them
permission to say,

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.154 align:middle line:10%
embrace that lower frequency.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.622 align:middle line:10%
That's a part of you too.

00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:10%
Like, you've got your 11,
which is this-- you know,

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.793 align:middle line:10%
the voice says, no matter
how good, not good enough.

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:36.128 align:middle line:10%
That's what that voice says
that they have to overcome.

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.597 align:middle line:10%
So if they just
[INAUDIBLE] it into two,

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:40.466 align:middle line:10%
it means I'm also here just
for love, peace, harmony.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:10%
The 22, they're
also very intense.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.436 align:middle line:10%
They're about truth.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.571 align:middle line:10%
So if you're not honest,
they're going to confront you.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.607 align:middle line:10%
But the other thing they
can do is embrace a 2.

00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:50.776 align:middle line:10%
2 plus 2 is 4, and four
means when I learn my skill

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.411 align:middle line:10%
and learn how to do it
right, I'm going to help

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.513 align:middle line:10%
you so your life is easier.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:10%
That's their form of mastery.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:56.849 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
their mastery, yes.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.484 align:middle line:84%
And I do, again,
cover that thoroughly.

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:84%
But I just-- there are
people who love numerology,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:01.988 align:middle line:90%
and they get upset.

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.123 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you don't talk
enough about master numbers.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.892 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's not the point.

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:08.994 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to make you have a
better life, a happier life.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.063 align:middle line:10%
don't want you feel like
you're-- you didn't master it.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:11.763 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:12.632 align:middle line:10%
No, that's right.

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:14.567 align:middle line:10%
The book, you can find
all of the details,

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:10%
the little nuances.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.836 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: And by
the way, you have that.

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:20.873 align:middle line:84%
When I talked about 29, before
you got to that 2, 2 plus 9

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:90%
is 11.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.776 align:middle line:84%
So you have that voice,
no matter how good,

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.311 align:middle line:84%
not good enough.
You are very self-critical.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh.
-See?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.114 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Definitely.

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.048 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's your piece.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.117 align:middle line:10%
Now I have it also.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:33.586 align:middle line:10%
My attitude number, 8, 12.

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.354 align:middle line:10%
When you break it down, it's 11.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.122 align:middle line:10%
That's a master number.

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:37.256 align:middle line:10%
So I get it.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.824 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I have
compassion to it.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.393 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah.
You understand it.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:84%
So now, you mentioned there
were shadows-- not shadows.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.062 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: There is.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.829 align:middle line:90%
A dark side.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.032 align:middle line:84%
What it is, you're got a
positive and negative side

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:46.966 align:middle line:90%
to every number.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:49.769 align:middle line:10%
A one life path
living on the negative

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:52.204 align:middle line:10%
is too critical of
themselves, and then way too

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.406 align:middle line:10%
critical of everyone
in their life.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.507 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And by
the way, I want

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:10%
to just reframe that the idea
of going after what the negative

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:10%
is--

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.879 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: --is when
you fall into that trap.

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:01.514 align:middle line:84%
You can say, I'm not
going to do that anymore.

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:03.649 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to now go positive.
You'll say, ooh.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.117 align:middle line:84%
I fell into the
negative side of me.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.652 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
back to positive.

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:09.422 align:middle line:84%
And that I'm susceptible
to that negative side of me.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.124 align:middle line:10%
We are all-- and that's
why, by the way, when you run

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:15.394 align:middle line:10%
a chart for someone, if you're
supposed to be compatible,

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.997 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell you-- this
is important people know this.

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.967 align:middle line:10%
If they do drugs or
alcohol, all bets are off.

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:22.935 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if your
numbers are perfect.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.237 align:middle line:10%
You are dealing with
Doctor Jekyll, Mr. Hyde.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:27.006 align:middle line:10%
And it's not-- it's
going to suffer.

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:29.175 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: So the worst shadow
will come out and amplify.

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.476 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS:
That's exactly right.

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:10%
So then the number
two, two, the downside

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.847 align:middle line:10%
is being too sensitive.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.848 align:middle line:10%
Always hurt.

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.017 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's a lot
of work to be around.

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:40.219 align:middle line:10%
The number three
is a funny thing.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.254 align:middle line:10%
I say threes are
great communicators,

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.889 align:middle line:10%
but sometimes they embellish.

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:45.658 align:middle line:10%
They make up stories that
didn't really happen,

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:46.659 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly they buy it.

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:47.493 align:middle line:10%
They believe it.

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.694 align:middle line:10%
So they have to careful.

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.896 align:middle line:10%
Everything they're
saying's the truth.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.164 align:middle line:10%
You know, like,
I make this joke.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.934 align:middle line:10%
I say, the truth's not
always as entertaining.

00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:55.634 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:56.936 align:middle line:10%
So they'd better pay
attention to that.

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It's just-- and
little kids, if you

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.506 align:middle line:10%
meet a little three life path,
they will tell you stories.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.575 align:middle line:10%
And you can giggle, because
they're a little kid.

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:04.844 align:middle line:10%
But as an adult, three is
like, make sure you know.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:07.446 align:middle line:10%
And also be careful
not to over talk.

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:08.748 align:middle line:10%
They like to be
in the know, they

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.383 align:middle line:10%
like the gossip and the scoop.

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:12.151 align:middle line:10%
Be careful you're not
doing harm with what

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.652 align:middle line:10%
comes out of your mouth.
LISA GARR: I'm sure.

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.121 align:middle line:10%
And it's hard for
them to control that.

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:16.822 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Absolutely.
Because they're communications.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:90%
I know people like that.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure everyone does.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.861 align:middle line:10%
And then the four
life path, the thing

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:25.064 align:middle line:10%
with them is once, if you lie
to them, it's a deal breaker.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:27.033 align:middle line:10%
So if they choose
to let someone who

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:28.768 align:middle line:10%
lied to them stay in their
life, they'll bully them.

00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:29.935 align:middle line:10%
Like, I can't
believe you did that.

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe
you-- it's like, hey.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.005 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to
forgive them, then you've

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.541 align:middle line:10%
got to forgive them if you're
letting them stay in your life.

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.842 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, let them go.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.578 align:middle line:10%
So they're just very strong
in what they believe.

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.048 align:middle line:10%
The number five, their
dark side-- and this

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:10%
goes for seven also,
fives and sevens--

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:10%
escaping through drugs,
alcohol, geography, work.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.622 align:middle line:10%
And my punchline would be--

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:50.423 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Geography?

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Travel, travel, travel.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.324 align:middle line:90%
Gone, gone, gone.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.125 align:middle line:90%
Never here.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.727 align:middle line:84%
My joke would be, they
should wear a shirt

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:56.729 align:middle line:90%
that says, anywhere but here.

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:59.031 align:middle line:10%
You know, and Angelina
Jolie comes to my mind

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.499 align:middle line:10%
as a great example of a five.

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:10%
Where is she really?

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.102 align:middle line:10%
Where the heck is Angelina now?

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:03.936 align:middle line:10%
She's in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.104 align:middle line:10%
She's over there.

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.172 align:middle line:10%
She's having another baby.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.706 align:middle line:10%
She's adopting one over there.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.009 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that is
anywhere but here.

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:10.776 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.079 align:middle line:84%
But it means, never
a dull moment.

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.915 align:middle line:84%
But the downside is
slow down, take a look.

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:10%
Am I over drinking?

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.685 align:middle line:10%
Oh, and I did this in my
workshop, which was lovely,

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:20.986 align:middle line:10%
because I had all
the ones, fives,

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.254 align:middle line:10%
and sevens raise their hand.

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:25.124 align:middle line:10%
These are the cerebral number,
and I said, note that when

00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:27.726 align:middle line:10%
you drink, you never get drunk.

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:28.994 align:middle line:10%
They drink, drink,
drink, but they're

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.931 align:middle line:10%
still alive and sober because
their mind is so strong.

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:34.867 align:middle line:10%
I said, that's why you've
got to find a healthy escape.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:35.768 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, interesting.

00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:37.369 align:middle line:90%
So that addiction really never--

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.204 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they thought
it was going to do--

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:41.307 align:middle line:90%
I've earned a drink.

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:42.441 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.476 align:middle line:90%
It won't work.

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:45.044 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to find
something healthier.

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:46.512 align:middle line:90%
Yoga, meditation, something.

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:48.414 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: This is the benefit
of knowing the strengths--

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.248 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes,
knowing your numbers.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.016 align:middle line:84%
Learning a little bit--
oh, that's my downside.

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:51.951 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to work on it.

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:53.652 align:middle line:90%
Number six real quick.

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:84%
Sixes, the downside
this sabotage streak.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:59.725 align:middle line:10%
You know, they're so good at
damage control, if it's quiet,

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.193 align:middle line:10%
they know what to
do with themselves.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.229 align:middle line:10%
And they can actually
make trouble sometimes

00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:10%
when there's no trouble.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.832 align:middle line:10%
So they have to learn
to say, it's going good,

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:07.967 align:middle line:10%
and I deserve it.

00:21:07.967 --> 00:21:09.235 align:middle line:10%
That's their lesson.

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.403 align:middle line:10%
The number seven, seven
is about seeking faith.

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.404 align:middle line:10%
I said that.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.572 align:middle line:10%
But they can be cynical.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:16.175 align:middle line:10%
If they don't have faith
or haven't found a truth,

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:18.144 align:middle line:10%
they can be very
critical of other people.

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:10%
Like, it's just easy
because they're kind

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.581 align:middle line:10%
of-- puts them in a bad mood.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.415 align:middle line:10%
I want to say that.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.684 align:middle line:10%
Because they're a very
strong, smart number.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.987 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you were a
little seven life path,

00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:30.422 align:middle line:10%
and you were-- religion was
shoved down your throat.

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Good chance that
later you're like,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.458 align:middle line:10%
I don't have faith at all.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:33.459 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe in any of it.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.927 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like,
please, find your way

00:21:34.927 --> 00:21:37.363 align:middle line:10%
back, because it's your lesson.

00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:10%
The number eight.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.432 align:middle line:10%
Eight is here for the
financial security,

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:10%
but also business minded.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.936 align:middle line:10%
And they're also politics.

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.604 align:middle line:10%
They feel very
strong about what's

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:47.439 align:middle line:10%
happening, like, politically.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:51.177 align:middle line:10%
So the downside of eight is,
again, too honest in your face,

00:21:51.177 --> 00:21:52.144 align:middle line:10%
feeling so strongly.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.612 align:middle line:10%
It's my way or the highway.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:10%
So they have to learn to go, OK.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.414 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.715 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to edit.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.084 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to choose my words
carefully so I can be happier.

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.819 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Maybe slightly
resistant to change?

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:84%
Big time.
And you know what else?

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.223 align:middle line:84%
When things happen,
they also can

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:05.724 align:middle line:84%
feel like a victim
of circumstance,

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
so they have to always
say the big question.

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:09.795 align:middle line:10%
What part did I play in this?

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:10%
What-- because the minute
they say that, they

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.932 align:middle line:10%
get their power back.

00:22:12.932 --> 00:22:14.867 align:middle line:10%
If they feel like--
like they can't say,

00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:16.402 align:middle line:10%
what else could go wrong?

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:17.236 align:middle line:10%
Eights can't say that.

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Nope.
-No.

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.638 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe is
like, well, let me show you.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:20.906 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-So they can't say that.

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.607 align:middle line:90%
I've learned that.

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:22.942 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that fun?
And then the number nine--

00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:23.642 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:24.643 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:27.279 align:middle line:10%
--nine is about
family, and nines

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.614 align:middle line:10%
need to let go of the past.

00:22:28.614 --> 00:22:30.749 align:middle line:10%
It's very common for a
nine to still mourn what

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:10%
happened in their childhood.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.652 align:middle line:10%
Mom wasn't there for me,
dad wasn't there for me.

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.387 align:middle line:10%
They broke up or whatever it is.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:38.424 align:middle line:10%
They have to let go of the
past to be in the moment.

00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:10%
And they need to
learn to ask for help.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.695 align:middle line:10%
Nines are a very capable energy.

00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.096 align:middle line:10%
They don't like asking for help.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:46.098 align:middle line:10%
It's their lesson to ask.

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:47.967 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It does actually
help also if you're a parent

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:51.003 align:middle line:84%
and you know your child's
life path number, because you

00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:51.837 align:middle line:90%
will parent differently.

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:52.805 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Absolutely.
-Yeah.

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:53.706 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Well,
that's the whole point

00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:55.474 align:middle line:84%
is that when you give
birth, they may not help

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:56.976 align:middle line:90%
you pick names by the numbers.

00:22:56.976 --> 00:22:59.511 align:middle line:84%
When you understand
vibration, it's

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:02.648 align:middle line:84%
like having the edge of-- it's
like, I can figure this out.

00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:04.083 align:middle line:10%
I can help this person.

00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:05.884 align:middle line:10%
Instead of being mad that
they're different than you,

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:06.986 align:middle line:10%
they are.

00:23:06.986 --> 00:23:08.354 align:middle line:10%
Learn why they're different.

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:09.488 align:middle line:10%
And then deal with it.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.189 align:middle line:90%
Deal with

00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:11.857 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And how
you can be compatible.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.325 align:middle line:84%
So let's take some
people that we know.

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:15.594 align:middle line:10%
For example, President Obama.

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:16.295 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:17.896 align:middle line:10%
Now I want to talk
about that election,

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.732 align:middle line:10%
because that was a doozy.
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:22.134 align:middle line:10%
And I called that election,
and you can go to my website,

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.202 align:middle line:10%
and I will prove it.

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:90%
Because I called it October 21.

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.439 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a three day, might I add.

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.509 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's how that goes.

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:33.746 align:middle line:10%
This was a very tricky
election, and anyone

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.547 align:middle line:10%
who was cocky and saying
who was going to win, that's

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.949 align:middle line:10%
just simply not honest.

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:38.217 align:middle line:10%
It is so not honest.

00:23:38.217 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:10%
It was neck in neck,
up to the last second.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.423 align:middle line:10%
Let me just tell you in a
simple way-- first of all,

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.124 align:middle line:10%
I was wondering, OK.

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:47.226 align:middle line:10%
Who would Romney pick
as his running mate?

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.995 align:middle line:10%
What was funny about that, Ryan,
Paul Ryan, had the double two

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:52.965 align:middle line:10%
energy in his birth,
as does Joe Biden.

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:53.666 align:middle line:10%
So I thought, OK.

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:55.734 align:middle line:10%
That's a good partner,
because two is actually

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.603 align:middle line:10%
supportive of who they respect.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:00.205 align:middle line:10%
So that worked-- that made him
a wash, is what I want to say.

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.373 align:middle line:10%
The running mate didn't help.

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.574 align:middle line:10%
Didn't matter.
OK?

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't it.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:06.245 align:middle line:10%
It was all about
Romney and Obama.

00:24:06.245 --> 00:24:10.015 align:middle line:10%
Well, in October, Romney by
numbers-- I could see the cycle

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:11.483 align:middle line:10%
that he was in-- was
a really good cycle

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:13.285 align:middle line:10%
for him for communication.

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.354 align:middle line:10%
And remember, he nailed it.

00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:17.823 align:middle line:10%
That first debate, Romney
got the whole world talking.

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.325 align:middle line:10%
He was on fire.

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:21.994 align:middle line:10%
And Obama seemed asleep.
[LAUGH]

00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:22.795 align:middle line:90%
Which was shocking.

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:25.964 align:middle line:84%
However, in numerology, I
have created a calendar.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.901 align:middle line:10%
It was a sunny day
symbol for Romney,

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:31.737 align:middle line:10%
and it was a sun with
a cloud day for Obama.

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:34.106 align:middle line:10%
So just that simple, I
knew there'd be a problem.

00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:37.643 align:middle line:10%
And it was like saying the stars
aligned that day for Romney.

00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:39.945 align:middle line:10%
Now cut to November.

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:43.048 align:middle line:10%
I knew that Obama was going into
a personal month of one, which

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.783 align:middle line:10%
is doing whatever
you can to win.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.151 align:middle line:10%
And the actual day
of the election

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:50.689 align:middle line:10%
was a sunny day for Obama, and
not a sunny day for Romney.

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:52.725 align:middle line:10%
So just that simple stuff.
I'm like, OK.

00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:53.425 align:middle line:10%
He's got the edge.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.493 align:middle line:10%
The edge.

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.428 align:middle line:10%
I said, but with
the drama happening,

00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:59.264 align:middle line:10%
I felt there'd still be
accusations of voter fraud,

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:00.532 align:middle line:10%
which you've heard plenty.

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:02.134 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my goodness
in Pennsylvania

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:03.669 align:middle line:84%
they said it was
like 59 counties

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:05.971 align:middle line:90%
that not one vote for Romney.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:84%
Which, I'm sorry,
I don't buy that.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:09.408 align:middle line:90%
I do not, because I know humans.

00:25:09.408 --> 00:25:10.509 align:middle line:90%
We have rebels.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.678 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your family-- you
say, you need to vote for blank.

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.446 align:middle line:84%
You'd be mad and say, I'm
going to vote for the other

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.014 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like you
telling me what to do.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:18.117 align:middle line:84%
Do not tell me 100% of
anything votes for anybody.

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:19.585 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Never.
It's never happened.

00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:21.653 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.
So that's-- we did see that.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.989 align:middle line:10%
But bottom line is, he did
get it by that slide edge,

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:26.191 align:middle line:10%
and I saw it in the numbers.

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.025 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Fascinating.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:27.726 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:31.296 align:middle line:10%
So we have this December
of 2012 that we're

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:34.633 align:middle line:10%
looking at as being the
end of the year, this end

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:36.602 align:middle line:10%
of the Mayan calendar cycle.

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:39.705 align:middle line:10%
There's is a lot of attention
at this particular time

00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:40.472 align:middle line:10%
in history.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Well, yes.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.509 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
December 21, 2012?

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:44.643 align:middle line:90%
The big thing?

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:47.146 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a great
day in numerology.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.683 align:middle line:10%
When I talked to you about
picking December 3, 2012,

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:53.485 align:middle line:10%
technically that
energy's the same.

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:10%
Because look.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:10%
12-- here's why.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.157 align:middle line:10%
And people have got to just--
one thing about numerology,

00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:59.992 align:middle line:10%
you guys have
trust it is simpler

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:02.728 align:middle line:10%
than you think it is, just
when I say these simple things.

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:03.529 align:middle line:10%
Ready?

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:10%
12/3/2012.

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:10.068 align:middle line:10%
So now let's go 12/12/2012.

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.937 align:middle line:10%
Well, if the third and the 12th.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.105 align:middle line:10%
1 plus 2 is 3.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:15.641 align:middle line:10%
Exactly the same number
for the day, right?

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:16.341 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.845 align:middle line:84%
12/3 and 12/12,
because 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:22.481 align:middle line:90%
Then the 21st, 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:25.884 align:middle line:90%
So all of those are the same.

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:29.922 align:middle line:10%
So the 12/21/2012
is what number?

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:31.623 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Well, you're
going to go like this.

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:33.358 align:middle line:10%
You take the month and
day first to determine--

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:37.362 align:middle line:10%
1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 2 is 6.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.964 align:middle line:10%
That's the attitude of the day.

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.033 align:middle line:10%
Then the actual day is the 21st.

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:43.202 align:middle line:10%
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:44.636 align:middle line:10%
Then you take the full date.

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:47.639 align:middle line:10%
12/12/2012.

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:50.242 align:middle line:10%
It becomes the master number 11.

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:51.643 align:middle line:10%
And then remember,
I say that belongs

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.645 align:middle line:10%
in the family of two energy.

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:58.317 align:middle line:10%
It's like 11 is the mastery
of-- and I call it a doorway.

00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:10%
I will stand by that,
because there's two lines.

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.155 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, what
doorway are you picking?

00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:10%
What opportunity do
you want to go through?

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:10.028 align:middle line:10%
Now the difference between
12/3/2012 and 12/12,

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:12.397 align:middle line:10%
which is the same
energy, is that actually

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:16.068 align:middle line:10%
is a spiritual day
because we're headed out

00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:18.337 align:middle line:10%
of this cycle of five,
which has been chaos

00:27:18.337 --> 00:27:20.038 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit crazy.

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:21.874 align:middle line:10%
We're going into a
cycle of six, which

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:24.977 align:middle line:10%
I'm very happy about because
I know the people that are

00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:26.979 align:middle line:10%
spiritual, you get a payoff.

00:27:26.979 --> 00:27:30.749 align:middle line:10%
And that day, 12/21/2012, you
should light a white candle,

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:31.583 align:middle line:10%
write down your goals.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.151 align:middle line:10%
What am I trying to achieve?

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.152 align:middle line:10%
What are my plans?

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:35.387 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You say
there's a doorway.

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle line:84%
There's a choice.
-Yes, it is.

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:84%
So you decide, am I
going to get married?

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:39.558 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm dating.

00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.293 align:middle line:90%
Is it time to propose?

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:42.461 align:middle line:90%
I want to move.

00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:43.395 align:middle line:90%
Is it time to move?

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.297 align:middle line:84%
You're not talking about a
choice between good and evil,

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:46.198 align:middle line:84%
right?
GLYNIS MCCANTS: No.

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:49.201 align:middle line:10%
The doorway is, you decide
which way are you going.

00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.771 align:middle line:10%
And speaking of a
doorway, 9/11/2012,

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.073 align:middle line:10%
I do not want to know
what happened that day.

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:58.877 align:middle line:10%
Our ambassador was
murdered in Benghazi.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:27:59.711 align:middle line:10%
That's a big deal.

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:00.512 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's right.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.548 align:middle line:10%
Well, we can see-- and see
how your brain went, wow.

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:03.649 align:middle line:10%
I kind of forgot that.

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:05.317 align:middle line:10%
Because that's the year this is.
It's like--

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:07.753 align:middle line:84%
[SNAPPING]
--we just are moving so fast.

00:28:07.753 --> 00:28:11.356 align:middle line:84%
If you want me who's a nutbag
who's writing it all down--

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.357 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
--if you're not doing this,
you're going to forget.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.495 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:10%
When we come back
with Glynis McCants,

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:21.199 align:middle line:10%
we're going to look
forward into the year 2013,

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.669 align:middle line:10%
and look to see what we
have to look forward to.

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:25.571 align:middle line:10%
We'll be right back.
This is Lisa Garr.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:34.947 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:46.692 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:48.226 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:48.927 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.829 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is
numerologist-- also

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.865 align:middle line:84%
The Numbers Lady, as she's very
well known-- Glynis McCants.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.434 align:middle line:84%
And we're working here.
We're figuring out numbers.

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:56.702 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: That's right.
We're running numbers.

00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.337 align:middle line:84%
We're in a numbers
session here.

00:28:58.337 --> 00:28:59.972 align:middle line:10%
So what I want to
figure out is you'd

00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:02.174 align:middle line:10%
mentioned right before
the break about this 9/11.

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:02.975 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Correct.

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:05.811 align:middle line:84%
What was the
energy of 9/11/2001?

00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:10.148 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Well, let me
say quickly that 9/11/2012, when

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.619 align:middle line:10%
you take that energy, whenever
you see a master number,

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:15.053 align:middle line:10%
if you really do your
research, there's

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:18.223 align:middle line:10%
a lot of terrorist attacks that
happen on a master number 11.

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:20.258 align:middle line:10%
They seem to
embrace that energy.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:23.061 align:middle line:10%
And I can only figure,
when I talk about doorway

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.863 align:middle line:10%
of opportunity, they
decide that that

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.632 align:middle line:10%
is a significant day to attack.

00:29:26.632 --> 00:29:29.501 align:middle line:10%
Well, certainly it becomes
unforgettable when they do it.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:32.671 align:middle line:10%
So going back-- because
I believe, by the way,

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:10%
in the year 2013,
we're going to get

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.742 align:middle line:10%
a lot more detail and
information about what

00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:38.043 align:middle line:10%
happened in Benghazi.

00:29:38.043 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:10%
That story is not going away.

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.746 align:middle line:10%
That's a big story.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:45.283 align:middle line:10%
But in 9/11/2001, that
actual date was an 11.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.519 align:middle line:10%
Which is, again, 1 plus
1 is two, let's say.

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.321 align:middle line:10%
Take the full date,
reduce it to one digit.

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.389 align:middle line:10%
It's a five.

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:52.324 align:middle line:10%
The two five are so
toxic to each other,

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:53.859 align:middle line:10%
I cannot even
explain that better

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.028 align:middle line:10%
than what happened that day.

00:29:56.028 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it
seemed surreal.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.999 align:middle line:10%
Remember I said the energy five,
it looks like it's a movie.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:04.102 align:middle line:10%
Remember when you first saw the
pictures, it didn't look real?

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.704 align:middle line:10%
Like we, because
we're in California,

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:07.639 align:middle line:10%
we saw the pictures
like, is this a movie?

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.675 align:middle line:10%
And then when you saw the poor
people running down the street

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:11.877 align:middle line:10%
with smoke all over,
it's like, that looked

00:30:11.877 --> 00:30:14.413 align:middle line:10%
like a Steven Spielberg film.

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:15.614 align:middle line:10%
But it was all happening.

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:16.982 align:middle line:10%
And that's the 11.

00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:21.386 align:middle line:10%
So my message about that too,
we are foolish to not protect

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.587 align:middle line:10%
ourselves every 9/11.

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:25.524 align:middle line:10%
Because clearly, they are making
a statement with that date.

00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:26.825 align:middle line:10%
And guess what else?

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:30.996 align:middle line:84%
They waited exactly 11 years
before they attacked us again.

00:30:30.996 --> 00:30:32.164 align:middle line:84%
See?
-Yes.

00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:34.666 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
From 2001 to 2012.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.437 align:middle line:10%
So when-- and we also, when
we know our toxic number days--

00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:39.838 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.540 align:middle line:10%
How do you-- if you
have appointments,

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.507 align:middle line:10%
if you have commitments--

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.241 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Right.

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.376 align:middle line:10%
So here's how it works.

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.244 align:middle line:10%
I-- first of all, I
call it a caution day

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:47.279 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to an actual day.

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:48.747 align:middle line:10%
Because a day is a big deal.

00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:51.249 align:middle line:10%
You can't-- I have some
people, it's like, oh.

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.951 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's a
challenge day, so I'm

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.885 align:middle line:10%
not going to get out of bed.

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, nah, nah, nah, nah.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.722 align:middle line:10%
Life is a challenge.

00:30:56.722 --> 00:30:59.124 align:middle line:10%
By the way, we are on a
planet here to learn lessons.

00:30:59.124 --> 00:31:00.325 align:middle line:10%
That's all we're doing here.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:10%
We're supposed to
find ways to have joy

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.962 align:middle line:10%
and be grateful and give back.

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:06.998 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just
an easy place to be.

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:08.734 align:middle line:10%
So what I do, when
I say to you it's

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:11.603 align:middle line:10%
a caution day, what's nice
about the information,

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.238 align:middle line:10%
I say, keep your focus.

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:14.506 align:middle line:10%
Keep your eye on the prize.

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:15.774 align:middle line:10%
What is it you're here to do?

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:17.709 align:middle line:10%
And that means if someone wants
to be confrontive or rude,

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.111 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to join in.

00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:20.579 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
be a part of it.

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:21.279 align:middle line:10%
That's the message.

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.415 align:middle line:10%
It's like, take
care of yourself.

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:25.383 align:middle line:10%
It also means that things
are technically messed up.

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.184 align:middle line:10%
So what?

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:26.885 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Smile and go, it's
a challenge day.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.688 align:middle line:10%
We're OK.

00:31:29.688 --> 00:31:31.523 align:middle line:10%
It's really nice.

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:33.492 align:middle line:10%
This goes back to
knowledge is power.

00:31:33.492 --> 00:31:34.926 align:middle line:10%
That kind of
knowledge helps you.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.229 align:middle line:10%
And then if it's a sunny
day, like Mitt Romney

00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:40.031 align:middle line:10%
on the first debate, or
Obama winning the presidency,

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:10%
don't you want to know
when that date is?

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:41.767 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:42.534 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah, right.

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:43.335 align:middle line:90%
You want to plan ahead.

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:44.136 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you excited?

00:31:44.136 --> 00:31:44.903 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself a break.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.905 align:middle line:84%
No, I do-- I do understand
what you're saying.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.707 align:middle line:84%
Those days that
are challenges, you

00:31:48.707 --> 00:31:50.375 align:middle line:84%
keep your family
close to you, you

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.443 align:middle line:90%
keep your personal items close.

00:31:51.443 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Oh, yeah.
Well, let me tell you this.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:54.112 align:middle line:10%
This is another symbol I have.

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:57.382 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- the sunny symbol's,
of course, full speed ahead.

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.817 align:middle line:10%
There's a sun with
a cloud symbol.

00:31:58.817 --> 00:32:00.252 align:middle line:10%
What that is-- it's
still good for you.

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:02.788 align:middle line:10%
You take care of you, but you
don't count on someone else.

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:04.923 align:middle line:10%
So example, if you were
going to get surgery,

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.525 align:middle line:10%
you don't get surgery on
a sun with a cloud day,

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:10%
because you're
counting on the doctor.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.294 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now you have a whole
calendar that you put out,

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:09.494 align:middle line:84%
right?
-Yeah.

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.029 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
numerology calendar.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:84%
Obviously 2013 calendars
are now available.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:17.135 align:middle line:84%
It's at the website,
numberslady.com.

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:20.238 align:middle line:10%
And what it is-- these have
been out now five years.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:23.074 align:middle line:10%
And it was actually, again, Mr.
George Noory who inspired me.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:10%
Because people kept saying,
I want to get surgery.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.944 align:middle line:10%
Should I do it that day?

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.945 align:middle line:10%
And it was a bad day.

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:28.246 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, if
I could just help

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:31.883 align:middle line:10%
people get good surgery dates,
that was the first inspiration.

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.351 align:middle line:10%
Well, since then,
oh, my goodness.

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:10%
I get letters every week
of people saying, Glynis,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.955 align:middle line:10%
I got a sunny day symbol.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.123 align:middle line:10%
It was knee surgery.

00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:39.457 align:middle line:10%
He said it would take
six weeks recover.

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.659 align:middle line:10%
It took two.

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:41.459 align:middle line:10%
I hear this constantly.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.227 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:43.895 align:middle line:10%
That it just went smoothly.
That's what it's about.

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.363 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Really?
-Yeah, it's all vibration.

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.032 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Miraculously smooth.

00:32:47.032 --> 00:32:48.667 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Surprisingly.

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:49.367 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.803 align:middle line:10%
Because I have been in a
situation where I cannot

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.806 align:middle line:10%
understand why the brick seem
to be falling on my head,

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.676 align:middle line:10%
one after the next And I
think, what's wrong with me?

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:58.777 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS:
And it's not you.

00:32:58.777 --> 00:32:59.477 align:middle line:90%
It's not you.

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:01.313 align:middle line:84%
And then if you make
a note-- like, look.

00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:03.315 align:middle line:84%
I don't constantly
look at my calendar.

00:33:03.315 --> 00:33:04.616 align:middle line:84%
Like, I have people
who are obsessed.

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:05.417 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, don't do that.

00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:07.619 align:middle line:10%
Don't live like-- I'm saying,
if you have opportunity,

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:09.654 align:middle line:10%
if a new month comes
in and people are like,

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:10.856 align:middle line:10%
Lisa, when do you
want to meet us?

00:33:10.856 --> 00:33:12.824 align:middle line:10%
You're going to run over
and look for the sunny day,

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.526 align:middle line:10%
because it's your
day to meet them.

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:18.396 align:middle line:10%
But in life, if things get
weird for me, I do go, whoa.

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:10%
What's today's date?

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:22.434 align:middle line:10%
And then I smile and go, oh,
you've got to be kidding me.

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:24.436 align:middle line:10%
So my message today--
everyone, by the way,

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:27.305 align:middle line:10%
regarding 2012,
we're in December.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:29.674 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow's December 21.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Guys, this month is
hanging on for drama.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.413 align:middle line:84%
It wants to make a little more
trouble before it says goodbye.

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.782 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to pay
attention to all your details.

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Keep your focus.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.386 align:middle line:10%
And again, if it's your
relationship, if it's your job,

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.256 align:middle line:10%
if anyone wants to fight
with you, remember the words,

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:47.192 align:middle line:10%
it takes two to tango,
and don't join in.

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:48.927 align:middle line:10%
Just get through this cycle.

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:49.861 align:middle line:10%
Take care of yourself.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.863 align:middle line:10%
I know it's a time of
giving to everyone else.

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.164 align:middle line:10%
Give to you.

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:55.267 align:middle line:10%
Do something for
you in this cycle.

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:56.635 align:middle line:10%
And just take your deep breath.

00:33:56.635 --> 00:33:57.335 align:middle line:10%
It's about breathing.

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: It's only
a few more days.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.271 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.907 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, meditation, anything
to just calm it down.

00:34:01.907 --> 00:34:04.676 align:middle line:90%
What about the first of 2013?

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:06.845 align:middle line:90%
January-- 1/1/2013?

00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:08.013 align:middle line:90%
What type of day is that?

00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:09.147 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS:
Well, as you know,

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:12.117 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be sunny for
some and caution for the other.

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:13.118 align:middle line:10%
But here's the good news.

00:34:13.118 --> 00:34:15.286 align:middle line:10%
It's so much bigger than that.

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:17.956 align:middle line:10%
We're about to shift
into what I love.

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:19.024 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I love this cycle.

00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:20.391 align:middle line:10%
Because I would tell you this.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.494 align:middle line:10%
The numbers one,
two, three are magic.

00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:25.163 align:middle line:10%
Because one pushes ambition,
three's communication,

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:26.063 align:middle line:10%
two is love.

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:29.067 align:middle line:10%
Well, 2013, two, one,
three is all in there.

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.034 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Nice.
-Yeah.

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.369 align:middle line:84%
So you look at the
individual numbers--

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.205 align:middle line:84%
I look at those
first and go, OK.

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.141 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
when you look at 2012,

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:38.275 align:middle line:84%
it was double two, which
was over emotional,

00:34:38.275 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and one which was competitive.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.646 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot of fighting.
I'm right.

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.447 align:middle line:10%
No, I'm right.

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.315 align:middle line:10%
You know, what I believe.

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:44.215 align:middle line:10%
It's like, oh my gosh.

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:46.184 align:middle line:10%
How did we get so
separate from each other?

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.953 align:middle line:10%
We're in this together.

00:34:47.953 --> 00:34:49.955 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I mean, I just
wanted to take a second to say,

00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:52.157 align:middle line:84%
do you recognize that when
hearing something like this,

00:34:52.157 --> 00:34:53.291 align:middle line:90%
you look back at 2012.

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:55.793 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a rough
year, you just kind

00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:57.094 align:middle line:90%
of want to just take a breath.

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:58.697 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah, and
say, OK, it wasn't me.

00:34:58.697 --> 00:35:00.298 align:middle line:84%
That's over.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.767 align:middle line:90%
It's passing, and now I get it.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.869 align:middle line:84%
Now there's another
thing about that.

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:08.139 align:middle line:10%
A lot of relationships ended
when I think it was a mistake.

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:12.277 align:middle line:10%
Like, I think you guys, in
this new cycle of 2012-- 2013,

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:10%
when you break down 2
plus 0 plus 1 plus 3 is 6.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.217 align:middle line:10%
Six represents family and
commitment and coming together.

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.653 align:middle line:10%
So some people may have regret
that break up this year.

00:35:21.653 --> 00:35:24.155 align:middle line:10%
I will not be surprised
if you see that shift.

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:27.425 align:middle line:10%
And I see the new year as a
time for real family stuff.

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:29.861 align:middle line:10%
Getting married,
signing contracts.

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:32.330 align:middle line:10%
It's like, big-- it's a shift.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.965 align:middle line:10%
And if you did
struggle this year,

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.166 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
feel the difference.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.935 align:middle line:10%
Like, if I-- I would say,
if you lived this year

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:10%
and it was black
and white for you,

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.005 align:middle line:10%
you wake up in living color.

00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:41.706 align:middle line:10%
It is a nice change.

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:44.075 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been struggling
and things have not been

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.377 align:middle line:90%
falling into place, will they?

00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:46.244 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel calmer.

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.213 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel like you
have more control again.

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:50.949 align:middle line:84%
That out of control feeling
will not be a part of next year.

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:53.752 align:middle line:10%
Now what will happen, though,
it's a magnetic energy,

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:55.253 align:middle line:10%
so be careful not to sabotage.

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.388 align:middle line:10%
Remember what I said.

00:35:56.388 --> 00:35:59.391 align:middle line:10%
When it's going smoothly,
don't mess it up.

00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:01.326 align:middle line:10%
Just say, it's going
good, and I deserve it.

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:03.561 align:middle line:10%
Just like a life
path six, all of us

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:06.464 align:middle line:10%
should be saying that as we
have success in the new cycle.

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:07.599 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What
about financially

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:09.868 align:middle line:90%
for our country in 2013?

00:36:09.868 --> 00:36:11.503 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: It's
about growing up.

00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:12.771 align:middle line:10%
It's about, I'm sorry.

00:36:12.771 --> 00:36:14.039 align:middle line:10%
There's this thing
called budget.

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:16.107 align:middle line:10%
It's about establishing one.

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:90%
This is such a bizarre time.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
The lack of accountability for
our leaders-- we pick them,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.315 align:middle line:84%
we elect them.
It's our job.

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:26.317 align:middle line:84%
It's scary to see
the pointing-- I

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.352 align:middle line:90%
called it the Pointer Sisters.

00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:84%
If I point to you,
you point to me.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.889 align:middle line:84%
But I see that shifting
for the better too.

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.323 align:middle line:84%
Like, we just have
to figure it out.

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:33.925 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, I'm in
that place in my own life.

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.493 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
places in my life

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:37.796 align:middle line:84%
where I've been overwhelmed
and not wanting to look at it.

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:40.865 align:middle line:10%
It has been all about
looking and being accountable

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:44.402 align:middle line:10%
for all-- putting systems
and structures in place where

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to look before.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.439 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: And
here's the other thing--

00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:49.074 align:middle line:10%
and I want people to
forgive themselves

00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:10%
for this-- that the natural
state of life is chaos.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.412 align:middle line:10%
So when your room
looks like a tsunami,

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.081 align:middle line:10%
that's actually normal.

00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:10%
But in life, we need
structure and organization.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.752 align:middle line:10%
So if you can get
it back on track,

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:02.287 align:middle line:10%
then your life is
so much better.

00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:04.289 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yes.
-It just takes an effort.

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:06.291 align:middle line:10%
But I want people to forgive
themselves to go, oh, my gosh.

00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:07.826 align:middle line:10%
Look at my place.
It's like, no.

00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:08.526 align:middle line:10%
That's natural.

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.328 align:middle line:10%
But you've got to-- you've
got to fix it and find

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:10%
the paperwork and make sure
everything is where it should

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.331 align:middle line:10%
be so it's not so chaotic.

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:14.032 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:37:14.032 --> 00:37:16.234 align:middle line:84%
So what are the natural
sunny days 2013?

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.635 align:middle line:90%
What are some of them?

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:20.305 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I could
talk to you about that.

00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:22.107 align:middle line:10%
Because like I said,
each one of is different.

00:37:22.107 --> 00:37:23.808 align:middle line:10%
These are life path numbers.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:10%
There is a thing called
personal year cycle, though.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.879 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to tap a little
in that, because we didn't.

00:37:27.879 --> 00:37:28.947 align:middle line:10%
Let's just at least do you.

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:30.248 align:middle line:10%
What's your month and day?

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.683 align:middle line:90%
12/29.

00:37:31.683 --> 00:37:32.417 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:33.351 align:middle line:90%
So 12/29.

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.319 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need.

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:35.653 align:middle line:84%
And then you add it
to the world number.

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:39.424 align:middle line:90%
So 1 plus 2 plus 2 plus 9.

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:40.692 align:middle line:10%
5, 9, 14.
LISA GARR: 14.

00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:43.061 align:middle line:10%
Right.
And then 1 plus 4 is 5.

00:37:43.061 --> 00:37:44.596 align:middle line:10%
Now you have a five
added to-- which,

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:46.231 align:middle line:10%
by the way, does
mean, no matter how

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:47.966 align:middle line:10%
smooth you'd like it to be--
-Drama.

00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:48.867 align:middle line:90%
--it comes after you.

00:37:48.867 --> 00:37:50.835 align:middle line:90%
It comes after you.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:84%
But you take it to
the world number.

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:55.406 align:middle line:10%
Now this year was
actually a shift

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.442 align:middle line:10%
for you getting into the
driver's seat of your life.

00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:58.676 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there has been success.

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.578 align:middle line:10%
There has been
some great breaks.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:02.347 align:middle line:10%
That happened this year, see?

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:03.681 align:middle line:10%
So that part's good.

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:07.018 align:middle line:10%
Because 5 plus 5, which
was 2012, equals 10.

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.853 align:middle line:10%
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:11.022 align:middle line:10%
But the new cycle,
you go into cycle

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.291 align:middle line:10%
two, which is your intuition--

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:13.992 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Wait.

00:38:13.992 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Break down the personal life.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.561 align:middle line:90%
Which number are you talking--

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:18.363 align:middle line:90%
You take your month and day.

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:20.165 align:middle line:84%
We already did it simple.
-OK.

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.599 align:middle line:84%
-You were born 12/29.
-OK.

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.934 align:middle line:90%
Break it down to one digit.

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:25.537 align:middle line:84%
We established it was a five.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:38:25.537 --> 00:38:29.908 align:middle line:90%
So now 2012 is also a five.

00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:31.843 align:middle line:84%
So 5 plus 5 is 10.
-All right.

00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:32.844 align:middle line:84%
That was a disaster.
OK.

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:34.112 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:38.116 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but you personally
had big breaks.

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:39.484 align:middle line:10%
The personal year of one.

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:41.219 align:middle line:10%
So do you see what I'm saying?

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:41.953 align:middle line:10%
OK, what I want to--

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:43.721 align:middle line:10%
So let's do 2013, when
you're adding the one.

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.356 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: It's a layer.

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.692 align:middle line:84%
The cycle of five was above
our head, messing with us.

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:48.726 align:middle line:90%
The world number five.

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.162 align:middle line:84%
But you as a person, there were
some good things happening--

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:51.896 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:54.265 align:middle line:84%
--because you were in
a personal year of one.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.334 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, how do I get
more in charge of my life?

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.303 align:middle line:10%
How do I get more
of a payoff, like,

00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:00.238 align:middle line:10%
even in career and success?

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:03.074 align:middle line:10%
But the new cycle, it
just shifts by one point

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.576 align:middle line:10%
because it's a six.

00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:06.444 align:middle line:10%
If we're five, it's a six.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.314 align:middle line:10%
So now add the six to your five.

00:39:09.314 --> 00:39:10.582 align:middle line:10%
You have a five attitude.

00:39:10.582 --> 00:39:12.417 align:middle line:10%
6 plus 5 is--
LISA GARR: 11.

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:14.118 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: 1 plus 1 is--
-2.

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:18.056 align:middle line:10%
And two means your intuition
will be stronger than ever.

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:22.293 align:middle line:10%
Your gut instinct-- You know,
I say-- I teach people to know

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.796 align:middle line:10%
that no is a complete sentence.

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:10%
And that's hard for you.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.732 align:middle line:10%
When you say no, you feel
like you have to explain it.

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:28.833 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That
is a great phrase.

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:29.534 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:31.603 align:middle line:84%
So you and the
cycle need to know,

00:39:31.603 --> 00:39:33.204 align:middle line:90%
no is a complete sentence.

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:35.974 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing
it, and you move on.

00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:36.841 align:middle line:90%
But it's intuition.

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:39.811 align:middle line:10%
It means you're gut-levelly
going to get the answers much

00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:41.713 align:middle line:10%
quicker for yourself, Lisa.

00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:44.182 align:middle line:10%
And it'll be about
love and emotion.

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:46.084 align:middle line:10%
So it goes, again,
back to family

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:48.086 align:middle line:10%
and what matters most to you.

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:50.088 align:middle line:10%
But it's also business.

00:39:50.088 --> 00:39:52.090 align:middle line:10%
The numbers two, four,
eight are business-minded,

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:54.592 align:middle line:10%
but two does business
with their heart.

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:55.893 align:middle line:84%
So that means
you'll make income,

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.196 align:middle line:90%
but because of what you love.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:01.165 align:middle line:84%
And the love that you bring is
where your income comes from.

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.401 align:middle line:10%
And my big message
about money to everybody

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:07.071 align:middle line:10%
is, God put you on a planet that
cost money, so he better have

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.239 align:middle line:10%
plans for you to make some.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.277 align:middle line:84%
It's not free to be here,
or you'd do it all for free.

00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:10%
You know, but the other thing
is when you have-- meaning you,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.682 align:middle line:10%
Lisa Garr-- you're generous.

00:40:17.682 --> 00:40:18.883 align:middle line:10%
When you're ahead,
you want to give.

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:20.218 align:middle line:10%
It's like, what
cause can I help.

00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:21.252 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Absolutely.
-See?

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.754 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Absolutely.
-Yeah.

00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:25.089 align:middle line:10%
So when we start
looking at it right

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.425 align:middle line:10%
and look at our little messages,
it makes life very exciting.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:28.926 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yes.
-Makes it easier.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.161 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: It is amazing.

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.663 align:middle line:10%
It is.
LISA GARR: So, OK.

00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:34.766 align:middle line:84%
So then 2013 is going
to be a little bit

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:36.534 align:middle line:90%
of an easier year for people.

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:37.635 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a magnetic year.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:38.369 align:middle line:90%
It's the year of six.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:42.607 align:middle line:10%
It's slower, which I think
always makes things easier.

00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:45.777 align:middle line:10%
If things move too
fast, we can't remember.

00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:47.645 align:middle line:10%
Our mind goes nuts.

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.347 align:middle line:10%
It goes back to
family, like I said.

00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:50.048 align:middle line:10%
It's your home.

00:40:50.048 --> 00:40:52.583 align:middle line:10%
It's about-- it's about
being in your body.

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:53.284 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:56.354 align:middle line:10%
If you feel like you neglected
yourself, it's a cycle.

00:40:56.354 --> 00:40:57.388 align:middle line:10%
Look at you again and go, no.

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.624 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to take
better care, nutrition,

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:01.926 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to exercise,
I'm going to breathe.

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:02.593 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.062 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to
write it down and know

00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:05.029 align:middle line:10%
that it's going to get done.

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.431 align:middle line:10%
And when these
opportunities come to me,

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:08.833 align:middle line:10%
I won't be out of my head.

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.501 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What about
relationships with the times

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:11.302 align:middle line:84%
to--
-It's big.

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.503 align:middle line:90%
It's the time for commitment.

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:13.538 align:middle line:90%
You could easily get married.

00:41:13.538 --> 00:41:16.507 align:middle line:84%
And I love the cycle
of six for marriage.

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.576 align:middle line:10%
I think we're going to see
a lot of good commitment

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:19.744 align:middle line:10%
stuff happening.
I do.

00:41:19.744 --> 00:41:20.511 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Good.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.113 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I said,
the only caution-- like,

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:24.482 align:middle line:10%
you talk about the
shadow side-- don't

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:26.851 align:middle line:10%
sabotage when it's going well.

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:28.619 align:middle line:84%
Say, ooh, it's going
good, and I deserve it.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.655 align:middle line:84%
And if you're already married,
is it a good time to recommit?

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.491 align:middle line:84%
That's a good time to look at
that relationship, rekindle.

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Have we become roommates
because we're so tired?

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.362 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to romance.

00:41:37.362 --> 00:41:39.364 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back to the
weekly date night.

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:42.266 align:middle line:10%
Maybe get a babysitter said
stay the night at a hotel.

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:46.037 align:middle line:10%
You know, that's what it means,
getting back to the basics.

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:48.106 align:middle line:10%
Getting back to
what matters most,

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:49.974 align:middle line:10%
and being in the moment
with what's around you.

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.509 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And I mean,
that's a great excuse

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.611 align:middle line:10%
even if you believe
nothing we're saying,

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.847 align:middle line:10%
to go back to your relationship
if there is conflict,

00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:58.449 align:middle line:10%
and just restore it anyway.
[LAUGH]

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.717 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah,
well let me say-

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.285 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be easier.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.755 align:middle line:84%
And doing this now
for so many years

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:06.624 align:middle line:84%
and proving it-- like I said,
the blessing of the cycle

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.226 align:middle line:90%
of five for me was every show.

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:10.828 align:middle line:84%
I even was on the
wonderful "Dr. Oz Show."

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:12.730 align:middle line:10%
And the man is a medical doctor.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.732 align:middle line:10%
And he said, you
know, Glynis, he goes,

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:10%
I learned so much in India.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.068 align:middle line:10%
I heard about numerology.

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:18.236 align:middle line:10%
He goes, but you've
been my teacher

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:19.303 align:middle line:10%
in everything you've just said.

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:21.205 align:middle line:10%
He tested me with
the whole crowd.

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:23.441 align:middle line:10%
Every word out my mouth,
he goes, it's dead on.

00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:10%
He goes, and your
advice is sound.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.779 align:middle line:10%
Your advice is accurate.

00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:29.414 align:middle line:10%
So when you say, hey, if
you don't believe a word

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:31.883 align:middle line:10%
we're saying, I say,
shame on you if you do.

00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.684 align:middle line:10%
Shame on you for one reason.

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:34.886 align:middle line:10%
Open it up for yourself.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:37.855 align:middle line:10%
It's not about-- it's
not a competitive game.

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:39.457 align:middle line:10%
It's about, learn
it for yourself.

00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:41.159 align:middle line:10%
Take advantage of the tool.

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.361 align:middle line:10%
It exists, and it could
make your life easier.

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:44.462 align:middle line:10%
That's all I want for everybody.

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:45.963 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I'm really
glad that you said that,

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.632 align:middle line:90%
because I'm obviously a fan.

00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for years.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.201 align:middle line:84%
A long time.
-Almost a decade.

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:51.169 align:middle line:84%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes,
that's exactly right.

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:51.869 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.971 align:middle line:84%
And so I am a fan, and I speak
to you from that perspective.

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.039 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.742 align:middle line:10%
And I invite anyone else to go
on their own quest with this.

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:58.443 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.812 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, because
some people are like, well,

00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:01.512 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeptic.

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:10%
And I say, by all
means, hit the library.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:04.715 align:middle line:10%
Just go pick up a book.

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.717 align:middle line:10%
It's not about, oh, you
have to buy my book.

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:09.887 align:middle line:10%
I say, first of all,
why wouldn't you?

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.289 align:middle line:10%
The price point's low.

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:13.491 align:middle line:10%
It's not like I'm saying, pay
$300 bucks for the-- you know,

00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:15.092 align:middle line:10%
it's like $15 on Amazon.

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.594 align:middle line:10%
I do it for one reason.

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:10%
I know all this
research I did, I

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.199 align:middle line:10%
laid it out and
simplified it for you

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:10%
get to apply it to your life.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.101 align:middle line:10%
Lucky you.

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:10%
When I first studied
numbers, I couldn't find

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.372 align:middle line:10%
one book that made sense to me.

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.141 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: "Love by the
Numbers" is your second book.

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:30.675 align:middle line:90%
The first book--

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the first one's
"Glynis Has Your Number,"

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.045 align:middle line:90%
which people really respond to.

00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:36.347 align:middle line:10%
I think of it more of
the buffet of numbers,

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:10%
because I cover, like, location
when you move somewhere,

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:39.684 align:middle line:10%
breaking down the energy.

00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:41.085 align:middle line:10%
When you a pet.

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Compatibility.
Everything.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.222 align:middle line:90%
I cover everything.

00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:46.591 align:middle line:10%
However, when it
comes to relationships

00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:48.259 align:middle line:10%
and understanding your
partner, you can't

00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:10%
beat "Love by the Numbers."

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.195 align:middle line:10%
And it's not just your partner.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:53.331 align:middle line:10%
In business, you can
break down numbers.

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:54.765 align:middle line:10%
These are standalone books.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:56.834 align:middle line:10%
I have people who own both
and get a lot from each

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:57.902 align:middle line:10%
for different reasons.

00:43:57.902 --> 00:43:59.971 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: We're going
to take a look at a clip

00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:03.641 align:middle line:10%
that Glynis has that is
an extraordinary example

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.177 align:middle line:10%
of her work with
numerology in play.

00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:07.044 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:09.247 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want to
say about Lady Diana.

00:44:09.247 --> 00:44:11.349 align:middle line:84%
When the whole thing
happened, I was devastated,

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:13.017 align:middle line:90%
as I know everyone was.

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.453 align:middle line:84%
And I say that
because we loved her.

00:44:15.453 --> 00:44:17.955 align:middle line:84%
And we loved her because
she gave so much.

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's what sevens do.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.493 align:middle line:84%
But when I studied
her, I thought, whoa.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Al-Fayed and her had three
numbers out a five in common.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.531 align:middle line:90%
HOST: They were soul mates.

00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:27.365 align:middle line:90%
They were soul mates.

00:44:27.365 --> 00:44:30.201 align:middle line:84%
And she did not have numbers
in common with Prince Charles.

00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So she had found someone
who truly loved her

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.872 align:middle line:90%
and treated her beautifully.

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:38.442 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's tragic that
she died, but in such

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.344 align:middle line:90%
a good moment for herself.

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.579 align:middle line:90%
She felt loved.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:45.516 align:middle line:84%
She felt appreciated and
adored for the first time.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we had to put-- you
know, have a time to die,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.054 align:middle line:90%
that's the time.

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:52.623 align:middle line:84%
When everything's terrific
and you feel good.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:53.357 align:middle line:90%
She was happy.

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.226 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:57.695 align:middle line:10%
Right now, they are pinching
themselves thinking,

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.496 align:middle line:10%
they must be dreaming.

00:44:58.496 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:10%
It is that good.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.232 align:middle line:10%
It is that powerful.

00:45:01.232 --> 00:45:03.401 align:middle line:10%
But it's not real.

00:45:03.401 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:10%
VOICEOVER: Numerologist
Glynis McCants

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:07.705 align:middle line:10%
is the author of "Glynis Has
Your Number," and founder

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.874 align:middle line:10%
of the website numberslady.com.

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:13.611 align:middle line:10%
She says that numerologically
speaking, Angelina and Billy

00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:15.913 align:middle line:10%
Bob just don't add up.

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:18.749 align:middle line:10%
I know for a fact he
will regret his decision.

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:21.552 align:middle line:10%
And I've done this 16
years, so I'm not guessing.

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.821 align:middle line:10%
I just looked at this and
went, oh, my goodness.

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.023 align:middle line:10%
VOICEOVER: Both were
born on a four day.

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:28.192 align:middle line:10%
And when each
birthday is added up,

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:31.596 align:middle line:10%
they both total to
the same number, five.

00:45:31.596 --> 00:45:34.765 align:middle line:10%
When you meet someone who's
got your numbers exactly,

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.268 align:middle line:10%
it is this out of sight feeling.

00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:38.869 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's like crazy in love.

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:39.737 align:middle line:10%
And that's what they are.

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.773 align:middle line:10%
So it's definitely
sexual and passionate,

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.375 align:middle line:10%
but that's not
necessarily grounds

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:46.844 align:middle line:10%
for a long-term relationship.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:49.013 align:middle line:10%
Fives live like they're
in a soap opera.

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:50.381 align:middle line:10%
They're in a book, you know?

00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:51.382 align:middle line:10%
It's a new chapter.

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:52.249 align:middle line:10%
New novel.

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.118 align:middle line:10%
No accident they're both actors.

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:57.221 align:middle line:10%
But when the curtain goes
down, you deal with reality.

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.724 align:middle line:10%
And they have not even
looked at the reality yet.

00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:01.425 align:middle line:10%
They're nowhere near it.

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.794 align:middle line:10%
VOICEOVER: According to Glynis,
five's the freedom, fun,

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.528 align:middle line:10%
and adventure.

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.564 align:middle line:10%
Add to this a five's
fear of commitment,

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:08.799 align:middle line:10%
and you have trouble.

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:10.868 align:middle line:10%
You know, she's been through
a couple of marriages,

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.436 align:middle line:10%
and she's in her early '20s.

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.007 align:middle line:10%
And going back to Billy Bob,
this is his fifth marriage.

00:46:16.007 --> 00:46:17.742 align:middle line:10%
Not real good at commitment.

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:20.378 align:middle line:10%
And what's funny is
the word is, they

00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:25.116 align:middle line:10%
removed the vow in the marriage
of till death do us part.

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:26.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, no kidding.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.785 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:29.020 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to happen.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.022 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC - THE JAGS, "BACK OF MY
HAND (I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER"]

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:41.465 align:middle line:84%
That clip that we just saw
was right around the time

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:44.068 align:middle line:84%
that Princess Diana died, right?
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes.

00:46:44.068 --> 00:46:46.303 align:middle line:10%
She died in 1997.

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:50.908 align:middle line:10%
And I was a reoccurring guest on
Leeza's show, which was great.

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:53.844 align:middle line:10%
But it was so devastating,
as you remember.

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.012 align:middle line:10%
We were all devastated.

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:56.380 align:middle line:10%
She had such a huge heart.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.216 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the
emotion was so palpable.

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:00.084 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:01.619 align:middle line:10%
So joining us, you
always have such

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:05.656 align:middle line:10%
a great example of
using people as examples

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.091 align:middle line:10%
for reading their numbers.

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And joining us is
Melanie Martin.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.362 align:middle line:84%
She is an employee
of Gaiam, and she's

00:47:11.362 --> 00:47:13.431 align:middle line:90%
here to be our Guinea pig.

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:14.632 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:14.632 --> 00:47:16.534 align:middle line:84%
So Glynis got your
numbers ahead of time,

00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:19.003 align:middle line:90%
which consists of what?

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:22.840 align:middle line:10%
What I have is the first and
last name you go by today.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.509 align:middle line:10%
It tells us the vibration
you put out today.

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.712 align:middle line:10%
The birth certificate name
gives you a destiny number,

00:47:27.712 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:10%
but that's not what
I'm doing right now.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.015 align:middle line:10%
I'm just looking at,
what is the energy?

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:32.683 align:middle line:10%
When you say, my
name is Melanie,

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.985 align:middle line:10%
and you give your information,
that's your vibration.

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
talk about that.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.188 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Even if she
was married and had

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:38.322 align:middle line:10%
her husband's last name--

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.857 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Then
that's what would matter.

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.826 align:middle line:10%
Whatever she puts out
today is what matters.

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:44.061 align:middle line:10%
And then your full
date of birth tells me

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.297 align:middle line:10%
the most important numbers,
which is your life path

00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:48.232 align:middle line:10%
and the day you're
born and attitude.

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.701 align:middle line:10%
So here's what I see.

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.169 align:middle line:84%
You're ultimately
a three life path.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.405 align:middle line:84%
Threes are here to motivate
and uplift other people.

00:47:54.405 --> 00:47:56.307 align:middle line:90%
So you field called to that.

00:47:56.307 --> 00:47:58.976 align:middle line:10%
You also-- threes are known
for eyes, smile, voice.

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:02.246 align:middle line:10%
So it's no accident that you're
attractive because if you

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:04.215 align:middle line:10%
weren't, you'd be depressed.
You were.

00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:05.015 align:middle line:10%
You see what I'm saying?

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:10%
It's not about others.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.753 align:middle line:10%
It's you trying to
be your best self.

00:48:08.753 --> 00:48:10.488 align:middle line:10%
Humor.
You love to laugh.

00:48:10.488 --> 00:48:11.989 align:middle line:10%
If you can hang with
someone funny-- and also

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:10%
you look for the punchline.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.791 align:middle line:10%
I do.

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:14.492 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:48:14.492 --> 00:48:16.093 align:middle line:10%
Well, I say a three's
a natural comedian.

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.628 align:middle line:10%
And you have a double three.

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:20.765 align:middle line:10%
Your soul number's fulfilled
by a two, which tells me

00:48:20.765 --> 00:48:22.166 align:middle line:10%
when you're hanging
out with your friends,

00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:25.102 align:middle line:10%
having a good time, you
love to know the gossip.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.470 align:middle line:10%
Do not tell me you don't.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.171 align:middle line:10%
I do

00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:28.105 align:middle line:10%
You like to be in the know.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.007 align:middle line:84%
And if you check your
cell phone or whatever

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:32.343 align:middle line:84%
and there's no messages,
that's very depressing to you.

00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:33.511 align:middle line:84%
It's like, where
did my friends go?

00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:35.246 align:middle line:84%
-Yes
-And why am I out of the loop?

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:37.281 align:middle line:10%
You really like
to know what's up.

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.583 align:middle line:10%
I say that the three is a light.

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.685 align:middle line:10%
But because you're a light--
and I want to even say this.

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.721 align:middle line:10%
The brighter the light,
the bigger the bugs.

00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:46.123 align:middle line:10%
Meeting emotional people,
people who drain you.

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.792 align:middle line:10%
It's like, they almost
want something from you.

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:50.494 align:middle line:10%
Be very careful who you
invite into your life.

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:53.364 align:middle line:84%
You've got to pick
and choose wisely.

00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:54.098 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:54.999 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a five, which
means, never a dull moment.

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.303 align:middle line:84%
So you have a party
that gets bored easy.

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:00.271 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, what's next?

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:01.205 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:49:01.205 --> 00:49:03.908 align:middle line:10%
And if you get to go to a
party, that's you at your best.

00:49:03.908 --> 00:49:04.775 align:middle line:10%
It's like, you can't wait.

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:05.810 align:middle line:10%
What am I going to wear?

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:06.877 align:middle line:10%
What are we going to have?

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.779 align:middle line:10%
And then good
conversation, like I said.

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.214 align:middle line:10%
Now are you dating or married?

00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:11.916 align:middle line:10%
-I am dating.
-OK.

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:14.518 align:middle line:10%
So this is the other message
of the three life path.

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:17.054 align:middle line:10%
Be careful, because you're
a natural counselor,

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:10%
not to attract the patient.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.491 align:middle line:10%
Meaning someone
who's always a mess,

00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:22.326 align:middle line:10%
and who is trying
to fix their mess

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:23.394 align:middle line:10%
and trying to give them advice.

00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:24.528 align:middle line:90%
That's not your job.

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:27.798 align:middle line:84%
What you hope for
and want is an equal.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.834 align:middle line:84%
You can have that, but
you've got to be careful not

00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:31.135 align:middle line:90%
to settle for less than that.

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:32.169 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Do we have that?

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.705 align:middle line:10%
That is-- I think
he's an equal.

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:35.406 align:middle line:10%
But, yeah.

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:36.874 align:middle line:10%
What's his date of
birth real quick?

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.643 align:middle line:10%
Just for the fast food of it.
-12/5/76.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.816 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: OK, so
you think so, but--

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:46.784 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:49.019 align:middle line:84%
Here's this golden
opportunity for Glynis to be

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:49.954 align:middle line:90%
able to do your chart there.

00:49:49.954 --> 00:49:50.955 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I would tell you.

00:49:50.955 --> 00:49:54.058 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you guys have
a soul mate connection.

00:49:54.058 --> 00:49:55.459 align:middle line:10%
It's why you think
it's a big deal.

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:57.428 align:middle line:10%
And soul mate means
one of two things.

00:49:57.428 --> 00:49:58.929 align:middle line:10%
It could be, oh, eureka.
I found it.

00:49:58.929 --> 00:49:59.697 align:middle line:10%
Lucky me.

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:01.565 align:middle line:10%
Or, I'll never do it again.

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:03.601 align:middle line:10%
So it's-- how long
have you been dating?

00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:05.636 align:middle line:10%
Oh, five years.

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:07.004 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.106 align:middle line:10%
He's got the four life
path, which is that solid,

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:10.241 align:middle line:10%
you can count on me.

00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:11.375 align:middle line:10%
But he's born on
a five day, which

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.043 align:middle line:10%
means his way or the highway.

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.379 align:middle line:10%
When he wants to do what he
wants to do, he gets busy.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:17.047 align:middle line:10%
He gets caught up
in his own schedule.

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.148 align:middle line:10%
That's him.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:20.885 align:middle line:10%
And then attitude
number-- you said 12/5?

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:21.919 align:middle line:10%
-Mm-hm.
-OK.

00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:24.588 align:middle line:10%
So what the compliment
is-- they like pretty.

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:25.923 align:middle line:10%
If you're not pretty,
he'd be depressed.

00:50:25.923 --> 00:50:28.025 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]
Oh, you know it's true.

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Bad hair day, don't
go outside with him.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.361 align:middle line:10%
-OK.
-No.

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:31.495 align:middle line:10%
He wants you to
look good, but he

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.464 align:middle line:10%
should be willing to say that.

00:50:33.464 --> 00:50:34.732 align:middle line:90%
To say, honey, you look good.

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:90%
He wants to be proud of you.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.903 align:middle line:84%
So is he working on
a plan for marriage?

00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:39.937 align:middle line:84%
What's the deal?
Because--

00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:41.739 align:middle line:10%
That's what he's
telling my parents.

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:42.439 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.909 align:middle line:10%
Because the four
likes to have a plan.

00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:10%
What did he pick for work?

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.245 align:middle line:10%
-He owns a business.
-OK.

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:51.248 align:middle line:10%
Because a four like
that, they need security.

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.716 align:middle line:10%
And until they feel
they have security,

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.318 align:middle line:10%
they don't want to get married.

00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:56.153 align:middle line:10%
They want to feel like
the time is right.

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.188 align:middle line:10%
But they are the ones, when
they make a commitment,

00:50:58.188 --> 00:50:59.423 align:middle line:10%
they stand by their commitment.

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:01.125 align:middle line:10%
So in that way, yes.

00:51:01.125 --> 00:51:02.159 align:middle line:10%
He is good.

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:04.895 align:middle line:10%
And plus, you guys have
so much yin yang energy.

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.797 align:middle line:10%
Like, you sometimes
have to cheer

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:07.865 align:middle line:10%
him up, make him feel better.

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:09.433 align:middle line:10%
Because when he's
upset, he gets very--

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:10.367 align:middle line:10%
That's so true.

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:11.936 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, well, he
goes in his shell.

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:10%
I always say, a
four has a shell.

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:14.305 align:middle line:10%
So you'll have to
bang on it going,

00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:15.539 align:middle line:10%
honey, what's up with you?

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:10%
Because he'll go quiet.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.609 align:middle line:10%
Whereas you're like, oh, you
know, you'll be a goofball,

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:19.310 align:middle line:10%
a cheerleader.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.412 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you can to
get him back to life.

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.646 align:middle line:90%
And he does appreciate that.

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:23.347 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:24.114 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:24.848 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:27.184 align:middle line:10%
The other thing is, you
share the number five,

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.552 align:middle line:10%
which means you should travel.

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:31.155 align:middle line:10%
Like, find ways to get out
of your regular environment.

00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:32.957 align:middle line:10%
Even if it's a hotel
just for romance,

00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:34.858 align:middle line:10%
for the weekend, good
idea for both of you.

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:35.559 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:37.494 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, remember to get
out of your regular space

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:38.996 align:middle line:10%
so you guys can
enjoy each other.

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:40.331 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Do you
like to travel also?

00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:41.031 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.999 align:middle line:84%
And we're both Sagittarians,
so I think that's a part of it

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:43.701 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:46.303 align:middle line:84%
We just love to get out and
travel and just go anywhere.

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.104 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:49.540 align:middle line:10%
And of course, because I'm The
Numbers Lady, I would only say,

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.341 align:middle line:10%
it's strictly numbers.

00:51:50.341 --> 00:51:52.876 align:middle line:10%
Now mind you,
astrology is accurate.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.778 align:middle line:10%
No doubt.
But it's different.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:56.380 align:middle line:10%
It's like, OK, what
city were you born?

00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.584 align:middle line:10%
The reason I don't applaud it as
much is every man I ever cared

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.753 align:middle line:10%
about, astrology said
I was no good with,

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:04.822 align:middle line:10%
and there were soul
mates in numerology.

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.491 align:middle line:10%
When I learned numerology,
I realized, wait a second.

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:08.659 align:middle line:10%
So do you see what I mean?

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.028 align:middle line:10%
That was my concern.

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:12.930 align:middle line:10%
But when I meet an
astrologer who's gifted,

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.965 align:middle line:10%
their conclusions
are the same as mine.

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.767 align:middle line:10%
They read it a different
way, but it's the same.

00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:18.569 align:middle line:10%
But note the speed
of what I just did.

00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:19.269 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:20.671 align:middle line:10%
That's why I love the numbers.

00:52:20.671 --> 00:52:21.372 align:middle line:10%
Like, I look at this.

00:52:21.372 --> 00:52:22.439 align:middle line:10%
You can run, but you can't hide.

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:23.974 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Does this
make sense to you?

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.809 align:middle line:10%
It does, although
I'm a little bit,

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:27.611 align:middle line:10%
like, scared about
the relationship bit

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:28.612 align:middle line:10%
that you just shared.

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.048 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm like,
I hope it's what I

00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:32.916 align:middle line:10%
had imagined that it would be.

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.618 align:middle line:84%
But honey, wouldn't
you rather know now?

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:35.686 align:middle line:90%
I would like to know now, yeah.

00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:37.855 align:middle line:84%
Well, but remember
also what I said.

00:52:37.855 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This is about--
you know, challenge

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.525 align:middle line:90%
numbers promote chemistry.

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:44.128 align:middle line:10%
Like, I'm in a marriage-- my
husband's a four, I'm a three.

00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:45.729 align:middle line:10%
It's a challenge.
That's life.

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.266 align:middle line:10%
Being afraid of anything is
such a waste of your time.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.902 align:middle line:10%
Don't try to make it
prettier than what it is.

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:53.737 align:middle line:10%
Because when you understand
him, you're going to get

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.739 align:middle line:10%
a better man from this man.

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.441 align:middle line:10%
You know he can be
very complicated.

00:52:57.441 --> 00:52:58.675 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: And
Glynis's relationship

00:52:58.675 --> 00:52:59.710 align:middle line:10%
is a four and a three also.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.378 align:middle line:10%
I have an amazing
husband for 10 years,

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:10%
but that's because
I understand him.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.648 align:middle line:84%
I know how to
bring out his best.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.417 align:middle line:10%
The reason you want to
understand your differences

00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:08.452 align:middle line:10%
is so you can bring out
the best in this man

00:53:08.452 --> 00:53:10.988 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of his life.
-Wow.

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:13.857 align:middle line:84%
That was an incredibly
accurate reading for Melanie.

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:16.593 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take another
look at Glynis McCants.

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:18.395 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE], I
broke down your numbers.

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.531 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, there are
three numbers in a name,

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:21.432 align:middle line:90%
there are two in a birth.

00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:23.367 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I get.
I look at you.

00:53:23.367 --> 00:53:25.369 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is,
you're a three life path.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:27.971 align:middle line:84%
So if you have something to
say, no one can stop you.

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:31.875 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:53:34.812 --> 00:53:37.281 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
you're a natural detective.

00:53:37.281 --> 00:53:37.981 align:middle line:90%
You have a five.

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.817 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's lying, you're
going to find out the truth,

00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:40.951 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to confront them.

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:41.585 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.553 align:middle line:90%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: That's right.

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.621 align:middle line:84%
And when you get mad, it's
an Oscar winning performance.

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:45.622 align:middle line:90%
You are scary.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.191 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER]
OK?

00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:48.425 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is,
you have an eight

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.726 align:middle line:84%
in your soul, which
means you've learned

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:50.828 align:middle line:90%
the hard way your whole life.

00:53:50.828 --> 00:53:52.096 align:middle line:84%
But you don't like
the pity pool.

00:53:52.096 --> 00:53:53.464 align:middle line:84%
When someone feels
sorry for themselves,

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:54.331 align:middle line:90%
you're like, get up.

00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.332 align:middle line:90%
Let's figure it out.

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you true, honey?
You're on the money.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.268 align:middle line:90%
Girl, you better stop, OK?

00:53:58.268 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.705 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to deny
that you're on the money.

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:02.573 align:middle line:84%
That's me.
-Right.

00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:03.273 align:middle line:90%
Now here's another.

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:05.175 align:middle line:84%
You have a two, which
means you also need love,

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.344 align:middle line:84%
and people hurt you
deeper than they realize.

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:08.846 align:middle line:90%
Girl, where did you come from?

00:54:08.846 --> 00:54:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Come on down.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.582 align:middle line:10%
It's scary.
-All right.

00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:13.684 align:middle line:10%
So Glynis McCants
is here with us,

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:17.254 align:middle line:10%
and so is Gina Silvetti, who is
a producer of this show here.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:20.491 align:middle line:84%
And Glynis is going to
read Gina's numbers here.

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:22.759 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: What's
interesting for the pattern

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.895 align:middle line:10%
of what I just did--
like, I just read Melanie.

00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:27.464 align:middle line:84%
Melanie was born a one day
and she's a three life path.

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.066 align:middle line:90%
Gina's born on a one day.

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:30.634 align:middle line:84%
She's a three life path.
-Oh, funny.

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:33.303 align:middle line:90%
So already, similar energy.

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.037 align:middle line:90%
But it really is.

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:35.272 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, it's
common for energy

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.608 align:middle line:10%
to be drawn to
the same location.

00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:40.544 align:middle line:10%
Like, when I do a
workshop, it was very cute.

00:54:40.544 --> 00:54:42.980 align:middle line:10%
I did a workshop on the
weekend, and I said, raise

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.914 align:middle line:10%
your hand if you're a seven.

00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:45.716 align:middle line:10%
And I swear, all the
sevens were together.

00:54:45.716 --> 00:54:46.850 align:middle line:10%
Raise your hand
if you're a nine.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:47.818 align:middle line:10%
A pack of nines.

00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:49.319 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, wow.

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.554 align:middle line:10%
They find each other.

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:51.355 align:middle line:10%
They don't even know it.

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:52.623 align:middle line:10%
It's like, oh, this
feels comfortable.

00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll be here.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.225 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same energy.

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.894 align:middle line:84%
The difference is,
with you, Gina,

00:54:56.894 --> 00:54:58.195 align:middle line:90%
you have a seven attitude.

00:54:58.195 --> 00:55:00.631 align:middle line:84%
And seven is about
finding faith.

00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.733 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you need to
learn the actual message

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:04.701 align:middle line:90%
of saying let go and let God.

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:08.338 align:middle line:10%
It's like, I can't control all
of it, so it's not my problem.

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.374 align:middle line:10%
But the more you seek the
spiritual side of your life,

00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:11.975 align:middle line:10%
the happier you are.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.944 align:middle line:10%
And nature's beauty
is your buddy.

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:16.079 align:middle line:10%
Ocean, mountains,
plants, flowers.

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.215 align:middle line:10%
When you're around nature's
beauty, you are so happy.

00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:18.916 align:middle line:10%
That's true.

00:55:18.916 --> 00:55:21.785 align:middle line:10%
You could see, like, a perfect
sunset and have such joy.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:10%
It's like, look at that.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.588 align:middle line:84%
You get caught up
in the beauty of it.

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:28.225 align:middle line:84%
Like, even a bouquet of
flowers can you may go, whoa.

00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:30.160 align:middle line:10%
Look at the beauty of that.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.329 align:middle line:10%
And that's because you
have a seven attitude.

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:35.132 align:middle line:10%
You also have a seven for
your power name number.

00:55:35.132 --> 00:55:37.234 align:middle line:10%
It means you have a
great observation,

00:55:37.234 --> 00:55:38.969 align:middle line:10%
power of observation.

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:40.404 align:middle line:10%
Like, you could
be talking to me,

00:55:40.404 --> 00:55:41.905 align:middle line:10%
but you do have
the ability to kind

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.373 align:middle line:10%
of hear what else is happening.

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.008 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: That's why
she's such a good producer.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.577 align:middle line:10%
That's why she's an
amazing producer.

00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:47.244 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:48.879 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, the other
thing I'd save to you,

00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:51.248 align:middle line:84%
the numbers one, five, seven,
do make good producers.

00:55:51.248 --> 00:55:54.084 align:middle line:84%
You have a one, and
we have double seven.

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.485 align:middle line:84%
But your life path
number's three,

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:57.287 align:middle line:84%
and three is actual--
a communicator.

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.689 align:middle line:10%
So you should be able
to write as well.

00:55:58.689 --> 00:55:59.389 align:middle line:10%
I do.

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.325 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I mean, it's not going
to be hard for you to write,

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:03.660 align:middle line:10%
because putting things to paper
is like, here's what I think.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.795 align:middle line:10%
Here's what I want
to communicate.

00:56:04.795 --> 00:56:06.463 align:middle line:10%
And then you're really
good about editing.

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:07.798 align:middle line:10%
-That's what I do.
-Right?

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.733 align:middle line:10%
When I'm not producing, that's
actually exactly what I do.

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:11.268 align:middle line:10%
Because you go back
and go, OK, wait.

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:12.169 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't quite right.

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:14.638 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's not the
message I'm trying to project.

00:56:14.638 --> 00:56:15.572 align:middle line:90%
What's a better word?

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:16.707 align:middle line:10%
That's a three.

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:19.443 align:middle line:10%
You also love written word.

00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:21.778 align:middle line:10%
Like, if you come across a good
book, you fall in the book.

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:22.846 align:middle line:10%
-That's right.
-Yeah.

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.248 align:middle line:10%
And you don't want to leave it.
It's like, ah.

00:56:24.248 --> 00:56:26.617 align:middle line:10%
You miss it until
you're done reading it.

00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:30.120 align:middle line:10%
So the three is about a writing,
it's about communication.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:10%
It's certainly about this
field of communication.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.325 align:middle line:10%
Because remember I
said, if you're here

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:37.227 align:middle line:10%
to motivate and
uplift other people,

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:38.795 align:middle line:10%
how do you beat a
field like this one?

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:40.063 align:middle line:10%
-True.
-Right?

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.865 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And how are
we related in terms of--

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.333 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, exactly.
-Are we super compatible?

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.768 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what it is.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:90%
You're a 35 eight.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.171 align:middle line:10%
And so when we talk
about a life path number,

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:50.207 align:middle line:10%
because you have a three
right behind it-- like,

00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:51.875 align:middle line:10%
Sandra Bullock, by the
way, is a 35 eight.

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:52.576 align:middle line:10%
Sandra Bullock.

00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:55.312 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you don't love her,
something's wrong with you.

00:56:55.312 --> 00:56:57.681 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the woman, what
she's been through,

00:56:57.681 --> 00:57:01.084 align:middle line:10%
what she's been through and her
adopting that sweet little boy.

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.352 align:middle line:10%
But it's the 35 eight.

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.754 align:middle line:10%
So three is a natural performer.

00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:06.189 align:middle line:10%
She's got the three, so she's
going to encourage that.

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:07.824 align:middle line:10%
It's about cheerleading
each other.

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:09.059 align:middle line:10%
Very much so.

00:57:09.059 --> 00:57:11.128 align:middle line:10%
And then the fact that
you're born with the energy

00:57:11.128 --> 00:57:12.396 align:middle line:10%
of two, the 29th.

00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:10%
And then she's got the energy
of one, which again means,

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:16.400 align:middle line:10%
let's just figure this out.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Like, it's magic.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.268 align:middle line:10%
When I talk about
one, two, three--

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.671 align:middle line:10%
whenever you see one, two,
three around people, it's magic.

00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:21.838 align:middle line:10%
Well, she's got the one three.

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.006 align:middle line:10%
You've got that two.

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:25.042 align:middle line:10%
So it's like, what can
we do to produce magic?

00:57:25.042 --> 00:57:26.943 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is magic here.
-Right.

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.613 align:middle line:84%
But it also means
when it goes wrong--

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:32.015 align:middle line:84%
like, you're really good
at trying to prevent

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:32.983 align:middle line:90%
it before it happens.

00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:35.585 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're really about,
I know this could go wrong.

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:37.220 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, how do I prevent it?

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:40.691 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the
lessons for you, again, is

00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:41.992 align:middle line:90%
being too critical of yourself.

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:43.226 align:middle line:10%
It's like, you do
this great job.

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:45.529 align:middle line:10%
One thing goes wrong, and
then you're haunted by it.

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:48.799 align:middle line:10%
Because the numbers one, five,
and seven never stop thinking.

00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:50.133 align:middle line:10%
You've got double seven one.

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.902 align:middle line:10%
Which means at
nighttime, when you

00:57:51.902 --> 00:57:53.737 align:middle line:10%
feel like you're lying in
bed you're like, oh, my gosh.

00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:55.472 align:middle line:10%
Did I do everything
that had to be done?

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:58.208 align:middle line:10%
Do I really have
permission to sleep?

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.676 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: You are
just nailing this.

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:00.377 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:02.913 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Yeah, I've known
Gina for over a decade,

00:58:02.913 --> 00:58:05.115 align:middle line:10%
and she produces the
radio show as well,

00:58:05.115 --> 00:58:05.916 align:middle line:10%
the award show as well.

00:58:05.916 --> 00:58:07.517 align:middle line:10%
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Well, and
yet, notice something.

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.353 align:middle line:84%
Here I said-- I started
with explaining,

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:11.288 align:middle line:84%
that gal was one on one
day three life path,

00:58:11.288 --> 00:58:12.689 align:middle line:84%
yet look how different
the reads are.

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's so interesting.

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.726 align:middle line:90%
We have to wrap this up.

00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:18.228 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you, it's
magic in the numbers,

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:22.566 align:middle line:84%
and I so appreciate you
being here and joining us.

00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:23.767 align:middle line:90%
And thank you Gina Silvetti.

00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:25.102 align:middle line:10%
GINA SILVETTI: Oh,
thank you, Lisa Garr.

00:58:25.102 --> 00:58:26.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.938 align:middle line:90%
My wonderful angel.

00:58:27.938 --> 00:58:29.005 align:middle line:84%
All right.
GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yes.

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
GINA SILVETTI: This is my angel.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.241 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a love
fest right here.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.576 align:middle line:90%
