>>LISA GARR: Are you
waiting for someone else

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:10%
to solve your problems?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Or are you waiting for
someone to save you,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:90%
to make you feel happy?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.455 align:middle line:84%
Transformational leader Kute
Blackson says there isn't one.

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
No one's coming to
save you or rescue you.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It's actually you.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You are everything
you've been looking for

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and this world is
waiting for you.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:10%
Kute tells the story in
his latest amazing book

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:10%
called "You Are The One."

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KUTE BLACKSON: It's
great to be here.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.767 align:middle line:90%
You are the one.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: No, you are the one.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, you are.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: We are the one.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:90%
You have an amazing background.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:90%
You grew up in West Africa.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.890 align:middle line:84%
What was your life like
when you were a boy?

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.072 align:middle line:84%
I was born in
Ghana, West Africa.

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:90%
My father's from Ghana.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Mother's Japanese.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I pretty much grew up in London.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We had to leave Ghana
because of a coup.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
My father was the
spiritual teacher

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
to the president of Ghana.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so my first memories as a
young boy was a deep calling.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.878 align:middle line:10%
I felt this deep
burning desire to make

00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:10%
a difference in people's lives.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know what it was
going to look like but I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:10%
felt this burning feeling.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of my first memories,
being a chubby kid in Ghana,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
West Africa, I was
lost in the crowd

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and I literally saw a crippled
woman crawling on the floor.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
She picks up the sand this man
walks on, wipes it on her face

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
and stands up.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, week after week, I grew
up seeing blind people see,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and deaf people hear, and people
stand up out of wheelchairs.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The man whose sand
she picked up,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:84%
he would look at a woman in a
wheelchair and say, stand up.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
The woman would say, but I
haven't walked in 20 years.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Stand up.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.728 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe?

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
If you believe, stand up.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And, boom, she would stand up.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So this man was my father.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:90%
He built 300 churches.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Even more, maybe a few
more, in Ghana, West Africa.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:10%
Huge church in London, UK.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:10%
And he probably had
300,000, 400,000 followers

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.267 align:middle line:10%
in his congregation at the time.

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were the only child?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I was
the only child.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Watching all this.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.292 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I saw
all this happening.

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was normal.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Miracles were normal.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The supernatural
was just my reality.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I would go to school and I'd
tell my teachers and my friends

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
about the miracles
I saw on Sunday.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Nobody believed me.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
One Sunday, my teacher
came to my father's church

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and she saw this amazing thing
happening and had to apologize.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very unique
upbringing but very

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.148 align:middle line:90%
normal for me at the time.

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Normal is-- were you in
these congregations where you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
would be a part of the prayer,
and the ceremony, and the--

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: No.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I was the kid.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
At eight years old, I just
wanted to play soccer.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Sunday service was five,
six hours on a Sunday,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
clapping and singing and my
dad preaching for four hours.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was making
noise in this foyer

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of the lobby of the church,
until one day my father

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.015 align:middle line:84%
had someone drag me and
put me on the front row

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:90%
and had me sit there.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I was falling asleep, age eight.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
Sunday, my father

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
says to the whole
congregation, my son

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to give the sermon,
and they threw me onstage.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.813 align:middle line:84%
That's when my speaking
career began at age eight.

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
They threw me onstage.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
was happening.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, something
came through me.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Words came through me.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I just dissolved and
people started crying,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and that was the beginning of
the beginning of my speaking.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how
I feel when I speak.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not there.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.825 align:middle line:90%
I literally get out of the way.

00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's what started it.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
14, my father also

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
announced to the
congregation, my son

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.082 align:middle line:90%
is taking over my ministry.

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did he
consult you on this?

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: No
conversation whatsoever.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
My father and I, we
weren't so close.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
He was out there serving
the world, so I loved him.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But when he announced
to the congregation,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
my son is taking
over, my heart sunk.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Because as much as I wanted
to make a difference,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
as much as I wanted
to serve people--

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and this is all I knew--

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
deep down, I knew in my heart
that this was not my path.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I felt something wasn't aligned.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.727 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what else to do.

00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
From a young age,
age eight, I started

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
reading literally hundreds of
books in terms of psychology,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
spirituality, meditation.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.095 align:middle line:84%
My first book was by a woman
called Shakti Gawain, "Creative

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:26.895 align:middle line:90%
Visualization."

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mine too.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Age eight, right?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mine too.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.863 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: She was like--

00:04:29.863 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:90%
give me five.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
She was like the original.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Think-- if you can
believe it and see it,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
then you can achieve it.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how I started,
reading Shakti Gawain, Ernest

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Holmes, Unity, Charles Filmore,
people like Johnnie Colemon.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.125 align:middle line:84%
Old school metaphysicians,
Joseph Murphy, Neville Goddard.

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
To the Western, Wayne Dyer,
Louise Hay, Deepak Chopra.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, spirituality,
personal growth was my passion,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.448 align:middle line:84%
and asking myself the questions
who am I, and why am I here,

00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
and what's the purpose of life.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I look at life and
I knew it wasn't right.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
There's some things-- we all
have an experience-- maybe it's

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
a relationship we're
in, maybe it's a job,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's a business
dealing-- where

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:90%
we know something isn't right.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything logically wants
to go in that direction

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:90%
but something isn't aligned.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I knew it wasn't aligned.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
I wanted his love.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid that if
I honored my truth,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid if
I spoke my truth,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid if I dared to be
who I really was and tell him,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Dad, I don't think this
is my path in life,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that I would lose his love, I
would lose the relationship,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I would be outcast,
I'd be alone,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd lose the connection
to the community.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So I literally,
somewhat consciously,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
suppressed my truth
deep inside for years.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It took me four years of
suffering and internal turmoil.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we know when
something isn't aligned.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
dishonor ourselves,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
there is no greater
betrayal, there

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is no greater pain that arises
from not honoring our truth.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was going
to leave school

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.542 align:middle line:84%
when I was 16 because I figured
life has more to teach me.

00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I chose not to go to
university, which already

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.995 align:middle line:90%
was a very abnormal decision.

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It went against the culture
and the collective desire

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:90%
of my community.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But I looked into
my future, Lisa,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and I literally saw I could
take the expected path.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I could follow my father's
vision for my life.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I literally
felt the pressure

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds of thousands of
people, the expectations.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there's no
shortage of people in life

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that will think they know
what your life should be,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that they think they
know who you should be

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and how you should live, and
it takes a tremendous amount

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
of courage to follow your
truth, to follow your knowing,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.592 align:middle line:84%
when everyone around
you is pressuring you

00:06:49.592 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:90%
in a certain direction.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You didn't
just have him.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
You had--

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I had
the expectations.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I was the guy.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked
into my future and I

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
saw myself at 28, and
38, and 48, and 50.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
trajectory of my life

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and I saw I might be successful
by everyone else's standards,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.795 align:middle line:84%
but if I didn't have
myself, then I had nothing.

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your realized
that 18 years old.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I felt
the pain of that.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Then I looked into the unknown
and everything felt deeply

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
authentically right, but it
was just like a black void of I

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what I'm
doing, where I'm going.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
But inside, it felt right.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So I had to make peace
with I have no idea.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to make peace
with the unknown,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and I chose to have a
conversation with my father.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
One day, I literally
went into his bedroom.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I had
to first make peace

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
with letting go of my
relationship with him.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I had to decide.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.273 align:middle line:84%
Like I may never have
a relationship with him

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and I had to make
peace with that.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.523 align:middle line:90%
That was number one.

00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I finally had the
conversation with him.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that moment
must have been--

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you write about it in your book,
where you said to your mother,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go up
those stairs and I'm

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.315 align:middle line:90%
going to talk to my father.

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:90%
What was that like for you?

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Terrifying.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew what I had to do
in my heart, in my soul.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
There was no question
my soul was pulling me.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But the day I
decided, I remember

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I walked up the stairs of my
tiny apartment where we lived.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
My father was lying on
the bed, just sleeping.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I tapped him on the shoulder.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:90%
My mother was behind me.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I felt her support.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
This was the moment my entire
life was about to shift

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and shifted.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I tapped him
on the shoulder.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dad, I have
something to tell you.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
He said, what, my son?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
feel I'm meant

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
to take over your churches.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:90%
I kind of mumbled it.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:90%
And then he said, are you sure?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:90%
He said, are you sure?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was
going to scream.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It was worse.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.067 align:middle line:84%
And it was the scariest,
at least until that moment,

00:08:57.067 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
it was the scariest
moment of my life,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.108 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
I'm about to lose

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
my relationship with my father.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:90%
We didn't speak for two years.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It was terrifying.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you feel relief.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: I felt relief.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I felt nervous.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I felt excited.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was the
right decision.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But there was also
a lot of pain,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I felt like I
was letting my father down.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you
do right after that?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like
you could go back to--

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I sat in my room and
stared at the wall in silence.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there
was no turning back.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Because even if I told my
father, oh, that was a mistake,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:90%
the bond is cut at that moment.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a huge
destiny choice point.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think in life we
have moments of choices

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:90%
that our soul has.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.285 align:middle line:90%
And I think we have to be--

00:09:51.285 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we think we
have to get rid of fear

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and have no fear in
order to move forward.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I believe that, no.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you will
feel the fear,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and the way through the
fear is through the fear,

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.647 align:middle line:84%
is to feel the fear and
step through the fear.

00:10:01.647 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And by stepping through the
fear and having the courage,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:90%
that you expand your capacity.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of how I
see people like Gandhi.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
They probably felt fear but
they kept stepping through.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And then they expanded.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They kept stepping through,
they kept expanding.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.842 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's when greatness

00:10:16.842 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is a moment-to-moment choice,
and that was a choice for me.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.383 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Because most people run away
from fear and confrontation

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and that moment, and I
don't want to have that.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And you just go into it and
into it and make it alive,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
and you confronted it right on.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And it started at an
early age for you.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge lesson.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I think
keeps us stuck and unhappy

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
are literally all the ways
that we lie to ourselves, all

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the ways that we BS ourselves.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
We rationalize, we
don't tell the truth.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm in a
relationship and it's OK.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We cope.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.593 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: We cope.

00:10:55.593 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We make it OK,
when, deep down, we

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
know this relationship
is no longer aligned

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
with who I am today.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
This relationship is
no longer honoring me.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we've invested
so much time in this--

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
10 years, 20 years, 30 years--
that what will people say?

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there's that fear,
of letting go of the known,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
letting go of
what's comfortable.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we work a job and
we know it's not right.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We know it doesn't
give us the opportunity

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to express our gifts, our
heart, our true purpose.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.723 align:middle line:84%
But we stay because
we're afraid how

00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
am I going to pay the bills?

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to survive?

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.833 align:middle line:90%
So, for me--

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fear keeps us stuck.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.333 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Fear keeps us stuck.

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we have to
be willing, as a first step,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:90%
to tell the truth to ourselves.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Selves.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Ourselves first.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: That is
like key number one.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I say happiness is easy.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It's actually-- no.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is simple,
not always easy.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Feel the truth, own the
truth, acknowledge the truth,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:90%
tell the truth, live the truth.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Happy life.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.435 align:middle line:84%
But not always easy
because of human fear.

00:11:57.435 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You hear
people say that.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, I've
got the best life.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't understand why I'm
so deeply unhappy, because it

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:90%
looks great from the outside.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Sometimes people
think, oh, you follow your path

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and the unicorns come
out and it's easy.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And everything is the
spontaneous fulfillment

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:90%
of your desire.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when you follow
your path and your purpose,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%
you will face challenges.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Those challenges are simply
the preparation for your soul

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to develop the soul
muscle, the soul force,

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to face
the challenges

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.082 align:middle line:84%
and what it's
going to take to be

00:12:31.082 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:90%
able to fulfill your purpose.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't speak
for two years.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
It was very difficult.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: During those two
years, what did you do?

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:90%
You came to California, right?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: So we didn't speak.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
oh my goodness.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
God, what am I going to do?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
My feeling was, universe,
you've given me this vision.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Because I felt a vision, Lisa.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You had the faith.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.687 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: I had the faith.

00:12:52.687 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I had a calling.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I felt this purpose.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had
to come to the US.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.063 align:middle line:84%
I had to come to Los
Angeles because this

00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
is where all the
authors who wrote books

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.188 align:middle line:84%
were living, the Tony Robbins,
the Louise Hays, the Chopras,

00:13:04.188 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:90%
the Marianne Williamsons.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to come and
find these people.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:90%
And so one day I said a prayer.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, universe, God,
you've given me this vision.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, if
this vision is true,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I have no support.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I have no money.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Literally within 24 hours--

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I was in the library--

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:84%
someone hands me a magazine
called "The Economist."

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I feel chills.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We always have to
follow the clues.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.942 align:middle line:90%
I feel these chills.

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I look in the back
of the magazine.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.317 align:middle line:84%
It says the American
government is giving away

00:13:32.317 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
55,000 green cards in
the green card lottery.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything in my soul
said, you're going to win.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Enter it.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.573 align:middle line:84%
But many times, we feel this
intuition but we don't follow.

00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Always say
there's no way.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: There's no way.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a hoax.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Our mind
gets in the way.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was naive.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%
I was 18.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I entered it.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Cut a long story short,
three months later

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I was told I won a green card.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I literally won a green
card in a lottery.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, was the
sign from the universe

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:90%
that I was being guided.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The day I found out,
I was so shocked,

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%
and celebrating, and excited.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.275 align:middle line:90%
And I heard a voice say--

00:14:08.275 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:90%
it's in a voice--

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
why do you seem so surprised?

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Did you not know?

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:90%
You knew.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Trust your knowing.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
That was a moment where
I knew I was being

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.952 align:middle line:90%
guided throughout my life.

00:14:19.952 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it took a
while for that green card

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.868 align:middle line:90%
to come through, right?

00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you doubt when
it didn't come through?

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Every day I
would run to the mailbox.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally
drew on a piece of paper

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
a card colored green and
put my face and name on it.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:90%
I was visual--

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I read Shakti Gawain's
"Creative Visualization."

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I was visualizing
myself in America.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I was visualizing the
president of the US--

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I think Clinton at the time--

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:90%
welcoming.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.882 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize I wasn't
going to get a welcome.

00:14:48.882 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So I was visualizing
all of these things.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know
that window shut

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.555 align:middle line:90%
after that happened to you.

00:14:52.555 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: And every
day, no confirmation

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:90%
until the very final day.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The very final day is
when I got a phone call

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.745 align:middle line:84%
from the lawyer I applied
through, that said,

00:15:01.745 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
you won a green card.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And that gave me a knowing.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So I realize any time
I've doubted, any time

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.425 align:middle line:84%
even since then, when I've lost
faith or question-- because I

00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
think we all question, is
my dream going to happen?

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Is my soulmate going to happen?

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to happen for me?

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I see it happening for
all these other people.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I go back to that
moment and I remember.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
You didn't come this far to
be left where you are now.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.297 align:middle line:84%
And so that moment
gives me a lot of faith.

00:15:25.297 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you didn't
lose your faith in between.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to
learn from that.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Because things don't
happen in the time

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that we order them to happen,
when we want them to happen.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And your faith was
probably tested many times.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Many.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Like many times over the last 20
some years I've been in the US,

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:84%
my faith has been
tested over and over.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not it's not like you read
a book or you write a book--

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great to hear.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.095 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: --and it stops.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized is
sometimes when your dreams

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
don't manifest--
because it does happen--

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
we get depressed, we
lose faith, we give up.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.455 align:middle line:84%
For me, there's a few
things that it means when

00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
your dreams don't manifest.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I would say is
it might mean that your dream

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or what you think is
your goal, vision,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and dream is
actually not aligned

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
with your highest purpose.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just you think you want
that car, or that house,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:84%
or that project, or to
be that actor or actress,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really the
most authentic expression

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
of what you are here
to do in your lifetime.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
push and you push

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and you push for that TV
show and it doesn't happen,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.508 align:middle line:84%
or that project,
it doesn't happen,

00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean something's wrong.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It just means you have
to maybe dig deeper,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:90%
feel deeper, feel into what is--

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:90%
maybe there's something more.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something else
that you're really meant to do,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:84%
so we have to be willing
to surrender and let go.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
sometimes it's just timing.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my life,
for the longest time,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I wanted the book to happen.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
For the longest time, I
wanted TV projects to happen.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:90%
They weren't happening.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But I realize now sometimes
things not happening is grace,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest blessing
from the universe.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Because had they
happened in the time

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted them to
happen, I wasn't ready yet

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and it would have
probably been a disaster.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember one
of the first music videos

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that you did, and it had
almost a quarter million views.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And this was like 2004?

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: 2009.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Nine.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:90%
When you came--

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: First year.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was really too-- we have
a clip here I want you to see.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Just take a look.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It's really truly
feeling into you.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: When you
were first conceived,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
you were a double strand of
DNA in a fertilized ovum.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:10%
Dividing 50 times, you had
over 100 trillion cells,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:10%
more than all the
stars in the Milky Way,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:10%
and you were born
into existence.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Each of your cells do over 6
trillion things per second.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Just think how a
human body knows

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
how to kill germs, digest,
make babies, and talk,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.948 align:middle line:90%
The miracle is you.

00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:32.985 align:middle line:90%
The miracle is you.

00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:90%
So realize, visualize.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all inside.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:90%
a galaxy of amazement.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Should you ever forget,
just close your eyes

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.112 align:middle line:90%
and listen to the music.

00:18:56.112 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Just listen to the
music deep inside.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the music.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the music deep inside.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:90%
The miracle is you.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.914 align:middle line:90%
The miracle is you.

00:19:15.914 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember you speaking
about that at a conference

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that we were at, and you showed
that video and the whole room

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:90%
wept.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:90%
It was so real and truly--

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
was that when you started
to really utilize media

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and your own type of influence?

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Lisa, I
was pushing for so long

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to be on television,
because I felt

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:90%
like I'm meant to do media.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be the next
Oprah, with a TV show.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I write about it in
my book, in a talk show.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.583 align:middle line:90%
And I was offered a show.

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I turned it down because
it didn't feel right.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I just kept pushing
and things weren't opening.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.377 align:middle line:90%
Finally, I had to surrender.

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And I had to say, you know what?

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
else that the universe is

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:90%
seeking to express through me.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
And I had to trust that.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got
a whole new vision.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
That's when this music video
idea came, using videos, using

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:90%
visuals, using media.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And, really, that's how I
built my career and business,

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
was through videos
and the visual medium.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:90%
That was the beginning.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know, it makes
sense because your message

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and your passion needs
to really come from you.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It can't fit into a structure or
a talk show format or anything.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:90%
It really needs to be from you.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And you are so passionate
when you speak,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
it spoke to people
and in their hearts.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've
since then gone on

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to do these incredible
things, but it

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
comes from a place where you
are just authentically yourself.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
When you come up against these
blocks, what is your practice?

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.815 align:middle line:90%
What do you do to go inside?

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Blocks
are not only--

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
like, when you say blocks, I
want to be really specific--

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.123 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not working.

00:20:58.123 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Like when something's
not working.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.637 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it's you?

00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you--

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: When something's
not working for me,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.887 align:middle line:84%
it's just feedback
from the universe.

00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: And so I don't
take it as, oh, something's

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:90%
wrong with me.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not enough.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:90%
God doesn't love me.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm cursed.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I really try and take the
feedback from the universe.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if outer experience is a
reflection of my inner reality,

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
the way I see it
is life is a mirror

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences of life are
really reflecting to me myself.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there is no
world out there.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
There's just me out their
projected back to me.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, essentially,
I'm in relationship

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
with aspects of myself in the
form of a person, a situation,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:90%
or an experience.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if something is not
working, rather than just work

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
hard out here, what
I try and do is

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
go inside here and
look at what is

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:90%
this showing me about myself.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:84%
What is this mirroring
to me about myself?

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to
change inside of myself?

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, I
often say, if you

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
want to see what is going
on in your unconscious mind,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:90%
look at your reality.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the scale,
life, the scale,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
the weights that you might
step on, doesn't like.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
The mirror doesn't lie.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Give me an example.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: If you're
attracting people

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
into your life that are
constantly disrespecting you,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
if you're attracting a
relationship partner that

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't show up, isn't
available, doesn't commit,

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and it happens over and over
and over and over and over

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and over and over and over
again, sometimes you can say,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:90%
well, it's him.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all the men in the world.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.503 align:middle line:90%
It's all the women in the world.

00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is, you and I, I'm

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the common denominator
in this situation.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be
willing-- when I get stuck,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I have to be willing to take
full responsibility for myself

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror and
change myself first.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
have learned to do

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:84%
in taking full
responsibility is I ask

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:90%
myself an interesting question.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If what's showing up
is what's showing up,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
then, on some
level, maybe there's

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.168 align:middle line:84%
a part of me that wants what's
showing up to be showing up.

00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To learn from it?

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: To learn from it.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I ask myself, why would
I want this to not happen?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Why would I want to not
manifest the situation?

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
unconscious resistance

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's some
unconscious fear.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And so why do I actually
not want to manifest this,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm doing
everything to manifest it?

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.365 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Maybe there's a fear
of, if I put myself out there,

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be exposed.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a fear of,
if I put myself out there,

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I might fail and that's
going to be painful.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's easier to not
put yourself out there and have

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:84%
things happen, because
then you can always

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
hang back and have the future
possibility, and fantasy,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and hope of something happening.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But not
really commit to it.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: But not
really commit to it.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's usually a reason
things don't manifest.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to be willing
to dig in and explore.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.253 align:middle line:84%
So life, for me, is just
a feedback mechanism.

00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's huge,
because most people

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.795 align:middle line:90%
could go in a victim.

00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's them.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:90%
They decided this.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that happened to me.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.073 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was out of my control.

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard to
take responsibility.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It really appears that it's
out of your control completely.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then that step of
taking responsibility

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.783 align:middle line:84%
of how are you
showing up in this

00:24:12.783 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
makes the difference between
a good life and a great life.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big difference.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a huge difference.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.965 align:middle line:84%
And you say we're here
to live our greatness.

00:24:21.965 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And you say in your
book, which I love,

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.805 align:middle line:90%
life is waiting for you.

00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So who are we not to
be that greatness?

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean that
it's waiting for us?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I mean, many
times we're waiting for life.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting for things to show
up, or waiting for the soulmate

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to love.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting for
to make enough money

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to start being able to give.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting to heal
ourselves completely in order

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:90%
for us to give our purpose.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe life has already given
us everything that we need

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:90%
to begin living our purpose.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.742 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we
have to lose the wait.

00:24:51.742 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop
waiting and I think

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:84%
we have to start where we
are with who we are exactly

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:90%
with what we have and begin.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:90%

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You started at two years, you
didn't talk to your father.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:90%

I didn't wait till
I was perfect.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't wait till I
had it all together.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't wait till I
had some big following.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I just began and
I started small.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And how it started was I had
a pure desire to help people.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I had the pure, sincere
desire to make a difference,

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and that desire goes a long way.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe that your
dreams choose you.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams choose
us for a reason

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
because we are the
perfect person.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
People might think,
I'm not perfect.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You have don't have to be
perfect as in personality

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
perfect, because,
ultimately, there

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
is no perfection at the
level of the personality.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:84%
There's perfection at
the level of the soul.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But what I believe is
every single thing that's

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
ever happened to us, every
pain, every trauma, every hurt,

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
every divorce, every
screw-up, every heartbreak,

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is just the ingredients that
the cosmic chef, the universe,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
has been sprinkling
to prepare us,

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to prepare our
mind-body mechanism,

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.178 align:middle line:84%
to be the person who
is able to fulfill

00:26:12.178 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
the dream and the vision.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So I believe our
dreams choose us.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's
anything that I've

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.758 align:middle line:84%
done that I would invite
everyone watching to do,

00:26:19.758 --> 00:26:21.550 align:middle line:84%
the first thing is when
you feel the dream,

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to
acknowledge the dream.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:90%
You have to acknowledge it.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have to realize
it doesn't belong to you.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to life.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
belong to life,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
then you, in your
human-limited self,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be fully
responsible for actually

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling it.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:90%
It's life's responsibility.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to be responsible for
being the best that you can be.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to be responsible
for showing up.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But if the dream
belongs to life,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:84%
then life knows how to
fulfill itself through you.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:90%
But we have to say yes.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:90%
We have to show up.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to
get ourselves out of the way

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and let life unfold
and be willing to take

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:90%
the actions necessary.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:90%
So I showed up.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I came to America.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Two suitcases.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I knew no one in the country.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Landed at LAX.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Literally got dropped
off on Venice Beach,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:90%
at Venice Beach Cotel.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Not even a motel, Lisa.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
A cotel.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Cried for two weeks
feeling so lonely.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I
was being guided.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.613 align:middle line:84%
Beyond my fear, beyond my mind,
there was a deeper impulse.

00:27:24.613 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
There was a deeper guidance.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And then so I went
on my journey.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I traveled.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.285 align:middle line:90%
I explored.

00:27:29.285 --> 00:27:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I went through my
own personal journey,

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
which we can talk about.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But then there came a
point when I just began.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
How my career began is I
started to help one person.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.777 align:middle line:90%
I coached one person.

00:27:40.777 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you might have been
working an odd job to make ends

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:90%
meet but you started talking.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: I started talking.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me I
started-- my trajectory

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
was I started getting
around people in my field.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried
to do was I wanted

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
to learn from a lot
of people in my field.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So I knocked on people
like Jack Canfield.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I literally barged
into his office.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I rode a bus to Culver City.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:90%
He probably forgets.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I hope he's not watching.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I barged into Jack Canfield's
office unannounced.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.380 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea who I was.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.343 align:middle line:84%
And I refused to leave until
Jack Canfield met with me.

00:28:15.343 --> 00:28:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Somehow I thought he
knew me because I've been

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:90%
reading his books as a kid.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.292 align:middle line:84%
And they literally refused
until I refused to leave,

00:28:21.292 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden he came
out like two hours later.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down with him
and many people like.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I just showed up at people's
houses and Deepak Chopra's

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:90%
office, and on and on.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat with
some of these people.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people, I
learned to serve and add value,

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and would hold their
bags at their seminars.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So, first thing, I
got in proximity.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I got around some
of these people

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
as a way of being blessed,
as a way of learning,

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:84%
as a way of adding value,
as a way of observing.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I began.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And so even though
I had nothing,

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:10%
I gave what I had with what
I had, even though I maybe--

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:10%
some of these people let
me into their seminars.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.108 align:middle line:10%
I had no money.

00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:10%
I just showed up and said,
I don't have any money

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:10%
but I want to help.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Can I hold your bags?

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Can I run the tables?

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Can I do you logistics?

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.907 align:middle line:90%
Can I do your meeting.

00:29:06.907 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you need me to do?

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll hold the door.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.558 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that really
is what I had going for me.

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your willingness.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.933 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: My willingness, yes.

00:29:14.933 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And your desire.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
But, really, you chose life.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You didn't
look for the obstacles.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You looked for every
opening you could find.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.137 align:middle line:90%
Look, our dreams choose us.

00:29:25.137 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we can do
it at the micro level.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.432 align:middle line:84%
As you said, one
person at a time.

00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be on
big stages or whatever.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.558 align:middle line:90%
You can really do it.

00:29:31.558 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But we all have this
birthright as our greatness.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this video where
Kute is talking about that.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: We face some
challenging times ahead.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.913 align:middle line:84%
Old systems and
paradigms collapsing.

00:29:45.913 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.155 align:middle line:84%
You have been born at this
exact time for a reason.

00:29:53.155 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:02.930 align:middle line:90%
It's time to wake up.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:10%
Each generation
has its challenges

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and each generation
birthed great leaders

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:10%
that rose to meet them.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.438 align:middle line:10%
Gandhi, MLK, JFK, Mandela.

00:30:27.438 --> 00:30:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: Because
I've been to the mountaintop.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Leaders who
moved humanity forward

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:90%
with their visions.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:10%
The real heroes aren't angels
in the sky but those that

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:10%
dare to love and serve boldly.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:10%
You don't need a lot of money.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to be famous.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:10%
You don't need a PhD.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
You just need to start
with who you are.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Greatness isn't reserved for
the select few, gods among men.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
It's you that the
world is waiting for.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.180 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:10%
You are ready.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.550 align:middle line:90%
You are the one.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take people
through these journeys,

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
like you hear, and
you show people

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that they can return
to their own power.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Many people
come to you who

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
have lost that way, who have
lost their sense of that power.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Easy to do, I have to say.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Life knocks you down.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a ton of messages
saying you're not good enough.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You can wear this, or
be that, or do this

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be good enough.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you help them?

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I lost my way
or I feel like there's more.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes it's not so
clear, like I lost my way,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's just I feel
like I'm here for more,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and I either don't
know what the more is

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.005 align:middle line:84%
or oh I feel stuck in breaking
through to getting to the more.

00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:84%
See, the way I see it is,
we're all whole, perfect,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and complete.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We're all magnificent
beings of the infinite.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But, in many ways,
we get conditioned

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
life and we lose touch

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:90%
with our magnificence.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:90%
We're born as children--

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:90%
you have a beautiful daughter.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:90%
We're born, and she's so bright.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We're born, these
amazing light beings.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.137 align:middle line:84%
We come down from
the heavens and we're

00:32:50.137 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:90%
in touch with our essence.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll jump on a table and
we'll sing and we'll dance.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't care if we're not
Bruno Mars or Celine Dion.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Or we'll run around naked.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't care that I'm fat.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:90%
We're just full of love.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:90%
But what happens?

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, the
first step for people

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is we have to become aware that
we are profoundly conditioned

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and that who you are might
not be who you think you are.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what are
the personas, what

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:84%
are the layers of conditioning
that perhaps you have

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.900 align:middle line:90%
learned as survival mechanisms?

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really survival mechanisms,
being the funny person,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the good person,
the nice person,

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.230 align:middle line:90%
the over-responsible one.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I was the preacher's kid,
so I was the good boy.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these ways, we
learn as children to survive.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
They work for us
when we're five,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:84%
when we're 10, when
we're 15, when we're 20.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And they help us
function and survive

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and maybe thrive, to a
degree be successful.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think there reaches a
point where we end up limited.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It and it ends up limiting
our full expression.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And so people often come to me
feeling, without being aware,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
they kind of feel
there's so much inside

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:90%
of them that just can't quite--

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I need to be this for
that person and this for this.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They can't quite get
out of this thing.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope people become
aware and unravel and unknot

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
themselves and peel the
layers away so that they

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:84%
can allow the true
essence of their soul

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:90%
to express freely in the world.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is
real power, a power

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of beingness that can then
express in their lives.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So you take them
on these journeys

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.898 align:middle line:84%
where you strip
them of everything.

00:34:21.898 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: No phones, no
laptops, no communication

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:10%
with the office.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Just a backpack.

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.583 align:middle line:84%
I got known because I
created a journey to India.

00:34:31.583 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't do it much any more.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But for about seven years
I did 19 journeys to India

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:84%
called the Liberation
Experience.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
And I would take a kind of
high-level visionary, a leader,

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:84%
someone in a position of
power, because I wanted people

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:84%
in positions of power
to be transformed

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.097 align:middle line:84%
so that, from their
transformation,

00:34:47.097 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:84%
they could come back
and make an impact.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I take away your passport.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I take away your money.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:84%
You have a backpack,
a pair of clothes,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.245 align:middle line:90%
no idea where you're going.

00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I make you sign
your will in case

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
you don't come back,
basically face death.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I make you write letters to
everyone in your life in case

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:90%
you don't come back.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, of 19 journeys,
everyone came back.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have to
be willing to face death.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So many of us, we're
so afraid of dying.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're so resistant
to the thought

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
of dying that I think it limits
our full capacity to live

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:90%
fully.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the keys to freedom

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.560 align:middle line:90%
is making peace with death.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So I like to tell people,
make death your friend.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Bring death to tea.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Have some tea with death.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And you'll realize, ultimately,
the true essence of who

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you are, your soul, your
being, is beyond birth,

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:90%
is beyond death.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.155 align:middle line:84%
The question is not
whether we're going to die.

00:35:43.155 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's whether we're
going to live.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lee, Bob Marley, Muhammad
Ali, Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi,

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Mother Teresa, David Bowie.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, you and
I, we will die.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We all have one
thing in common--

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
The question is how will
we use this precious time?

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I have people face death
so that they can make peace

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:84%
with death and then get on
with the business of living.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you take them into
situations that are dangerous?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I create--
in India, it's

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
a 14-day, 24/7
experiential immersion,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.680 align:middle line:90%
one-on-one process in India.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would create situations,
and India would create

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:90%
situations spontaneously.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
architect situations

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:84%
based on what I felt
was some of their fears

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:90%
and their resistances.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.558 align:middle line:84%
Because, many times,
we think we're

00:36:31.558 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:84%
free until you take away
someone's iPhone, and someone's

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.118 align:middle line:84%
clothes, and someone's
makeup, and someone's control.

00:36:37.118 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:90%
And now they're in the unknown.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And we think we're free.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But if your freedom,
I told people,

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is based on things
outside, then it

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is a pseudo-freedom, because
everything in the world

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:90%
is temporary.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It's transitory.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
For me, Nelson Mandela
accessed the deep freedom.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:90%
26 years in prison.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Still free in his
being, not allowing

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.588 align:middle line:90%
himself to be bitter or angry.

00:37:00.588 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure he
went through a process,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.090 align:middle line:84%
but able to come out and
be compassionate and love.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:11.323 align:middle line:84%
That is a freedom that is not
dependent on anything outside.

00:37:11.323 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
For me, that's real freedom.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So my vision in
creating these journeys

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
is to help people access
an inner freedom that

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is unshakable, not
dependent on anything.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I create situations
and experiences

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and put people in situations
that bring up their stuff,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and then I help them
identify, transform,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and heal through their
patterns of conditioning.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.677 align:middle line:90%
That must be intense.

00:37:33.677 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Intense.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intense.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.707 align:middle line:84%
But they come out
completely changed.

00:37:37.707 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Totally transformed.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Really transformed.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it lasts.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not a workshop.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: No, no.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep dive, one-on-one,
24/7 experiential journey.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And now I do it in
Bali with 20 people

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
at a time, people from all
walks of life, which is amazing,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and fun, and intense.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, I feel
like we all are here

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and put on this planet
at this unique time.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:84%
We're living in intense times,
this unique time in history,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:90%
because we--

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.238 align:middle line:84%
the world is waiting
for our gifts.

00:38:06.238 --> 00:38:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
about the stories?

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hear
people's stories

00:38:09.163 --> 00:38:10.330 align:middle line:90%
and where they've come from.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're smiling.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You smile when I talk
about people's stories.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.220 align:middle line:90%
They've had a hard life.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:90%
People have had hard lives.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You're still smiling.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: I'm smiling
because, I think, on one level,

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.670 align:middle line:90%
we have all had hard lives.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Life is hard.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Life is challenging.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Life is not easy on one level.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think, on a deeper
level, we all incarnate

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.180 align:middle line:90%
into this human experience as--

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:90%
we're souls.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And we incarnate into this
human experience, I feel,

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:90%
because life is a school.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to
grow, learn, and evolve.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And how we grow, learn, and
evolve are through experiences.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And some experiences
are very painful.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.867 align:middle line:90%
So I see life as a classroom.

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I think many of the
challenges that people face--

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:84%
pain, death, trauma,
divorce, all of these--

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:84%
they are lessons
that we have been

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:90%
born to learn and grow through.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't just
look at experiences

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.950 align:middle line:90%
on the surface as good or bad.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I really look at
things on a soul level.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.517 align:middle line:84%
And when I see someone going
through a very difficult

00:39:19.517 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
situation-- like I've been
in India and seen some people

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in deeply challenging
situations--

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:84%
it taught me to really have
deep respect for their soul.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:84%
When I saw this
handicapped person in India

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
crawling upside down,
first time I went to India,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I felt such pity.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized he's
taken the PhD program

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime, this soul.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:84%
When I look him just as a
personality, It's like, wow.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I feel sorry.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.910 align:middle line:84%
That's not nothing
to smile about.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But when I really
realized what kind of

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.850 align:middle line:84%
soul would choose this
intense situation--

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I could do it.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
What kind of soul would
choose this intense situation

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:90%
to go through?

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Handicapped, no legs, no
eyes, in India, poverty.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.005 align:middle line:84%
That is an advanced level
course of the human experience.

00:40:12.005 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to, rather
than feeling sorry for people

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
or feeling bad for
people, started

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to have a deep respect for
another soul and their journey.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
someone's soul journey is.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I just know we are
all on a soul journey.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You spoke to
this person, right?

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Not interviews but,
through a translator,

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:90%
asked deep questions.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:90%
One time, I was in India.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:90%
This was before my journeys.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.530 align:middle line:84%
This is when I was
on my personal quest

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:90%
about 17 years ago.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I put everything in storage,
got rid of all my possessions,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:90%
broke up with my girlfriend.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.527 align:middle line:90%
I was offered a TV show.

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I chose not to take the TV show.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I got a little depressed
because I felt like things

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:90%
weren't working out in my life.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that I was not
going to come back to the West,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to America, until I found
certain answers for myself.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
for my own self,

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:84%
not because of what Gandhi
said, or Mandela said.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know for
myself what truth was.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Traveled to India in
a quest of happiness.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Himalayas,
high and wide.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in Bodh Gaya,
where the Bodhi Tree is where

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:90%
the Buddha got enlightened.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw these 10 beggars
one day, lined up.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'd been there two weeks.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I paid these
beggars no attention

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.280 align:middle line:84%
because I thought my great
breakthrough was going

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to come from some wholly
enlightened guru guy sitting

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:90%
on a mountain.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And there were these 10 beggars
there and it was 120 degrees.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying, Lisa.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting depressed
by the moment

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:90%
on a quest for happiness.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I see this one beggar.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.350 align:middle line:90%
They're all begging for money.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And here's this one beggar
sitting on the floor

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and he's singing.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he is singing his heart
out like praises to his god.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.143 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
he was saying,

00:41:49.143 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:84%
other than-- you
know when someone

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:84%
is singing from such a depth
of soul that it moves you?

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I was so moved by this
man I started to cry.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at him and
I realized he was blind.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought, my god,
he can't even see

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:90%
how much money he's getting.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.970 align:middle line:84%
He can't even see if anyone
is appreciating his singing.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And tears just uncontrollably
started flowing from me.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I looked at him and he
was beating the drums

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.270 align:middle line:90%
with stumps for arms.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.780 align:middle line:84%
He had no arms and he was
beating the drums, singing.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't go to the
toilet by himself.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't eat by himself.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.775 align:middle line:90%
I just broke down even more.

00:42:21.775 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Then I looked more closely.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The reason he was
sitting on the floor

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:90%
was because he had no legs.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They told me the
story of this man.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:84%
They told me that certain
parents in parts of India--

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
this was very poor
part of India--

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.840 align:middle line:84%
sometimes deformed
their kids because they

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.080 align:middle line:84%
stand more chance of making
money begging this way.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:90%
My heart broke open.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at this man, I
realized he was not a beggar.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.910 align:middle line:90%
I realized I was the beggar.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I hold my
gifts back, whenever

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting for some special
moment in the future, whenever

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I try to protect
myself and don't

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.020 align:middle line:84%
give my love with the world,
I am begging from life.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I was so moved I went
up to this man and I said--

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I knelt in front of him
and looked him in the eyes.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.113 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't see me but I
felt like he looked right

00:43:06.113 --> 00:43:07.050 align:middle line:90%
into my soul.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:09.812 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
how do you do it?

00:43:09.812 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Every day, how do you--
because I realized he'd

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.910 align:middle line:90%
been coming here every day.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you come here every
day and give your gift?

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:84%
My friend doesn't
call me back one time,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I get rejected one time,
I'm mad at the world.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm mad at God.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to give up.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And here you are just
singing your heart and soul.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.897 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Every day.

00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was singing, and he
looked at me and he said,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:90%
what else is there to do?

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And he kept singing.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, he's true.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
What else is there to do?

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Then he looked at me
again and he said,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
sometimes life might
give you what you want

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and life may not give you
what you want sometimes.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But you can always
give life who you are.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:84%
For me, my heart my
heart just exploded.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
why I do what I do.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And I realized--

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He's the gift.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: --I have met the
richest man in the world.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Because he was giving his gift.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I think real
happiness is not when

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you are trying to get from
life, acquire from life

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.610 align:middle line:84%
but when you are
giving your heart.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:90%
You're giving yourself.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:90%
You're in service to people.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:16.343 align:middle line:84%
Because you take nothing with
you at the end of your life.

00:44:16.343 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you don't share
those gifts with the world,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:90%
then they're all for nothing.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: For nothing.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We chose to incarnate
and we don't share the gift

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:84%
with the world, and
you leave this planet

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're just going to
come back into it again.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a phenomenal
teacher and a beautiful man,

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that you were able to see
it and you wrote about it

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.633 align:middle line:84%
in your book to share
him with the world, which

00:44:38.633 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I think is incredible.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: His gift lives on.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it does,
continues to live on.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: And
so you never know

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.525 align:middle line:90%
how your gift will touch people.

00:44:45.525 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's right.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.082 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: He has no idea that
his gift is reaching hundreds

00:44:49.082 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of people.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.116 align:middle line:90%
Had no idea.

00:44:51.116 --> 00:44:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do it,
because I believe

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that there are
people waiting for us

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are people
that need to hear

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the message, or the
teaching, or whatever

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it is we want to give
in the way that only

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.280 align:middle line:90%
we can uniquely give it.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One person at a time.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: One
person at a time.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then if you
inspire that person,

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.907 align:middle line:84%
they could go on and inspire the
next and the next and the next.

00:45:12.907 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But it does take getting out
of our story of what we've

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.938 align:middle line:90%
told ourselves or experienced.

00:45:17.938 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And as you said,
bad things do happen

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and people die and it's painful.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
through this where

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:25.840 align:middle line:90%
your mother just recently--

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: My mother passed.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:84%
My mother passed away
about 14 months ago.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And here's a woman who--

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
her whole life
was about serving.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was deeply painful,
deeply challenging.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I live in LA, she
lives in London.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I was flying back to London
literally every three weeks

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.600 align:middle line:90%
to be with her.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
was, as painful as it was--

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and I grieved, and I cried,
and there were tears--

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.690 align:middle line:84%
it was the best year
of my life, because I

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:84%
got to sit in
chemotherapy sessions

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:84%
with my mother for eight
hours straight, Lisa,

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:84%
just holding her hand and
talking to her about things

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't talked to her
about since I was eight.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.455 align:middle line:84%
And her and I looked at
each other and I said,

00:46:08.455 --> 00:46:11.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have to
thank the cancer.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.950 align:middle line:90%
She had stomach cancer.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I had to thank cancer for
bringing her and I closer.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge blessing.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:84%
My only regret-- and I hope
everyone is maybe inspired

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.665 align:middle line:90%
by this piece--

00:46:23.665 --> 00:46:25.197 align:middle line:90%
and I loved my mother.

00:46:25.197 --> 00:46:26.530 align:middle line:90%
We had a beautiful relationship.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:31.210 align:middle line:84%
My only regret was not spending
enough time with my mother.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
That's my only regret
in retrospect now.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.180 align:middle line:90%
So I feel life is short.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Life is short.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:41.280 align:middle line:84%
None of us know when that
moment is going to come.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.710 align:middle line:84%
None of us know when
we're going to die.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know my mother
was going to die that year.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But when I looked her in
the eyes, it was amazing.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you afraid?

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
I'm not afraid.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm not this body.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm a spirit,
that this body is just

00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:02.130 align:middle line:84%
a temporary vehicle that my
soul is traveling through.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so what do you want?

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:84%
She said, I just
want God's will.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever God wants is
really what I want.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what I
learned from her in this time

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:84%
was what allowed her to
not suffer during her year

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.720 align:middle line:90%
that she had.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Probably my favorite
moment of my entire life

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.830 align:middle line:84%
was holding my mother,
looking her in the eyes,

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and letting her know-- it's
telling my mother, mom, thank

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.740 align:middle line:84%
you for the privilege
of being my mother.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
opportunity to know you.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I hope everyone watching
takes the moment to feel death

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:90%
because we don't know.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I hope everyone lets those
they love-- their kids,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:84%
their loved ones,
their parents--

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I hope everyone lets
them know how much they

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:84%
care, how much they mean to
them, because once it's over,

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.630 align:middle line:90%
it's over.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.672 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Coming back and
doing that to a parent is

00:47:56.672 --> 00:47:58.890 align:middle line:84%
so incredible,
sharing that moment,

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.485 align:middle line:84%
because they give so
much and selflessly--

00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Selfless.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --all the time.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyone knows that
that's a parent.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.438 align:middle line:84%
And how is your relationship
with your father now?

00:48:10.438 --> 00:48:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: It's beautiful now.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We were close but not so
close, but after this moment

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.840 align:middle line:90%
with my mother--

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.590 align:middle line:84%
my father and I had a few
butting head moments--

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I decided to just
totally drop it.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:84%
What I realized was, ultimately,
in life, the only thing

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.840 align:middle line:90%
that matters is the loving.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.390 align:middle line:84%
That is the only
thing that matters.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.570 align:middle line:84%
In any kind of like things I
thought he should have done

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.615 align:middle line:84%
and shouldn't have done,
and with her, honestly, I

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:39.240 align:middle line:90%
dropped it completely.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just chose to-- for me,
the shift happened even more

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:84%
so once she passed because
I chose to completely--

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.200 align:middle line:84%
this was the key to my
shift with my father--

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to completely accept my
father exactly as he is

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and as he isn't, that
he's not going to change.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I dropped all--

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean all-- expectations.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.607 align:middle line:84%
Look, luckily, he
wasn't abusive.

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different situation

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.390 align:middle line:90%
if someone's being abusive.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't what I
wanted him to be yet,

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but I dropped all
expectations, that

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:84%
then allowed me to
just receive whatever

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.610 align:middle line:90%
he was able to give me.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Which maybe is not everything
but it was something.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have an
amazing relationship.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I call him every single day.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.350 align:middle line:84%
My decision was the only
thing that matters is love

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and he has melted.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship
has transformed.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So I hope everyone, you just get
on with the business of loving,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
thing that matters.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing we're
going to care about.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The people in 9/11 had no
idea they weren't coming home

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that night to be able to look
their loved ones in the eyes

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and say I'm sorry.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't waste time.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the loved ones
who lost those people are also

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.375 align:middle line:84%
thinking that every day, that
they wanted that last moment

00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:56.250 align:middle line:90%
with their loved one.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.535 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
get so lost in life

00:49:58.535 --> 00:50:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that we forget to tell the
people that we are with,

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and they are alive.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: We take
them for granted.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:04.950 align:middle line:90%
We do love them, yes.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a question
and I just want

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to know how did your dad
deal with being a healer

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.365 align:middle line:84%
and not being able
to heal your mother?

00:50:14.365 --> 00:50:15.165 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Wow.

00:50:15.165 --> 00:50:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
challenging for him.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a
profound gift and humbling

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.100 align:middle line:90%
lesson for him.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Look, I think everyone
has their journey,

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.600 align:middle line:90%
and he has his journey.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I really actually
believe that my mother

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.270 align:middle line:84%
passed away first-- she
had to pass away first

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because her soul actually
wanted to gift my father

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.520 align:middle line:90%
and I a closer relationship.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:43.870 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:45.703 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: And so, for
me, it was beautiful

00:50:45.703 --> 00:50:48.720 align:middle line:84%
because I got to take my mother
from London back to Ghana

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.590 align:middle line:90%
to reunite them.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
still together but

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.740 align:middle line:84%
they were living
in separate places.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.510 align:middle line:84%
She was looking after
the church in London.

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And that they got to complete
their relationship together.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they started their
relationship together

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:02.942 align:middle line:84%
in a crazy way
40-some years ago.

00:51:02.942 --> 00:51:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And they got to end their
relationship together

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.540 align:middle line:90%
in the most beautiful way.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a beautiful--
you look at it as a gift.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It was a gift--

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Profound gift.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --all around.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: Yes.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And for you too.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you continue to
give that gift to people.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So if people are
looking for a way

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:21.182 align:middle line:84%
to find that truth, that beauty,
that love within themselves,

00:51:21.182 --> 00:51:22.140 align:middle line:90%
how can they get there?

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.598 align:middle line:84%
What types of
questions can we ask?

00:51:23.598 --> 00:51:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: You know, there's a
lot of questions, but I think,

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.440 align:middle line:84%
in a simple way, as I said
earlier, one of the things

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us stuck
are the ways we don't

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:90%
tell the truth to ourselves.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that we first have

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
to begin by telling
the truth to ourselves,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.870 align:middle line:84%
or at least beginning
that exploration.

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:84%
First question I
would invite people

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to sit with is, what
lies am I telling myself?

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.970 align:middle line:90%
What lies--

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you even know?

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: A simple ques--

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to feel.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I think you start-- you
know that something is off

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because something
feels off inside.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Or you feel some
kind of dissonance.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You feel pain, you feel
guilt, you feel shame,

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:90%
you feel depressed.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:11.630 align:middle line:84%
All of these negative feelings
are actually blessings.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.460 align:middle line:84%
All of these negative
feelings, I think,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.460 align:middle line:84%
are signals that so often
we do not pay attention to.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:90%
We distract ourselves.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:90%
We social media it away.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.140 align:middle line:90%
We work it away.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:90%
We shop it away.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:22.820 align:middle line:90%
We sex it away.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.690 align:middle line:90%
We eat it away.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We do whatever it
takes to not feel

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.440 align:middle line:84%
this uncomfortable
negative feeling--

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.110 align:middle line:84%
sadness, anger, hurt,
resentment, what have you--

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.540 align:middle line:84%
when they are trying
to tell us something.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.662 align:middle line:84%
Feelings are simply signals that
we need to pay attention to,

00:52:36.662 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that, if we don't
pay attention to,

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.840 align:middle line:84%
grow and manifest
in different ways.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.760 align:middle line:90%
If you don't speak about them.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: And so
that's how we know.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.578 align:middle line:90%
It may not be this big thing.

00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It might just be like
something's off inside.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.670 align:middle line:90%
So listen to the signal.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So what lies am
I telling myself?

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, we know, Lisa.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:90%
How many times--

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't have
to be a confession.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But how many times have we been
in a relationship in the past

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:05.290 align:middle line:84%
where you met someone
and it wasn't--

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:06.090 align:middle line:90%
is this the one?

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this not the one?

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.707 align:middle line:84%
The moment you broke
up with that person

00:53:08.707 --> 00:53:10.430 align:middle line:84%
after years of going
back and forth,

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:84%
you told your best friend,
I knew that was never

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.920 align:middle line:90%
going to work out.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of us, we knew
the moment we met that person.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:90%
We have this knowing.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to trust
that still feeling, sense,

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:90%
intuition inside of us.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:24.740 align:middle line:90%
So deep down, we do know.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So what lies am
I telling myself?

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.990 align:middle line:84%
What am I pretending to
not know is a key question.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:84%
When am I pretending
to not know?

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have to want the truth
more than we want what we want.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:90%
We have to want the truth.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Or let me rephrase that.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:90%
We have to want the truth--

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More than the lie.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: More than the lie.

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Or want the truth more than
we want what we think we want.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It could be disrupting,
though, the truth.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.922 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: It can
be dis-- so, look,

00:53:51.922 --> 00:53:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I ask people in my events
and seminars, what do you

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.840 align:middle line:90%
want more than anything else?

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you want more
than anything else?

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.352 align:middle line:84%
Many times, we don't want the
truth more than anything else

00:54:03.352 --> 00:54:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because we're afraid
of the consequences.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.650 align:middle line:90%
But if we really want--

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:10.050 align:middle line:84%
if your child was on the
line, what's the truth?

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:10.850 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So be willing to be
ruthless, uncompromising,

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.150 align:middle line:90%
non-negotiable with the truth.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With yourself.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.843 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKSON: With yourself.

00:54:17.843 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
What am I pretending
to not know?

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.330 align:middle line:90%
What is this lie costing me?

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, be
willing to feel the cost.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Be willing to feel the pain.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Many times, we know something's
off or we know it's a lie

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.230 align:middle line:90%
but we distract ourselves again.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to feel the
pain of what it's costing us,

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.590 align:middle line:84%
because we know
if we feel it, we

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:41.370 align:middle line:84%
might have to do
something about it.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And so to actually sit in the
pain of the acknowledgment

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.090 align:middle line:90%
of the lie.

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And I say even if you're
not willing to do anything

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.450 align:middle line:90%
about the truth, feel it.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Let it burn.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Burn in the truth, because
then it's only a matter of time

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:84%
until something will stir
and you will eventually

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.800 align:middle line:90%
start moving.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:84%
At least tell yourself,
this is the truth.

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I hate my job.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm too afraid to do something
about it because I'm not sure

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.140 align:middle line:84%
how I'm going to survive,
but I know I hate my job.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And then you end confusion.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes play this
game of confusion.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.550 align:middle line:84%
This game of I don't
know when we do.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So what is it costing you?

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And actually feel.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:84%
What am I really afraid
of if I tell the truth?

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes what we think we're
afraid of is not even that

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.600 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when we actually
face it, we ask ourselves,

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:90%
was that it?

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.720 align:middle line:84%
It was not as bad as I
thought it was going to be.

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All this
amounts to an explosion

00:55:38.893 --> 00:55:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and then you regret
the explosion.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you really
take care of it

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.722 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to your
truth along the way,

00:55:43.722 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't come out as
that burst at the end

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.880 align:middle line:90%
where you do regret it.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.338 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: Or
sometimes we make up

00:55:49.338 --> 00:55:50.990 align:middle line:84%
this kind of negative
future fantasy

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.495 align:middle line:84%
about the worst
case scenario that's

00:55:52.495 --> 00:55:54.620 align:middle line:84%
going to happen that never
actually happens or it's

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.138 align:middle line:84%
nowhere nearly as
bad as we thought.

00:55:56.138 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:84%
We freak ourselves
out in the moment.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're just living in
that space of that anticipation

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.570 align:middle line:90%
of it happening.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKSON: We're
living in it now.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes when you can
face the worst case and go,

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:08.940 align:middle line:84%
this is the worst case
of telling the truth.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose this person.

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose this situa--

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:90%
can I deal with that?

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Many times, if you
can really face that,

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.140 align:middle line:90%
there's a profound free--

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I can deal with that worst case.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.013 align:middle line:90%
There's a profound freedom.

00:56:22.013 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I
invite people to sit with

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is, what amazing
thing might happen?

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
What incredible thing
might happen by telling--

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe you lose this
situation or this person,

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.430 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you meet your
soulmate as a result.

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And so amazing
things can happen.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I think manifestation is not
really a matter of trying

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.710 align:middle line:90%
to make things happen.

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I think everything is already
happening in the universe.

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Manifestation is
actually clearing away

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.920 align:middle line:84%
all of the blockages that really
prevent us from being our most

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.770 align:middle line:90%
authentic self.

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring
ourselves into alignment--

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.400 align:middle line:84%
you can't be in alignment lying
to yourself and living a lie.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in alignment
with your truth-- mind, body,

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.420 align:middle line:90%
heart, soul, spirit--

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and living that, then life, and
experiences, and situations,

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and the next level of your life
start to gravitate towards you.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so relationships.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.900 align:middle line:84%
You talk a lot about
relationships and help people

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.518 align:middle line:90%
through the men breakthrough.

00:57:15.518 --> 00:57:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you call it?

bit more about men

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.793 align:middle line:84%

this beautiful video

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
people about women.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, tell us what's the
inspiration behind this video.

>>BLACKSON: My life, honestly,

and inspired by amazing women.

Somehow, it just may be
my karma in this lifetime,

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.330 align:middle line:84%
from my mother, to
relationships, to just friends.

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gotten to
maybe know women and have

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:84%
a sensitivity to women, and
I've just been blessed by women.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:58:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's just through my
appreciation for the feminine

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.440 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to write a piece.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's, I think, a letter to men.

here through a woman.

think, every thing you eat,

every feeling, every
emotion is going
