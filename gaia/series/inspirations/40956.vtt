>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.153 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
struggle everyday

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.423 align:middle line:84%
with sharing what they feel
or what they want in a way

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.525 align:middle line:90%
that they can really be heard.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.095 align:middle line:84%
And we simply haven't
been taught the effective

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:31.797 align:middle line:84%
communication skills or
the emotional vocabulary

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:35.102 align:middle line:84%
or even the self-awareness
needed to get unstuck

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.904 align:middle line:84%
in those challenging
moments or to prevent them

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.639 align:middle line:84%
from happening in
the first place.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.308 align:middle line:90%
My guest today, Bill Stierle,

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:84%
is a communications
specialist and a mediator.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:48.982 align:middle line:84%
And he's developed a link
between emotional intelligence

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.585 align:middle line:90%
and thinking styles technology.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.421 align:middle line:84%
And our show today is about
how to implement these tools

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.258 align:middle line:84%
to increase communication
peacefully and to navigate

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.661 align:middle line:84%
through conflict both at
home and in the workplace.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill Stierle: Lisa, it
is my pleasure to be here.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:08.802 align:middle line:84%
I feel grateful to be back
again connecting with you and--

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:09.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle:-- sharing
this information.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You know, what
you do is such a valuable,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.777 align:middle line:84%
valuable thing because we
are not taught these skills

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:21.214 align:middle line:84%
where we learn them from
whatever we observe our parents

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.982 align:middle line:84%
or relatives doing
when we're young.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, how did you get started
in teaching communication,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.421 align:middle line:90%
how did you dissect that?

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, it's been
an interesting journey for me.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.726 align:middle line:84%
A big part of it was, you know,
you ask a big question and all

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.961 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden you got
a big answer.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So, the first question
I started asking

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.067 align:middle line:84%
when I was teaching high school
science is why do people think

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.469 align:middle line:90%
the way they do?

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.605 align:middle line:84%
I really pursued this kind of
thinking, you know, mindset it's

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.475 align:middle line:84%
like 'cause I noticed that
some of my students were--

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.177 align:middle line:84%
really have a certain
gift at stuff.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:52.345 align:middle line:84%
When it came to testing, they
didn't really do very well.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.648 align:middle line:84%
So I kept asking
that question like,

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.016 align:middle line:84%
why are they thinking
the way they do.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:59.019 align:middle line:84%
It seems like they know a
certain kind of information

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.421 align:middle line:84%
and it was translating,
but it didn't show up.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.889 align:middle line:90%
So it led me to that kind

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.559 align:middle line:84%
of first step is why do
people think the way they do

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.562 align:middle line:84%
and that different parts of the
brain communicate and listen

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:12.299 align:middle line:84%
to vocabulary and even
use different definitions

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:90%
for the same word.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.036 align:middle line:84%
So misunderstanding can
take place very easily.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So where do we get
those frames of reference

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.707 align:middle line:84%
for different words and
what they mean to us

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.075 align:middle line:84%
versus what they
mean to someone else?

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Boy, there's
all kinds of expectation

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.081 align:middle line:84%
that a kid should know what
the word respect means,

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.218 align:middle line:84%
where they should know what
the word fairness means,

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.753 align:middle line:84%
they should know what
the word kindness means.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:90%
They really actually don't.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:36.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: They don't, yeah.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:37.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, they
don't and they're trying

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.393 align:middle line:84%
to make a word association
with the definition.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.496 align:middle line:84%
But clearly they'll have
a different definition

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.366 align:middle line:84%
and then they're-- it's a little
bit like, you know, soup there,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.101 align:middle line:84%
you know, like putting
different vegetables in

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.636 align:middle line:84%
and different definitions
with stuff.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.538 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, like,
how do they think that?

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.839 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, is

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.242 align:middle line:84%
that they're just
associating certain experiences

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.846 align:middle line:84%
or imprinting from their
parents or from the teachers

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.482 align:middle line:84%
or from their friends, and
they're just putting it

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.384 align:middle line:90%
in to their language soup.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So when you're a
kid and someone says share

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.222 align:middle line:84%
with your sister and
you get the little piece

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.558 align:middle line:84%
and they get the big piece
and that's their definition

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.126 align:middle line:84%
of share now, that's
what that means.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Boy, that's true.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.262 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem like
something I want

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:90%
to do very much now, does it?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How things get formed.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:19.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes, they are.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then,
how did you transfer

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.302 align:middle line:84%
into actually teaching this
level of communication?

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:26.439 align:middle line:84%
Where did you discover these
different ways of thinking?

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, the big
part of it was is that,

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.579 align:middle line:84%
is that I kept noticing
that thinking kept showing

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.148 align:middle line:84%
up in a different way and I
was watching the brain science

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.516 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.586 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into a very
powerful mentor that taught me

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:84%
about these are different
ways sort of thinking in it,

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:46.459 align:middle line:84%
it was a model that was actually
developed in General Electric--

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.197 align:middle line:84%
at General Electric and was used
in regarding some team analysis

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:55.001 align:middle line:84%
and communication and
meeting effectiveness

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.873 align:middle line:84%
and to understand how to do
job descriptions, you know,

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:02.876 align:middle line:84%
to put people in alignment
with what their strengths are.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:03.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Each other.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.244 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: What a surprise.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- it seems like a kind

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.481 align:middle line:84%
of personality profiling,
but it's not, right?

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.917 align:middle line:84%
It's a little different than
a lot of the models out.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.919 align:middle line:90%
So it's a brain-based model.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.021 align:middle line:84%
It's a physiologically-based
model that really talks

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:19.425 align:middle line:84%
about how thinking and
a very strong metaphor

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.394 align:middle line:84%
about that there's different
quadrants of the brain

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:25.198 align:middle line:84%
that think differently and
they light up and they energize

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in regards to these
different value sets.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So it is physiological,

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.337 align:middle line:84%
it's really different
quadrants of the brain.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.239 align:middle line:84%
And those different--
you can't really kind

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:90%
of separate the brain out--

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle:-- that much.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.879 align:middle line:84%
But the metaphor allows us to
talk about it a lot easier.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:90%
That here are different things

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.451 align:middle line:84%
that are activated
during different times

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:90%
of thinking that takes place.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And this
is called the--

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, it's called
the Hermann Brain Dominance

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:53.693 align:middle line:84%
Instrument is the tool that's
used to measure these things.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.762 align:middle line:90%
So, all right.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.163 align:middle line:84%
So take us through a little
bit about what this is

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:01.034 align:middle line:84%
and a framework around
the brain dominance model.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, the first step
is to understand that there's

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.339 align:middle line:90%
in the upper left part of brain,

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.243 align:middle line:84%
there is this very strong
logical analytical part.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then very-- and in the
lower left part of the brain,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.718 align:middle line:84%
there is more of an organizing,
detailing of different style

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, which is
very, very different.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.324 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's in the
lower right part of the brain,

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.327 align:middle line:84%
there is am interpersonal
style of thinking

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.597 align:middle line:84%
or a connecting style of
thinking and communicating.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:32.665 align:middle line:84%
And then, the upper right part
of the brain, there's more

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.668 align:middle line:84%
of a synthesizing and a
holistic style of thinking

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:84%
or big picture communication,
more speaking in an overview.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:40.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.242 align:middle line:84%
And so these are kind of the
four quadrants that we're going

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:43.877 align:middle line:90%
to go into and learn all about

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and there's foundational
elements around all of this.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.915 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:50.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yes, and so
these foundational elements,

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.153 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
happen in communication is

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:59.058 align:middle line:84%
that thinking is very much--
there are four different kinds

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:02.595 align:middle line:84%
of communication that
goes that takes place.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.697 align:middle line:84%
There's a thinking
style of communication,

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a behavior
style of communication,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a belief
style of communication.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.672 align:middle line:84%
That a person is going to
advocate and communicate

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:16.209 align:middle line:84%
for their belief, or someone is
going to advocate or communicate

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.379 align:middle line:84%
for their need, or someone is
going to advocate or communicate

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.747 align:middle line:90%
for their thinking style.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.949 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to take a look
at these three things today

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.718 align:middle line:84%
and take a snapshot of them and
then have a little bit of fun--

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- you know, taking
a look at what they look like

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:29.789 align:middle line:84%
and how it looks in
real time, you know.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And then--

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:31.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: How do you figure
this out in real time with--

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:32.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's so great--

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- because it
helps me understand where I

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.597 align:middle line:84%
and how I think and
then, communicate,

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.132 align:middle line:84%
and then who I'm
communicating to.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to take
a quick look at a video

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.904 align:middle line:84%
of Bill teaching this
model, take a look.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:47.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: [Background Music]
There isn't one conflict

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.878 align:middle line:84%
that I can't turn the corner
between 17 and 23 minutes.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.415 align:middle line:84%
One board asked me
to make an analysis

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.685 align:middle line:84%
of their executive chain and
the comment from the board was,

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:03.289 align:middle line:84%
"You have taught me more about
my people in the last two hours

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.525 align:middle line:84%
than I've had sitting
in all the board meeting

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:06.659 align:middle line:90%
up to this moment."

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.695 align:middle line:84%
The best way to change
a belief is replace it.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.331 align:middle line:84%
I've seen companies like
worth would go from 20 million

00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:14.968 align:middle line:84%
to 230 million in two
or three-year period.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you said the word
"millions", you are done.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:84%
When we were doing the
walkaround activity,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:84%
this is the CEO position
in the center of the brain,

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.745 align:middle line:84%
what we were doing is we
were trying to isolate

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.848 align:middle line:84%
and identify different
communications styles.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.483 align:middle line:84%
Pick two colors that
are most like you.

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Donnie Nips: My name is
Donnie Nips [assumed spelling]

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:35.822 align:middle line:84%
and I am a green first
and a red second.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The green card
thinks in a very structured way.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.928 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a yellow and a red.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The yellow card
is the entrepreneurial card,

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.233 align:middle line:84%
the marketing card,
the branding card.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:51.604 align:middle line:84%
>> I am definitely yellow, quite
bit of red, a little bit of blue

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.006 align:middle line:90%
and not much green at all.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The blue
group, that would be

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.278 align:middle line:84%
like the engineer group
that's thinking logical,

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.846 align:middle line:90%
rational, analytical.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.448 align:middle line:84%
The red group is
adversarial to that group

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:06.019 align:middle line:84%
because they're thinking
interpersonal and feeling base.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.121 align:middle line:90%
All right, you ready blue team?

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.255 align:middle line:90%
You ready red team?

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:12.792 align:middle line:84%
Pick a bullet and read
the bullet under expect.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:16.129 align:middle line:84%
See what happens to you
and see how you're affected

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:90%
by it emotionally.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.433 align:middle line:84%
I do see a lot of hard
moments especially

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
when they start catching
the main reasons why their

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.139 align:middle line:84%
communications have
failed in the past.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:27.874 align:middle line:84%
>> This training with
Bill has been phenomenal.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:28.908 align:middle line:90%
It allowed me to kind

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:32.111 align:middle line:84%
of reidentify my
personal strengths.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:35.548 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never had a class
that was so engaging, so fun,

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.017 align:middle line:84%
and then I could use what
I've learned right away.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:42.221 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had a number of
very component sales trainers

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.391 align:middle line:84%
over the years, Bill
knocked it out of the park.

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:46.926 align:middle line:90%
He's by far the best.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: One of the things
I'm really confident about is

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that I know that I
can get your results.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:84%
How did you connect
to his message?

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
When I think about TD
Waterhouse, when I think

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.603 align:middle line:84%
about Occidental
Petroleum, when I think

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:59.739 align:middle line:84%
about Notre Dame University,
I know that I can come in

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and help your organizations to
have effective communication

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to increase
productivity and effectiveness.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.581 align:middle line:90%
Say nothing I did was wrong.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing I did was wrong.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It was his green.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:12.819 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell me
a little bit more

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.691 align:middle line:84%
about the whole brain
system, about how this works.

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:21.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So in communication,
the main part about it is,

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.264 align:middle line:84%
is that from a blue,
from the upper left part

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:27.433 align:middle line:84%
of the brain really
focuses on brief clear

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.836 align:middle line:84%
and precise informations,
really interested

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:32.905 align:middle line:84%
in that bottom line
fact that goes on.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Whereas opposite of
that, in the lower right part

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:40.213 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, there
is a strong tendency

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:44.317 align:middle line:84%
for I really want interpersonal
connection, I want to know

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that my needs and the needs
of others are considered.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.555 align:middle line:84%
And those are very, very
different because one is looking

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.992 align:middle line:84%
for sentences no--
not over seven words,

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.427 align:middle line:84%
please and the other
one is looking

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
for two paragraphs including
the story about my uncle

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:84%
that happens to know, you know,
of my cousin that has a cat.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:03.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: There's all these
connections stuff that's

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.537 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.572 align:middle line:84%
So those are two
very, very different.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:09.208 align:middle line:84%
It's like you put an
engineer and a social worker

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.244 align:middle line:84%
in the same room together
and they're talking--

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Talking totally
different languages.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- different
languages.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:15.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And the other parts

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.883 align:middle line:84%
of the brain are
talking very differently.

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:19.318 align:middle line:84%
So the upper right part of
the brain is going to speak

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:23.022 align:middle line:84%
like an overview or a
conceptual framework are taught

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.592 align:middle line:84%
from this big picture
synthesizing style,

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:30.229 align:middle line:84%
whereas the communications
coming from the lower left part

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:33.866 align:middle line:84%
of the brain is the step by step
unfolding the topic, one, two,

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:37.904 align:middle line:84%
three, four, five, you know,
written schedule action plan,

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:40.073 align:middle line:84%
I want to do my sequence
and I'm going to do

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.441 align:middle line:90%
that throughout the day.

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that's the only
way I can look at the world is

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.644 align:middle line:90%
through that sequence.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, because it
provides a sense of certainty

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.648 align:middle line:90%
and trust throughout my day.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.451 align:middle line:84%
The other style is going
to be more like an artist,

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.052 align:middle line:90%
a big picture thinker.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:56.756 align:middle line:84%
And then, the green
style is going to be more

00:10:56.756 --> 00:11:00.293 align:middle line:84%
like a drill sergeant or
somebody that thinks mostly

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:02.095 align:middle line:84%
like that is going to
be more structured.

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:02.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Very organized.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:06.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, can you have
more than one thinking style?

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:84%
I saw that in the video,
it had a couple, a lead.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:13.706 align:middle line:84%
You'll have one primary
that would lead

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:17.243 align:middle line:84%
and the way the population
and the database,

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.812 align:middle line:84%
there's about the
2.3 million people

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:22.715 align:middle line:84%
that have taken the
survey worldwide.

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:26.686 align:middle line:84%
And about 58 percent
is double dominant,

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.055 align:middle line:84%
that means they combine
two and they don't do

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.723 align:middle line:90%
as much of the other two.

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then about 34
percent is triple dominant,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:84%
and has a balance of three but
one of them is distinctly lower.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:38.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:39.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then,
single dominant is

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.334 align:middle line:84%
when they're just
mostly like one,

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.836 align:middle line:84%
like my engineer would
be mostly like my blue.

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:47.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: My social worker is
going to be my-- like my red.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.941 align:middle line:90%
My artist is going to be my--

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.011 align:middle line:84%
like my yellow and my drill
sergeant is going to be like a--

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.413 align:middle line:90%
so, that five percent--

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:55.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, so it's
significantly lower.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:56.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:00.153 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a group that
has a balance of all four,

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:90%
about three percent

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.656 align:middle line:84%
of the population is
a balance of all four.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Interesting,
very interesting.

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:07.894 align:middle line:84%
So, the way that you'll
be able to identify this

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:84%
with yourself is if
you're more of a feeler,

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:13.432 align:middle line:84%
you're more of the red, we have
these quadrants that you have--

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- the quadrants
is what ourselves looks

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.503 align:middle line:90%
like in this particular slide.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:21.174 align:middle line:84%
So, the feelings self,
the experimental self,

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:24.677 align:middle line:84%
the rational self and the--
what is the green one?

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The green one
is going to be organized--

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:29.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and
detailed sequence.

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:30.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Sequence.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Those are--

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:32.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- the things
that are going to be there.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:33.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK, great.

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.254 align:middle line:84%
So, these are the filters
when which we see the world.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.857 align:middle line:84%
It's how we communicate, it's
how we parent, it's how we work

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:41.427 align:middle line:84%
in relationships, it's
how we work in our jobs.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.095 align:middle line:90%
How else does this--

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:43.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- affect--

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:47.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: We're going to
be attracted to jobs that are

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.602 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
what our strength is.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:53.172 align:middle line:84%
So, if I take an engineer
and I mix it with an artist,

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:54.974 align:middle line:90%
I'll get a research scientist.

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:58.244 align:middle line:84%
If I take my blue and my
yellow, I'll get a stock broker.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: If it's someday
that can analyze something,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.649 align:middle line:84%
blue and then, see the big
picture and take a risk

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:84%
in yellow, I then can
put them together,

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.086 align:middle line:90%
I'll get a stock broker.

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:09.989 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and if I take an
engineer and I mix it

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:12.425 align:middle line:84%
with a drill sergeant,
I get an accountant.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:12.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:14.026 align:middle line:90%
That's within--

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:14.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- or a
technical manager,

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:15.661 align:middle line:90%
so I'm mixing them together.

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:16.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.897 align:middle line:90%
What if you were an employee

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:21.868 align:middle line:84%
and you're the red
quadrant touchy-feely,

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:84%
and you're boss is the
intellectual rulekeeper?

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:30.977 align:middle line:84%
Do those-- How do those
learn to communicate?

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's where
it gets interesting.

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:35.181 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part of my
consulting practice is going in

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:84%
and teaching teams how
to communicate better

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.353 align:middle line:84%
and it's not-- the
rule is, is that

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:43.189 align:middle line:84%
and the think I live the new
belief is it's not personal,

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.791 align:middle line:84%
it's preference,
very simple sentence.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:84%
But it really makes
a big difference.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.728 align:middle line:90%
It's not personal.

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:50.563 align:middle line:90%
It's somebody being direct.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:51.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, that's interesting.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's
their preference.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's their preference.

00:13:53.266 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's
their preference.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.103 align:middle line:84%
It's not personal that
somebody is telling a story.

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:58.571 align:middle line:90%
It's their preference.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, according to
this slide, you really--

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:03.676 align:middle line:84%
if you look at that person
on their view of the world,

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.946 align:middle line:84%
so my boss has a very
intellectual perspective

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:07.914 align:middle line:90%
on life.

00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:09.081 align:middle line:84%
It's not a personal
attack on me,

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:11.083 align:middle line:84%
that's the way he
views the world--

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:12.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- that's
what you're teaching.

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
He or she is going to have that
world view or that snapshot

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.027 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to see
it not as a full picture.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.229 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
see it as a skew.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.698 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to skew
towards one part

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.601 align:middle line:84%
of these thinking
values or another part.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:34.507 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- the main thing
is to get people used to,

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:37.877 align:middle line:84%
to standing in their strength,
not thinking they need

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.279 align:middle line:90%
to become a balanced person.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:44.183 align:middle line:84%
Being come balanced has a whole
another set of problems to it

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.785 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
not good at anything.

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:47.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah, that's true.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You're more in the
center, you know, you're not--

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Undefined.

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You're undefined
'cause you got to move

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.692 align:middle line:90%
and just -- and by the way,

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:54.794 align:middle line:84%
that person has a whole
different advantage

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
than the person that's
sitting in one strength,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.165 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get a
little bit into

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Interesting,
interesting.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.335 align:middle line:84%
OK. So now, knowing
that people look

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.669 align:middle line:90%
at the world in different ways--

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- you have
this great slide here

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.506 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
able to read.

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:09.275 align:middle line:84%
What is your intention
with this slide?

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Oh my gosh.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.043 align:middle line:90%
This is a hilarious slide.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.511 align:middle line:84%
So, would you like
to try to read it?

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, I did.

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I read it--

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, read it
out loud, see what happens.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:15.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Can you read this?

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Only 55 people out of 110 can.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.554 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe that I could
actually understand what I

00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:22.955 align:middle line:90%
was reading.

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:26.459 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenal power of a human
mind according to the research

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:30.162 align:middle line:84%
at Cambridge University, it
doesn't master in what order,

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:33.933 align:middle line:84%
the letters are worded in--
oh God, I've lost my place.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.934 align:middle line:90%
Will keep going?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:35.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah please.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh really?

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:36.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:37.837 align:middle line:90%
You may.

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:40.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I doesn't matter
what order the letters--

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.908 align:middle line:90%
the letters in a word are.

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:45.277 align:middle line:84%
The only important
thing is that the first

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.913 align:middle line:84%
and the last letter
be in the right place.

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:50.549 align:middle line:90%
The rest can be a total mess

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:84%
and you can still read
it without a problem.

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:56.288 align:middle line:84%
This is because the human mind
does not read every letter

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.758 align:middle line:84%
by itself, but the
word as a whole.

00:15:58.758 --> 00:15:59.992 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, huh?

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:04.196 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I always thought
spelling was important.

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.199 align:middle line:84%
If you can read this, that
you have a strange mind too,

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Isn't that fun?

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:11.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now the reason why
I stuck this slide in here is

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:15.841 align:middle line:84%
because I-- I'll put this in
the training and I'll have--

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:18.511 align:middle line:84%
you know, after just, you
know, working with the group,

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I'll find a green
or a blue thinker,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.784 align:middle line:84%
somebody that's more
detailed or more analytical.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.952 align:middle line:84%
And they'll start stalling
about in the middle,

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.821 align:middle line:90%
or they'll even get fried even

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:34.226 align:middle line:84%
about the third paragraph
'cause their sense of detail,

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
they want to correct it and
they want to structure it.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.667 align:middle line:84%
So, what happens is, is that
my right brain people will tend

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.937 align:middle line:84%
to read it in a very easy
flow and not really get hung

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.605 align:middle line:90%
up on the details of it

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:49.275 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing exactly
what the study says.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:51.343 align:middle line:90%
So they're in the 55 percent.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:52.912 align:middle line:90%
As your brain got tried

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I
pushed you through it--

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- your-- the green
part of your brain is going

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.951 align:middle line:84%
to like, wait, wait,
you know, like hold on.

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.519 align:middle line:90%
You know, gosh, go like--

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- want to
stay in this overview.

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:03.889 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do the green
detail and your brain--

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.858 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, I
don't want to do the detail.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:09.228 align:middle line:90%
That's like kind of pushed you

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:15.668 align:middle line:84%
through it is 'cause what our
brain does is that it gets stuck

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:20.538 align:middle line:84%
because whatever our superpower
is, whatever our strength is,

00:17:20.538 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:90%
it wants to run the day.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:26.278 align:middle line:84%
I wants to-- I want to step into
what I'm good at and I want to--

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:30.216 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do in
what I'm not good at.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right?

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Right.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.286 align:middle line:84%
It makes a lot of
sense, right, you know--

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Survival
mechanism, absolutely.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:35.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- going to--

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:37.123 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take this

00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:40.459 align:middle line:84%
and so having the slide there
was a really an illustration

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.529 align:middle line:84%
and the main part of it is just
watching how people's brain

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.997 align:middle line:84%
and where they start
getting stalled

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.099 align:middle line:84%
and where their brain
starts getting tired.

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's interesting.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And they get
tired at different times.

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.237 align:middle line:84%
Their brain gets tired
like I don't want

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.505 align:middle line:90%
to really do this green thing.

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:54.707 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to,
you know, do this.

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:55.608 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very interesting.

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:56.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I love it.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:56.942 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:57.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Isn't it fun?

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So give us an idea of
people who we could identify

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.448 align:middle line:84%
with and we might know in the
public eye or famous people

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.316 align:middle line:84%
that are in these
different quadrants.

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, the main
thing is that if you take a look

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.857 align:middle line:84%
at a very creative
person that is sitting

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:15.961 align:middle line:84%
in the yellow quadrant
like Picasso, or da Vinci,

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:19.698 align:middle line:90%
and Einstein, they're very--

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:22.535 align:middle line:84%
Amelia Earhart, they're all
out of the box thinkers.

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:26.438 align:middle line:84%
They're all trained to stay out
of the view and they're playing

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.241 align:middle line:90%
in the place of risk and vision.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Whereas if we
look at people that are

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:36.081 align:middle line:84%
in the interpersonal world that
are interested in connecting

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:40.252 align:middle line:84%
with people and doing things
for the greater good of all,

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.922 align:middle line:84%
then we've got Gandhi,
Martin Luther King,

00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:45.691 align:middle line:90%
Princess Diana, Mother Teresa--

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:49.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can you ever
be-- can you be both?

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:52.398 align:middle line:84%
You can start combining
things and that's when we get

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
into that percentage thing is
that OK, I've got this part

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:84%
of myself that's very creative
and I got this other part

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.071 align:middle line:84%
of myself that's
very interpersonal.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:03.108 align:middle line:84%
So that might be that somebody
that's in costumer service

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:11.183 align:middle line:84%
or that is an actor or a teacher
that does that interpersonal

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.485 align:middle line:84%
and creative and has a lot
of that flexibility going.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK, all right.

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What about
somebody like Obama?

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:20.693 align:middle line:90%
Have you looked at his--

00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:23.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So if we take a
look at some of the things

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.465 align:middle line:84%
that he's led to, here
are some indicators.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:30.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, one, the
biggest thing is, is that, oh,

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:33.205 align:middle line:84%
he really worked as a
community organizer.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:37.009 align:middle line:84%
That's a very interpersonal
red quality.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:40.412 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
connector for the community.

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:43.716 align:middle line:84%
But wait a minute, another part
of myself is this attorney,

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:47.953 align:middle line:84%
which is more towards the blue
analytical thinking part of it.

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.722 align:middle line:84%
Well, another part
of me really wants

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:90%
to cause change to take place.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.193 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a big
part of yellow.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:57.596 align:middle line:84%
I've got to actually try
to do something very,

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.897 align:middle line:90%
you know, big in change.

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle line:84%
But wait a minute, I want
to do that in government.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:01.667 align:middle line:90%
Well, government is guess what?

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.302 align:middle line:90%
Green, it's more structure.

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:04.703 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:05.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So he's got a little
of the red party and a little

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:06.839 align:middle line:90%
of the blue party and-- I mean,

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:84%
he's got a little
of the green party--

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And the idea is
how can you create change,

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.745 align:middle line:90%
that's the yellow quadrant,

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:17.449 align:middle line:84%
into a system that's
more of a green system?

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:20.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's an interesting
question as a leader

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.454 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
appeal to the people

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:25.024 align:middle line:84%
and there are certain
dominant brain types, right?

00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:28.193 align:middle line:84%
So you want to speak to the
green party, you want to speak

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:30.863 align:middle line:84%
to the red party, you want
to speak to the blue party,

00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:31.864 align:middle line:84%
but you're not always
going to be able

00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:32.898 align:middle line:90%
to speak to them all at once.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:33.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:36.468 align:middle line:84%
While you've got to
use your narrative

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:41.573 align:middle line:84%
to put different messages
in four different places.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is that what
you do when you--

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: When I'm
doing a training, yeah.

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- do a
training, is that you speak

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:49.281 align:middle line:84%
to all four different
segments of the brain

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.983 align:middle line:84%
in different parts
of your training?

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.217 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, so
let's do that right now.

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:52.785 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:53.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK, great.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:55.521 align:middle line:90%
Hi, my name is Bill Stierle.

00:20:55.521 --> 00:20:56.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And today,

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:58.691 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn some
facts and information.

00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:00.125 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
really important.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:90%
It could create a really--

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.596 align:middle line:84%
for some of you here that
are listening or going

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.999 align:middle line:84%
to really understand all
the facts and information.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then also, we're
going to learn today a step

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.238 align:middle line:84%
by step way to communicate
in a more effective way.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.007 align:middle line:84%
And for some of you,
you're going

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.344 align:middle line:84%
to really enjoy the connection
between Lisa and for some

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:21.814 align:middle line:84%
of you, it's going to be one of
the most outstanding TV shows

00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:22.881 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever watched.

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:23.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh so what a--

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: I got all four.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- all four of them.

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:28.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I did the blue, and
the green, and then the red,

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.788 align:middle line:90%
connection between you and I.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.757 align:middle line:84%
And then some that's
going to be the one

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:34.226 align:middle line:84%
of the most outstanding TV
shows you've ever watched.

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I liked how
you said that as well.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So here's a
really clear, you know,

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
sign here that shows exactly
what Bill just went through,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.035 align:middle line:90%
the intellectual.

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you say the
entrepreneurial would be

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.339 align:middle line:90%
in the yellow quadrant?

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:51.176 align:middle line:84%
That's very important is
that's where risk takes place.

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:54.913 align:middle line:84%
That's where the creative
idea comes in and then I have

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
to bring that product or
service out to the marketplace.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.986 align:middle line:84%
I've got to build a
team around that then.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.889 align:middle line:84%
So, if I'm going to
take a risk or I'm going

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:05.824 align:middle line:84%
to bring a new product
or service,

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:07.259 align:middle line:90%
I need to bring that in.

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:12.197 align:middle line:84%
So guess what, if we take a
look at technology, Bill Gates,

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Steve Jobs, and Michael Dell

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.535 align:middle line:84%
of Dell Computers
are all yellow first.

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.437 align:middle line:90%
They're all yellow first.

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
They're all take it-- OK,
I want to do something

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.243 align:middle line:84%
in the technology field and
I'm going to do different

00:22:24.243 --> 00:22:25.844 align:middle line:90%
and then their second colors,

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
all their second
colors are different.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So this would be
very interesting to know

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:33.585 align:middle line:84%
when you're selling something
is of course how to sell it to--

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Right.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- different
groups of people and how

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.889 align:middle line:84%
to communicate what
you're selling

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:38.257 align:middle line:90%
to different groups of people.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:41.126 align:middle line:84%
You said that-- I mentioned
earlier that you're a mediator.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So do you
use this in situations

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.865 align:middle line:84%
where there is relationship
conflict, business conflict?

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:50.302 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, absolutely,
mediation, it's very important

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.771 align:middle line:84%
to know what the
person's thinking style is

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.974 align:middle line:90%
because it allows us to be--

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.876 align:middle line:90%
it gives us a snapshot

00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:02.014 align:middle line:84%
to understand what their
primary needs are and what--

00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:06.652 align:middle line:84%
the way they would like to hear
a language narrative to be put

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:10.055 align:middle line:90%
in a way so they can hear it.

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:10.823 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:10.823 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's important.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So earlier, I mentioned about
needs being met in a way

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to be
heard, to really be heard.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.333 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm speaking in an
intellectual way to someone

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:84%
who is a feeler, they're
not going to hear me, right?

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:26.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah, they're not.

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:27.172 align:middle line:90%
How about this?

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.741 align:middle line:84%
How about-- this
is really funny.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.544 align:middle line:84%
If you take the word "plan",
just the word "plan"--

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:33.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:36.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and you
ask people to define plan,

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:41.987 align:middle line:84%
just plan, there are four
different definitions you

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:42.754 align:middle line:90%
can use.

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I am sure, yeah.

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:47.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, so blue is
going to be financial plan.

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK?

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:50.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm not a blue,
all right I get that.

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Right, great.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.332 align:middle line:84%
Yellow is going to
be a strategic plan,

00:23:53.332 --> 00:23:55.067 align:middle line:90%
three to five years out.

00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:56.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Green is going
to be a tactical plan.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to do in
the next day, week, month?

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.408 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To get there, OK.

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:06.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then the red
is going to be a people plan.

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:08.614 align:middle line:90%
Who is going to do this?

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Who do we need to onboard
in order to do this?

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:14.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So it's
very interesting.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a simple
word, right?

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But are you starting
to understand who you are?

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're being
able to identify?

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:21.393 align:middle line:90%
This is so great too.

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So do the different
quadrants ask questions

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:26.999 align:middle line:90%
in a different way?

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:27.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: They do.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The slide depicts--

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually-- this
is-- I really like this slide

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.874 align:middle line:84%
and this piece of information
'cause it's called the quickest

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
way to understand
who you're talking

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.415 align:middle line:84%
to because they'll actually
build their narrative based

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:47.019 align:middle line:84%
on why questions,
or what questions--

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:49.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- or who
questions, or how questions.

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:53.792 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody says how are we--
as soon as they start there,

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:57.429 align:middle line:84%
the next response is,
well first, we need to.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:58.497 align:middle line:90%
Second, we need to.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:00.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Third, we-- 'cause
they asked the how question.

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Great, OK.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Who is going
to be at the party.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Well hear the names
up, see that's going

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.141 align:middle line:90%
to be the natural flow.

00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK, OK.

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Why,
well, the why is

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.847 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
painting a big picture.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, that
makes-- and what about--

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:18.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- these facts.

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- is now the what and
the what if, what if people do,

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.821 align:middle line:84%
do you know what if, what
if, what if, what if,

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:23.922 align:middle line:90%
this happens, what if.

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:28.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: What is
a blue, if is yellow.

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So how do you
appeal into the what ifs.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well, what if--

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:33.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: This happens.

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- I'm
taking this data

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.437 align:middle line:84%
and I'm bringing it
and revisioning it.

00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:39.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:39.805 --> 00:25:41.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I want to have a
revision of this data, what if.

00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:42.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's a
what if question.

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
a what if question.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:44.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:45.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Now.

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:48.413 align:middle line:84%
So now we understand the
different ways to communicate

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:50.682 align:middle line:84%
to someone you could
identify their personality,

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:52.751 align:middle line:84%
their brain dominance
type instantly by the way

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:90%
that they ask questions.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK, great.

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
this a little bit.

00:25:58.824 --> 00:25:59.658 align:middle line:90%
This--

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:00.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: I love this slide.

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Great.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, what does the slide mean?

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: This
is a great slide.

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:04.463 align:middle line:84%
This is when our
brain shuts off.

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:09.301 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is going to pull a
stop light or go to red light

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:13.672 align:middle line:84%
when we're at the one
that's the worst for us.

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:15.674 align:middle line:84%
If we're not good at
one of these things,

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.976 align:middle line:84%
our brain will start
shutting down.

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:21.713 align:middle line:84%
For all the folks that are on
the red and the yellow side

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:24.316 align:middle line:84%
of side of the fence,
chances of them waiting

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:28.453 align:middle line:84%
for their taxes on,
you know, the 15th--

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:29.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: The day
they're due, yeah.

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:31.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That
they're due is very--

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:34.993 align:middle line:84%
is high because they're putting
it off 'cause their brain is

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
already in a stop light
mode towards that value set

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.966 align:middle line:84%
which is more the
blue-green side of the fence.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:45.537 align:middle line:84%
Those folks have finished it
already some time, you know, in,

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:48.573 align:middle line:84%
you know, January,
February, you know, done.

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:49.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How do you
balance that out

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:53.645 align:middle line:84%
if you are the thinker
feeler, I mean, the feeler,

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:84%
the emotional feeler, how
do you comply with rules

00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:01.586 align:middle line:84%
and organizations
and directions.

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:04.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, the challenge
is, is that first off to move

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
into the mindset that there
is not a good or bad way--

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- of thinking.

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There's not a right or
a wrong way of thinking

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to back off judgment
based on thinking.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.103 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
not a better thinker

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because a person
doesn't know math

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.809 align:middle line:84%
and they're a brilliant
artist is

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:26.211 align:middle line:84%
because they are
brilliant artist.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because
that's what they are.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's what they are.

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:30.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's what
they're meant to do.

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:33.351 align:middle line:84%
Some people can network
the heck out of a room.

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:34.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:37.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And they could have
100 of their closest friends.

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:39.357 align:middle line:84%
Where some people have four
throughout their whole life--

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:40.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:40.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- and that's it.

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:42.327 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: There's
no right or wrong,

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it's just two different
ways to do that.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Quite often we look at
other people and we expect them

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to be the same as we are.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.403 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're teaching
here and what you've taught for

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.105 align:middle line:84%
years is to just respect
where they are

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:54.573 align:middle line:84%
and not take it personal
as you said.

00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:56.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
right, it's a preference.

00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:57.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Preference.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:58.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And get used to--
and what I try to get people

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:02.314 align:middle line:84%
to do is get used
to a super power,

00:28:02.314 --> 00:28:07.152 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want Iron
Man to do Hulk's job.

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.287 align:middle line:90%
Iron Man is a--

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:10.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:12.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- yellow,
blue character.

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:14.459 align:middle line:90%
Hulk is a--

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Emotional.

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- red and green
character, with anger issues.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:19.865 align:middle line:90%
OK, so.

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Anger management,
that's not on this model.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know I can--
I could do all the superheroes

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:25.871 align:middle line:84%
if you like, it's a very
funny stuff, you know, Batman,

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.239 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
his thinking style.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:29.441 align:middle line:84%
Sure, each one of them have
the different thinking style.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:33.111 align:middle line:84%
So, why, because those
different characters saying

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.247 align:middle line:84%
with the X-men, I mean, they're
are all these different--

00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:37.849 align:middle line:84%
there-- why, because
I like this character.

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:40.185 align:middle line:84%
I dress up as this
character because I'm

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:43.989 align:middle line:84%
like the Spider-Man character,
I'm like the Superman character.

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:45.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They're
archetypes, essentially.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: They're
essentially archetypes

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:90%
or our modern archetypes.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.263 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what's very, very
interesting about this detail is

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:84%
that we know Superman
has kryptonite.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:55.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well guess what,
all of us have kryptonite.

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:56.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We all have
our shadow side.

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: We all
have our side.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So the idea then is, is that if
we have a shadow that's going

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.812 align:middle line:84%
on, is that either
we delegate it.

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:07.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:08.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: You know?

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So the CFO
shouldn't be doing HR.

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's correct,
that's another strong play

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:13.819 align:middle line:90%
because they're actually good.

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:17.455 align:middle line:84%
So in-- if we take a
look at this next slide,

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.659 align:middle line:84%
the CFO is going to be
more in the blue place.

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:23.395 align:middle line:84%
The COO, the operations
person is going

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:26.731 align:middle line:84%
to be more green is going
to implement things.

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:27.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The VP
of HR is going

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.702 align:middle line:84%
to handle the interpersonal
issues,

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
the VP of marketing is going to
handle the expense and trying

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
to get the message out to people

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and try various different
messages and then measure them,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.615 align:middle line:90%
hear the different messages.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:45.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, what if you're
a one-man show and you have

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:47.152 align:middle line:90%
to communicate to the employee.

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.187 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're all of it.

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:50.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:53.458 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
start out and they--

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.528 align:middle line:84%
they're going to put on
those several different hats.

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:29:57.863 --> 00:29:59.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And that's good
when you're getting started

00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:04.035 align:middle line:84%
because you're trying
to get the thing moving.

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:04.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But--

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Right.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's another
part of that.

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: But the but part
is, is that they're going to run

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.442 align:middle line:90%
into their kryptonite.

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:13.378 align:middle line:84%
They're going to run into the
thing that they don't do well

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:15.814 align:middle line:84%
and they need to
trust and delegate it.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So there's
a solution there

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.385 align:middle line:84%
which will be delegating
your weakness.

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:24.823 align:middle line:84%
And here's the fun part
of that in some of us--

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.225 align:middle line:90%
many of us, like 83 percent

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:30.028 align:middle line:84%
of first marriages
are opposite dominance.

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:32.397 align:middle line:84%
We marry the person
that's opposite us.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:33.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why?

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because
they're our kryptonite.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.101 align:middle line:84%
We figure they can handle
it,

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.403 align:middle line:84%
we'll just push it across to
them,

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:41.373 align:middle line:84%
and they're mysterious for six
months, for the first six months

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:42.574 align:middle line:90%
which is completely magical.

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.042 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Wow,
look at this person.

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:45.143 align:middle line:90%
They could do all that stuff."

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:46.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I can't do--

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- there's
this little space in there

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.848 align:middle line:84%
that we can connect a little
bit, but I don't know.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.484 align:middle line:84%
There's this magical
thing that's turned up.

00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:56.454 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very opposite of us
and you know, it's attractive.

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:57.222 align:middle line:90%
It's, you know--

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So are you saying

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.427 align:middle line:84%
to marry your similar
brain type?

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:03.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: No.

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:06.564 align:middle line:84%
The attraction pieces that
were attracted to the opposite.

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:10.268 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is that
people don't know that.

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And they don't
know that a part of the rule is

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.573 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate the differences.

00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:17.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Ah, there's the
key-- relationship key.

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:19.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Right.

00:31:19.311 --> 00:31:21.813 align:middle line:84%
How can I appreciate that
you're doing something I hate.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:22.747 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:23.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But I don't
understand--

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and
I don't understand.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- possibly managed.

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And it's
better not for me to not

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to judge the way
you're doing it.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Good idea.

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And think
that I know a better way.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.058 align:middle line:84%
I just let you do that
over there and like--

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.759 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll meet
in the middle somewhere.

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Great idea.

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:36.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And you'll
handle that space over here

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and I'm handling this space.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well, that's a great,

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:41.633 align:middle line:84%
great piece of relationship
advice.

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:42.467 align:middle line:90%
That's our show folks.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:43.601 align:middle line:90%
That's over.

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all we need to
hear.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.538 align:middle line:90%
The key to life by Bill Stierle.

00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It seemed
I'm kidding.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.143 align:middle line:84%
And it's celebrating, how can I
celebrate what the other person

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:53.545 align:middle line:90%
is bringing to the table?

00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:56.147 align:middle line:84%
How can I celebrate that they're
bringing something different?

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:58.717 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm very clear I
always say in my lifetime,

00:31:58.717 --> 00:32:00.118 align:middle line:90%
I will never be an accountant.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:02.654 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, I am
actually OK with that.

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:03.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm really OK with that.

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:04.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:05.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I get to
be an organizational

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:06.524 align:middle line:90%
development consultant.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:08.059 align:middle line:90%
I get to be a mediator.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I get to be a
communication specialist,

00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:11.563 align:middle line:90%
that's what I get to do

00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:84%
and that's my contribution
and my piece.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:14.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And I could see how

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that would be extremely
effective.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.634 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:17.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's a good
thing to stay in my--

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:20.939 align:middle line:84%
inside my super power
and not really in--

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:90%
what do I do with my kryptonite?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.909 align:middle line:84%
I ask people to help
me with that

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.644 align:middle line:90%
and I delegate those things.

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:29.848 align:middle line:84%
I say could you please work on
my scheduling here, Jennifer?

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:30.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: You know, Frankie,

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.752 align:middle line:84%
can you handle the
bookkeeping over here.

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
My financial manager
does his thing.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.788 align:middle line:90%
Steve does his thing.

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.057 align:middle line:84%
And each one of those different
people are taking different

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:43.728 align:middle line:84%
pieces of the things that I
am not really very good at.

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:46.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So in a leadership
context in this next slide,

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:50.001 align:middle line:84%
how do we know what these
people's kryptonite is

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.504 align:middle line:84%
and how they manage
their kryptonite?

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:54.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Some of them
actually have done a pretty good

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:57.042 align:middle line:84%
job of managing their
kryptonite.

00:32:57.042 --> 00:33:00.712 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I even think of
something like Richard Branson

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:03.481 align:middle line:84%
that sits up in yellow that
manages and then and thinks

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.651 align:middle line:84%
about many-- multiple
different companies

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.253 align:middle line:84%
that he's running
simultaneously,

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:09.654 align:middle line:90%
how do you do that?

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:13.124 align:middle line:84%
From a yellow place, you have
key individuals that you trust

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.693 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have to extend
that pesky trust thing.

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:19.731 align:middle line:84%
And then you navigate your
brand and brand imagery.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:23.334 align:middle line:84%
And then you say one day,
yeah, you know, I'm stuck here,

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:26.337 align:middle line:84%
you know, in an island here
and I want to start an airline

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:29.307 align:middle line:84%
because it's clear that these
islands are underserviced

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:31.709 align:middle line:84%
and I think I could start
an airline out of nothing.

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: I mean-- I--

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.581 align:middle line:84%
you know, how do you start
an airline out of nothing?

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:37.715 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the way you start.

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.651 align:middle line:84%
You start an airline,
now you call your people

00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:40.752 align:middle line:90%
and say listen, this is--

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:41.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm going
to start an airline.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- start
an airline, yeah,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.589 align:middle line:90%
start an airline, ended up at--

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, that
is actually a lot

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.493 align:middle line:84%
of these people have become
very popular leaders--

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:49.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:33:49.928 --> 00:33:54.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- because they do know
how to find people they trust

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:57.335 align:middle line:90%
to handle their weaknesses.

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them have
had situational consequences

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:90%
because of their thinking style.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Oprah has had her challenges
with her thinking style.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:10.982 align:middle line:84%
Mary Kay, Martha Stewart
most certainly extended trust

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.617 align:middle line:84%
to somebody that was
having yellow and got her

00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:14.985 align:middle line:90%
into a bunch of trouble there.

00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:18.188 align:middle line:84%
And each one of those folks have
had situational consequences

00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:20.992 align:middle line:84%
where they're not seeing what's
going on in the other side.

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:23.927 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they've also
stayed in their super power

00:34:23.927 --> 00:34:27.499 align:middle line:84%
and have had to make
changes, you know,

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:29.634 align:middle line:84%
'cause they didn't see what
was actually taking place

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't really
didn't even see the risk

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.238 align:middle line:90%
that was taking place.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what a
situational consequence is, OK.

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:36.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:84%
That's what a situational
consequence is.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:40.078 align:middle line:84%
You know, and that's
where the power to--

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:46.151 align:middle line:84%
it's how do I appreciate
the way my thinking works

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.253 align:middle line:84%
and then contribute
that to the world?

00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:51.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to contribute
what my strength is.

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:34:52.624 --> 00:34:54.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then I'll move
into a place of acceptance.

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:56.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that's the key.

00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:58.062 align:middle line:84%
It's not judgment,
but acceptance.

00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:01.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I'm on acceptance
that I'm probably not going

00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:03.835 align:middle line:84%
to know at all and that's
not the objective anyways.

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.103 align:middle line:90%
It's not to know at all.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.939 align:middle line:84%
The objective is, is that
how can I stay on the path

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:10.375 align:middle line:90%
of my own progress and skill

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:13.178 align:middle line:84%
and mastery inside
my thinking skills.

00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:15.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: 'Cause that's going to
be what you're better at anyway.

00:35:15.013 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.314 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:19.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, so the
idea is, is that to break

00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:23.388 align:middle line:84%
down the walls between these
four different thinking styles

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:26.291 align:middle line:84%
and to see that it's
a collaborative

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.059 align:middle line:90%
and cooperative process.

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.727 align:middle line:90%
So break down the walls.

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:30.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:31.262 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:34.098 align:middle line:90%
We want to see that, Lisa,

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:37.135 align:middle line:84%
we want to really
just engage process

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:39.938 align:middle line:84%
that there's somebody
else that knows something

00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:43.041 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know from a
different point of view.

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:47.745 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to allow
a broader view of truth

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.948 align:middle line:84%
to take place, not
a limited truth.

00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:51.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It seems like something

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.284 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
antidote to selfishness.

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:84%
This is very anti-selfish
process.

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:56.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.189 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to move

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:84%
into a collaborative
cooperative strategy rather

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.997 align:middle line:90%
than a competitive or you know,

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that adversarial style
strategy you did.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.172 align:middle line:84%
The strategy of not enough,
the strategy of and/or and move

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.506 align:middle line:90%
out of black and white thinking.

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What if you have
somebody in your workspace

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:23.715 align:middle line:84%
that isn't that competitive
dog eat dog mindset?

00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:26.184 align:middle line:84%
Do you bring this concept
in and get eaten alive

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:28.653 align:middle line:84%
or how would you-- what
brain dominant model would

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.054 align:middle line:90%
that person be in?

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, that's where
it gets interesting 'cause a lot

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.425 align:middle line:84%
of the things when I come
in I do a team analysis.

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:36.327 align:middle line:84%
I know where everybody
sits all the time.

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:37.795 align:middle line:84%
I know where they're
sitting and I teach them

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:38.896 align:middle line:90%
where they're sitting.

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.098 align:middle line:84%
Just like listen,
they're having--

00:36:40.098 --> 00:36:41.499 align:middle line:84%
they're holding this
part of the business.

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.368 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can challenge them

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:46.271 align:middle line:84%
or their supervisor can
challenge them on their skill

00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and mastery and you
could challenge them

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.109 align:middle line:84%
on their professional
development.

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:53.411 align:middle line:84%
You know, rather than
thinking that you're going

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:90%
to like turn them over.

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:55.947 align:middle line:84%
You're going to try
something new.

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So don't change
their personality just look

00:36:57.749 --> 00:36:58.616 align:middle line:90%
at where they're sitting.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:36:59.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:00.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:02.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And even take
things, I've actually--

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:04.055 align:middle line:90%
and company realignments.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:07.959 align:middle line:84%
I'll take things off of people's
performance evaluation says this

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.694 align:middle line:84%
does not belong on this
performance evaluation.

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.229 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't belong there.

00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:14.732 align:middle line:84%
It belongs on this other
person's 'cause you're setting

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:18.236 align:middle line:84%
that person up to what
they're not good at.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So if you put
organizational skills

00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:22.173 align:middle line:84%
in an artist's performance
analysis,

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:23.741 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to get a good--

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: No, you know--

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:25.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- performance.

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:25.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:26.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:27.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
A there's some ways to
do it and so we're trying

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.281 align:middle line:84%
to really engage
the flow of things.

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like this
picture and this image

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.586 align:middle line:84%
so much is that I want to flow
these different energies to show

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:39.958 align:middle line:84%
up and I want to be mindful
of all of them and to be able

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:43.227 align:middle line:84%
to nurture each one of those
four different value sets

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:84%
and then to infuse us into
an organization or a marriage

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:84%
or in my communication
with my kids.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:51.569 align:middle line:90%
That's a very important part.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:54.372 align:middle line:84%
So this is a huge piece
and a lot of what you teach

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:58.109 align:middle line:84%
and what I've-- was introduced
to about was parenting,

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:03.014 align:middle line:84%
is how do you use this-- now can
your child be a different brain

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.482 align:middle line:90%
dominance than you are?

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How?

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:07.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It's so wacky.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.022 align:middle line:84%
So for example, my
son, Aiden, he's 12

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.624 align:middle line:84%
and he is yellow
first, blue second.

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:16.461 align:middle line:84%
He's got like killer math
skills, I mean he really does.

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:18.129 align:middle line:90%
It's like a little wacky.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.798 align:middle line:84%
So my blue color
card is my last.

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:22.233 align:middle line:90%
It's clearly my kryptonite.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So what happens
is, is that I sit down with him

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:27.939 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Listen, here's
a shorter way to do it,

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:29.540 align:middle line:84%
it goes like that,"
you know and you can--

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.576 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:33.678 align:middle line:84%
And I go like, "What do you
mean I get up here," I go,

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:34.846 align:middle line:90%
"It's like, well, you know, OK.

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You just teach me
how you do it."

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.949 align:middle line:84%
He goes, "Well, this is
the way I work on it,

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:38.983 align:middle line:90%
I would never do that."

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:40.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: 'Cause
my yellow thinking--

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.387 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for shortcut
all the way.

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:44.055 align:middle line:84%
He's going to like, "I'm
not doing shortcut."

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.491 align:middle line:84%
Here's the analytical
and here's the--

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:47.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Now--

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:49.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now, here's
when it gets really cool.

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:54.766 align:middle line:84%
So I go over-- I review these
cards with my kids and we'd go

00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:58.269 align:middle line:84%
over them, you know, when
certain situations come out.

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And so, like after
Aiden was a weekend at school,

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.508 align:middle line:84%
I go, "OK, and let's
assess your teachers."

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:06.577 align:middle line:84%
He goes, "Well, here-- my
teacher, this teacher does this,

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.212 align:middle line:90%
and this teacher does this."

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.447 align:middle line:90%
I go, "Well, what do you think?"

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.049 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, "Well, I think
this teacher does this."

00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.785 align:middle line:84%
I go, "Well, when are you
going to break it to her."

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.086 align:middle line:84%
"Well, I think I'll
go in tomorrow."

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I go, "Do you want
the color cards?"

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.488 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah, I'll take
the color cards."

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.023 align:middle line:90%
He takes the color cards.

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.425 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, here's where
we're going to struggle

00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:23.227 align:middle line:84%
between teachers and students
and he's teaching the teacher

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:25.763 align:middle line:84%
how they're going to
struggle because you know,

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:28.199 align:middle line:90%
you do this kind of yellow thing

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.935 align:middle line:84%
and then you've got
this green thing you do

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.637 align:middle line:84%
and then you got
this blue thing.

00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:34.272 align:middle line:84%
We're going to connect
here and here,

00:39:34.272 --> 00:39:35.973 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going
to connect over here.

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:38.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And she's now like,
what are you talking about.

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:39.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what does that tell
you?

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.446 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to be
able to be a student

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:45.249 align:middle line:84%
to get a good grade based on
your teachers or learning--

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.385 align:middle line:84%
our daughter is a
very creative writer

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:50.455 align:middle line:84%
and her writing teacher
is very analytical

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.491 align:middle line:84%
so she's getting these
bad grades on something--

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:54.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's creative
writing.

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So she should go
up to the teacher and say,

00:39:56.928 --> 00:39:58.096 align:middle line:84%
"Your style of thinking
is different

00:39:58.096 --> 00:39:59.063 align:middle line:90%
than my style of thinking.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.098 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're giving me bad
grades."

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:01.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And I'm just
looking for the bridge

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:02.633 align:middle line:90%
between the two of us.

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:05.403 align:middle line:84%
Now schools-- school
regrettably tilt left,

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.739 align:middle line:84%
multiple choice test
favor blue thinkers.

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:11.275 align:middle line:84%
Now this is-- there's
a situation consequence

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.677 align:middle line:90%
for both thinkers.

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the red and yellow
folks think there's something

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.248 align:middle line:84%
wrong with them, that
was the way I grew up.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.749 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong
with me, I'm on the red

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.650 align:middle line:90%
and yellow side of the fence.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Something
wrong with me

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:24.856 align:middle line:84%
because clearly my friends
did really good test scores

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.525 align:middle line:84%
and they know what the teacher
does and they know what I do

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:30.461 align:middle line:84%
and the teacher-- I had no
idea that-- no, no-- they--

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:32.563 align:middle line:84%
everything was skewed
in their directions.

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wouldn't it be great
if they could have the SAT

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.767 align:middle line:84%
in the different color
cards and you can say,

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.936 align:middle line:90%
here's your artistic thinker SAT

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:40.872 align:middle line:84%
and here's your analytical
thinker SAT

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and they could have
advanced calculus.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:45.376 align:middle line:84%
'Cause that's the
way it needs to go.

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:49.146 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it needs to go
and there's several countries

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:53.718 align:middle line:84%
that are moving into dropping a
lot of the standardized testing

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:56.654 align:middle line:84%
and going a collaborative
testing where we're going

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.656 align:middle line:90%
to test you on projects.

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:03.895 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be a team of
six and everybody's got to go--

00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:06.664 align:middle line:84%
get over the bar of these six
people in the pot.

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.399 align:middle line:84%
And here's your project
and every week,

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.067 align:middle line:90%
you got to execute this project.

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.702 align:middle line:84%
Now there's going to be a
little bit of math, and a little

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.739 align:middle line:84%
of history, a little bit of
English but everybody's got

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:16.574 align:middle line:90%
to get over the bar on this.

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:17.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:18.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And then why?

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:20.111 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what that--

00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:22.513 align:middle line:84%
what it turns out is
you have an 18-year-old

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:24.682 align:middle line:90%
that can work well with others.

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:90%
You can have somebody that can--

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.287 align:middle line:84%
has dealt with conflict
along the way.

00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:32.056 align:middle line:84%
Not all to be suddenly thrown
out here and because the--

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:34.091 align:middle line:84%
here's a situational
consequence.

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The blue and the
green thinkers think

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.663 align:middle line:84%
that because they have
gotten the As and the Bs

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:84%
out of the group, they felt that
they're-- that they know things.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.337 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I got a whole
group of those folks that are,

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:50.107 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're working for
me and they don't know that,

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:52.543 align:middle line:84%
you know, like-- well, 'cause I
figured out what they're doing

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.312 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just putting
things in front of them.

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And they think,
oh, yeah, that's 'cause I know.

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's-- I mean, that's
experiential learning and then--

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It is.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:00.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- I think it's
the best way of learning.

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's got to be
90 percent of retention is

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.722 align:middle line:84%
and experiential and
project work, yeah.

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Definitely.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's going to
be done in project works.

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:07.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What was Einstein?

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Einstein
code is great.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.661 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. The code--

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:12.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: He was a blue, right?

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yellow first.

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yellow first.

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:15.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yellow first.

00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:15.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That makes
sense, visionary.

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Why?

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.301 align:middle line:90%
Visionary first.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because if somebody
goes to sleep

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and imagines himself riding
across a lightning bolt

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.377 align:middle line:84%
through the universe and
then wakes up the next day

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:29.413 align:middle line:84%
and brings whatever works
about mathematically,

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:33.351 align:middle line:84%
that's yellow first and
then, you know, blue second.

00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:35.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, this quote
from him really just--

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:37.855 align:middle line:84%
it just described
the whole idea here.

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:40.725 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is a genius but if
you judge a fish by its ability

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:43.828 align:middle line:84%
to climb a tree, it will
live its whole life believing

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:45.029 align:middle line:90%
that it is stupid.

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.297 align:middle line:84%
That's what you were just
talking about in terms

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.366 align:middle line:90%
of the education level.

00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:49.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
right, that's right.

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:51.669 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big damage to--

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:55.006 align:middle line:84%
on both sides because
if somebody's good

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:57.642 align:middle line:84%
at multiple choice test,
they have a false sense

00:42:57.642 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:90%
that they know things.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:03.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So that the
person that knows facts

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:06.484 align:middle line:84%
and information, the
instructional system--

00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
the instructional system is
very simple, very simple.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.356 align:middle line:84%
It's very-- It's going to be
broken down into one sentence.

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:15.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Get the right answer
in the shortest amount of time.

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's the system.

00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:17.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:18.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now,
here's the difference

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.464 align:middle line:84%
between instruction
and education.

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:25.936 align:middle line:84%
Two Latin words, instruktori
which means two pack in.

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:30.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Edukari
which means two lead out.

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.543 align:middle line:84%
You don't have an
education system.

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.178 align:middle line:90%
It's an instructional system.

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We do because
you ask a child

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.884 align:middle line:84%
to repeat what they learned
the grade before and-- yeah.

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:43.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now, we
got to do a better job

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:47.958 align:middle line:84%
of accessing mentorship, at
putting people in alignment

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:51.829 align:middle line:84%
with the person in that skill
set, but that seems super power.

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And we want to train
the person in their super power.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.602 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to think
that everybody is going

00:43:58.602 --> 00:44:00.204 align:middle line:90%
to do math the same way.

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:01.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, like
this particular student.

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:03.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Oh my gosh,
this is a great one.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.776 align:middle line:84%
When-- All of a sudden,
they're taking the word

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.344 align:middle line:90%
and they're using a definition.

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.447 align:middle line:90%
The definition is expand.

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:10.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:13.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, in mathematics
it means a certain thing.

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:17.488 align:middle line:84%
Visually though, if I'm talking
to look at a yellow answer,

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:19.256 align:middle line:84%
I would give a hundred
percent for this.

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:20.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: For this particular--

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Answer.

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:22.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- answer of expanding.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:23.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The teacher
goes, "Very funny,

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:27.331 align:middle line:84%
Peter" and gives an X. That's
the devaluing yellow way

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.032 align:middle line:90%
to think.

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:30.101 align:middle line:90%
I'd at least give half.

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:84%
At least give half
for the yellow part

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:33.504 align:middle line:90%
of it, at least half.

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I know, so
when this one is.

00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:39.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Find X. Here it is.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a yellow answer.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.282 align:middle line:90%
It's correct.

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:46.784 align:middle line:90%
That is a correct answer.

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:49.353 align:middle line:90%
Here it is, finding something.

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That is
a yellow answer.

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That
is a yellow answer.

00:44:51.756 --> 00:44:54.125 align:middle line:90%
It's not correct mathematically.

00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:55.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But it's true.

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:56.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It's true.

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:59.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It would be
considered sarcastic.

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.664 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:03.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, this next slide
is very valuable for us, Lisa,

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.804 align:middle line:84%
it's because when the
brain starts shutting down,

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:13.911 align:middle line:84%
when we get to the point
when we're being forced

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:19.617 align:middle line:84%
into a preference set
that is not like ours,

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:24.121 align:middle line:90%
then these models will retreat,

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:30.094 align:middle line:84%
these different thinking styles
will retreat and do a strategy

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:32.763 align:middle line:90%
of getting distance from.

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:36.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I say yes and that's
what we see in education system,

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:39.503 align:middle line:84%
where we'll see in an employee
relationship that doesn't work.

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:43.207 align:middle line:84%
We see this in relationships in
parenting, in different ways.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:46.677 align:middle line:84%
So that it actually makes the
other person contract even more

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.479 align:middle line:90%
and feel that they're wrong.

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:51.382 align:middle line:84%
So criticism is going
to come from blue.

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:53.617 align:middle line:90%
It's criticism on a fact--

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:54.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- or a
piece of information.

00:45:56.687 --> 00:46:00.658 align:middle line:84%
They're going to pick a slice
of truth and politically,

00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:02.593 align:middle line:84%
we've got big problems
with this 'cause I'm going

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.362 align:middle line:84%
to pick a small piece of
truth and I'm going to hammer

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:09.667 align:middle line:84%
that message so that becomes
the standard of truth.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:12.736 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'm ignoring
all the rest of this truth.

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:16.941 align:middle line:84%
This is the truth, even if
it's financially flawed,

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.576 align:middle line:84%
they will pick it
and they'll run it.

00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:19.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yup.

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's called
controlling a narrative.

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:26.817 align:middle line:84%
OK? Defensiveness, defensiveness
is "I didn't do it,

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:29.854 align:middle line:90%
it's not me, that's not true."

00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:32.056 align:middle line:90%
See all it's defensive talk.

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:35.759 align:middle line:84%
Contempt, "You don't
really love me,

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:39.663 align:middle line:84%
you don't really respect the
relationship, you don't care,

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.832 align:middle line:84%
you're really not
considering people."

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:42.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's in relationship.

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:43.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
in relationship.

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:45.402 align:middle line:90%
All that's read contempt.

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:48.472 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could pull a little
more contempt into a little bit.

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:51.876 align:middle line:84%
Withdrawal is going to
be more, "Whatever."

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: "I'm out of here."

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.846 align:middle line:90%
Shut down or stonewalling.

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do the-- I mean,
do the yellow people tend

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.650 align:middle line:90%
to do those types of withdrawal.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
correct, that's correct.

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:02.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.388 align:middle line:90%
So if you have a child who tends

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.824 align:middle line:84%
to be the yellow
visionary thinker--

00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: They'll start
talking-- they'll stop talking.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:09.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Their shadow side

00:47:09.527 --> 00:47:12.296 align:middle line:84%
or their contempt is
going to be the-- I see--

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:16.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because you are
not seeing what I am seeing.

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:18.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So when you start to
see that child withdrawing,

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.638 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
you're not appealing

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:22.806 align:middle line:84%
to their communication
style and to get more

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:25.776 align:middle line:84%
into the visionary conversation,
we draw them back out.

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:26.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:47:26.477 --> 00:47:27.745 align:middle line:90%
That's the best part.

00:47:27.745 --> 00:47:31.282 align:middle line:84%
If I want to speak to the
overview, my younger son,

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:37.321 align:middle line:84%
Tristan is seven and he has a
strong red-yellow power to him

00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:40.624 align:middle line:84%
and this yellow thing he does
when he goes into stonewalling

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:42.693 align:middle line:90%
and withdrawal, it's really--

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.562 align:middle line:84%
it's tough because all of a
sudden, he goes like this.

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:46.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I'm sure.

00:47:46.497 --> 00:47:47.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Why is
he doing that?

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:51.135 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me a very
important message here.

00:47:51.135 --> 00:47:55.272 align:middle line:84%
You're using a lot of words and
you're not considering my choice

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:58.809 align:middle line:84%
and you're not fully
understanding me and my words.

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough words

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.746 align:middle line:84%
to fight back you--
with you big person.

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:05.716 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to shut
down here for a little while

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.884 align:middle line:90%
and I need some space.

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.086 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
usually says, next, I see,

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.955 align:middle line:84%
boy when I see your
fingers in your ears,

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:12.923 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like you don't
want to hear my words

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.292 align:middle line:84%
and you want some time to
think about this and calm down.

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you would like?

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:90%
He does this.

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:20.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then
he gets his space.

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, let me
give you five or 10 minutes

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:25.302 align:middle line:84%
and I'll come back and we'll
see how that works, OK.

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:90%
He goes, OK.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then in
five to 10 minutes,

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.774 align:middle line:90%
it's different ball game.

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: But at least
it's not a 20-minute fight.

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:35.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And it's also
not something I have to pay

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:38.682 align:middle line:84%
for later when I ask
him to brush his teeth.

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:39.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And ah--

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:41.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Or go to bed
'cause otherwise I'll have

00:48:41.352 --> 00:48:42.386 align:middle line:90%
to pay for it later.

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:43.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Good point.

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.055 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is-- OK.

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:47.591 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
the rule of thumb here.

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.426 align:middle line:84%
Your beliefs speak
on your thoughts.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.861 align:middle line:90%
This is a great quote.

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.964 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts become your words,
your words become your actions,

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:57.267 align:middle line:84%
your actions become your habits,
your habits become your values,

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.602 align:middle line:90%
your values become your destiny.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.372 align:middle line:90%
That is beautifully stated.

00:49:01.372 --> 00:49:02.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I really
enjoyed this quote

00:49:02.473 --> 00:49:04.808 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest thing
here is that we got

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:10.414 align:middle line:84%
to really watch the beliefs
that we've been handed down.

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We really want to do a
better job at poking a stick

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.786 align:middle line:84%
at those things and
really test them out to see

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.154 align:middle line:90%
if it's a working bull thing

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:84%
or is this something
I need to reframe?

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:25.763 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to pull back
my labels and my diagnoses.

00:49:25.763 --> 00:49:27.498 align:middle line:90%
I want to do those as much.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:29.566 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what is really alive

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.268 align:middle line:90%
in this other person here.

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:35.239 align:middle line:84%
What's at the heart of the
message that they're bringing?

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:36.373 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what the heart

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.409 align:middle line:84%
of the message of
my son doing this.

00:49:38.409 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, I want
to really find out when--

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:43.414 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
really valuable there.

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:44.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.683 align:middle line:84%
So this next slide looks
like a study that was done.

00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Is this a study?

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:47.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:50.988 align:middle line:84%
A very important
slide to talk about is

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that how the brain works in
reference to try to cause change

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and very simply speaking
is that if we take a look

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.666 align:middle line:84%
at the front part of our
brain and we take a look

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:06.637 align:middle line:84%
at the logical part over
here and the spatial part

00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
or the future thinking, so we
have logic and future thinking,

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.611 align:middle line:84%
the blue and the yellow
part of the brain.

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:15.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: This
part of our brain has

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.715 align:middle line:90%
about 400,000 connections--

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:19.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:21.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- per micron
of neuroconnections.

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:23.954 align:middle line:84%
It's the newer part
of our brain.

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:27.758 align:middle line:84%
But that part of our brain is
the older part of our brain.

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:32.529 align:middle line:84%
It's the emotional part over
here, the amygdala, lower right,

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:37.668 align:middle line:84%
the red part and the green part
of our brain, long-term memory,

00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:84%
hippocampus, all
these-- this is the--

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:46.076 align:middle line:84%
this part of the brain has
4.3 million connections,

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:53.250 align:middle line:84%
400,000 versus 4.3
million, therefore, emotion

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:59.857 align:middle line:84%
and long-term memory always wins
over logic and future thinking.

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:00.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So they're dominant.

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:05.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The reason why is
because the brain is building

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.132 align:middle line:90%
in safekeeping things.

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:13.403 align:middle line:84%
It wants to remember what a
spider is and a snake is--

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Survival.

00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:15.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- through
generation

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:19.243 align:middle line:90%
and put an emotion to it.

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:22.312 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, no matter
what your logical mind

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:26.817 align:middle line:84%
or your spatial mind says,
if I said, "Hey Lisa,

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.719 align:middle line:84%
there's a black widow
spider crawling."

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I am running
out that door.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:34.625 align:middle line:84%
because your physiology
is going to change--

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:35.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:36.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- in
regard to that.

00:51:36.894 --> 00:51:38.529 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
this is important is

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.698 align:middle line:84%
because when we're trying
to get change to take place,

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:45.035 align:middle line:84%
when we're trying to
get conflict be resolved

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:48.472 align:middle line:84%
and when we're trying to
make peace to show up,

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:51.875 align:middle line:84%
when we're trying to get
human beings to communicate

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:55.479 align:middle line:84%
with each other, we want
to be really be mindful

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:58.515 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
wired for safekeeping.

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:01.819 align:middle line:84%
It's wired for the emotions
to go into protection on it.

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:03.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:52:03.187 --> 00:52:05.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And no matter how--
what we do is that we've got

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:09.259 align:middle line:84%
to get used to getting our brain
to communicate with itself.

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:52:10.394 --> 00:52:11.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And that's
going to be a big part

00:52:11.395 --> 00:52:13.197 align:middle line:84%
of our next discussion
'cause that--

00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:16.266 align:middle line:84%
those are the obstacles in the
environment, that we've got

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.001 align:middle line:84%
to like-- we've got
to deal with this--

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's a huge
piece, absolutely.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And-- yeah, so.

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:23.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, let's take a
look at Bill in the environment

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.776 align:middle line:84%
of teaching these
two group of people.

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:27.844 align:middle line:84%
This looks like so
much fun, take a look.

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:32.382 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: [Background Music]
Can I have four volunteers

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.086 align:middle line:84%
to please bring your
objection up to the front.

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:40.123 align:middle line:84%
When I transform into one of
the characters in the Matrix,

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:44.228 align:middle line:84%
what I'm trying to teach
is how to dodge voices

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:45.662 align:middle line:90%
of criticism and judgment.

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.832 align:middle line:84%
That we've got to work
on how we take things

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.368 align:middle line:84%
that are being said
in our direction.

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:54.938 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's from a boss or
during the sales process,

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:58.141 align:middle line:84%
conflict is inherent
in our language.

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:90%
You're just not right for this.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.946 align:middle line:90%
As I go into a physical motion.

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:05.015 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like, "Oh, I'm
coming around to get you."

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.484 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving a slow motion punch.

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:10.854 align:middle line:84%
What that really means
is I'm giving you time

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:14.291 align:middle line:84%
to actually see the tragic
sentence that is coming.

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So the participant can grab and
pull the conflict pass then.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:23.233 align:middle line:84%
Notice how he's grabbing before
he used any words at all.

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:25.102 align:middle line:90%
And not carry that on.

00:53:25.102 --> 00:53:29.439 align:middle line:84%
Put these cards in order most
like you to least like you.

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:32.609 align:middle line:84%
Pick up your cards, all of
them and you're going to walk

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.244 align:middle line:90%
to the following quadrants.

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.114 align:middle line:84%
During the whole brain
walkaround, what happens is,

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:38.448 align:middle line:90%
is that audience gets up

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:40.917 align:middle line:84%
and they walked the four
corners of the room.

00:53:40.917 --> 00:53:44.187 align:middle line:84%
And each one of those corners
is a different thinking style.

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
No sentences over
five words please.

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:48.325 align:middle line:90%
You'll have all that right?

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:52.396 align:middle line:84%
Great. They get a greater sense
of how each different part

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:54.765 align:middle line:84%
of the brain communicates
very differently.

00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:57.301 align:middle line:84%
Just raise your hands
in the air and say,

00:53:57.301 --> 00:54:00.504 align:middle line:84%
"We need your super
powers for our ideas."

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:02.139 align:middle line:90%
I want to really make sure

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:05.475 align:middle line:84%
that the participants
have the aha moments.

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:07.978 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just
got why, you know,

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:10.781 align:middle line:84%
me and my coworker can't
speak very well together.

>> Help us...

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.951 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, I'm feeling
so much better now.

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:20.057 align:middle line:84%
I really strive to make the
presentations fun and engaging

00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:23.427 align:middle line:84%
so that the audience
gets a sense

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:25.462 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
something that's boring.

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:90%
This is not a lecture.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.498 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:29.599 align:middle line:90%
Got it, click.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.001 align:middle line:90%
I love what I do.

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a blast.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.839 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm energized by it.

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:39.743 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been speaking for
22 years and I bring that kind

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:43.213 align:middle line:84%
of quality and consistency of
years of experience as well

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:46.917 align:middle line:84%
as a depth of knowledge and why
people think the way they do.

00:54:46.917 --> 00:54:49.186 align:middle line:84%
Bring your list of 10
things to me and we'll go

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:51.355 align:middle line:84%
over how you got
frustrated in the world.

00:54:51.355 --> 00:54:54.791 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a keynote,
a 90-minute piece

00:54:54.791 --> 00:55:00.731 align:middle line:84%
or a day-long training, wow,
see, the participants come away

00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:04.668 align:middle line:84%
with real practical tools
that one month later,

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.370 align:middle line:84%
they're still using
that information.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.004 align:middle line:90%
Was it fun?

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.907 align:middle line:90%

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.142 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much everybody.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.844 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: All right, this has
been incredibly illuminating

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.115 align:middle line:84%
on how to communicate
with people.

00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:21.451 align:middle line:84%
First of all to understand
ourselves and secondly,

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:25.822 align:middle line:84%
how to understand other people
and figure out how to be heard

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.991 align:middle line:84%
and feel heard with our
communication with other people.

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:28.925 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I want to continue with you.

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.529 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring you back
because there's so much more

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.131 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't even touched on.

00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So thank you so
much to your contribution

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.803 align:middle line:84%
and for teaching us how to
relate better with people

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:42.038 align:middle line:84%
and solve the heck of a
lot of conflict out there.

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:44.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's been a lot of
fun and I really look forward

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:47.344 align:middle line:84%
to the next time that we get
a chance to come back together

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:49.679 align:middle line:90%
and go further down this place

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:51.481 align:middle line:84%
to integrate these
different concepts.

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm sure
there's so much more.

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.017 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.
