00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: The
most common question

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
my guest today Dr.
Joe Dispenza hears

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is, why is it so hard
to break an old habit,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:90%
and how do you do it?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Most people wait until it's
almost too late in order

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You can learn and change
in a state of suffering,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
or you can learn and
change in a state of joy.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:90%
You choose.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscientific researcher
Dr. Joe Dispenza

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
is an expert in the role of
function and the human brain.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
He creates a bridge between
true human potential

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and the latest scientific
theories of neuroplasticity.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:10%
He is a "New York
Times" bestselling

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:10%
author of "Breaking the
Habit of Being Yourself,"

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
"You Are the Placebo,"
and his latest book,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
"Becoming Supernatural."

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Hi, Lisa.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be with you.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So happy to
be with you as well.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:10%
So I was talking about
that state of crisis.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And we do-- I'm saying we,
because I get there, too--

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:10%
hitting rock bottom, crisis,
states of incoherence.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Why do we keep doing
that same habit?

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Well, a habit
is a redundant set

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
of automatic,
unconscious thoughts,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
behaviors, and emotions that's
acquired through repetition.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:10%
Habit is when you've done
something so many times

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:10%
that your body
literally knows how

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.415 align:middle line:10%
to do it better than your mind.

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
It turns out by the
time we're 35 years old,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:10%
we're a set of
memorized programs.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So the body is functioning,
and the mind is unconscious.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So when there's
crisis or there's

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
trauma or disease or
diagnosis or loss,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
the event sometimes causes
people to feel so differently

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
than themselves that they
can finally see themselves

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes
of somebody else.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that moment in neuroscience
is called metacognition.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment where
we start paying attention

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
to how we think.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
We start thinking about
what we're thinking about.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
We start noticing how we're
acting, how we're speaking.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
We start becoming aware of
the emotions that we live by.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
start observing

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:84%
those states of mind and body,
you're no longer the program.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You're the consciousness
observing that program.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to objectify
our subjective self.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can't read the label

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.905 align:middle line:90%
when you're inside the jar.

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get out of the jar
to be able to see who you are.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So most people wait
for that moment

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
where they feel so bad
they could finally begin

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:90%
to make an effort to change.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
times are changing.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And my message is, why wait?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Why not just start creating
a future every day,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and begin to think differently,
and begin to act differently,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
and begin to feel differently?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that enough times,
that becomes the new habit.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It becomes
the new habit.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
But when the crisis--

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
because things are
so accelerated now,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.147 align:middle line:84%
and the more that
we get into crisis,

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like a wheel.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:90%
You just spin.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Or I just spin.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to say you.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.439 align:middle line:84%
When that upset
happens-- say you're

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
coherence and it's great--

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
loss of a loved one,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
or there's a flood
in your house,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or something breaks the
state that's not small.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Sure.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, we may not be
able to control everything

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:90%
in our outer world.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: But we certainly can
control our inner world.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not so
important to not react.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody reacts.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I react.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how long
are you going to react?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep an
emotional reaction going

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
on for an extended
period of time,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
you're memorizing that
emotion, and your body

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
as the unconscious
mind is believing

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
it's living in the same past
experience 24 hours a day,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
7 days a week, 365 days a year.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't
know the difference

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
between the real experience
that produces the emotion

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.283 align:middle line:84%
and emotion that we
create by thought alone.

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So then the emotion then
reaffirms the state.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And then people start to use
the problems and the conditions

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.485 align:middle line:84%
in their life to keep
that emotion going.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would call
that an addiction.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So we become addicted to the
very life we don't even like.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
then for people

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to realize then when you
have that moment where

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
you have crisis or something
breaks down, that you

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:90%
do have control over it.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's a formula.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's a skill.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And our research shows
that you can teach people

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
how to do that.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you're
living by some emotion,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.271 align:middle line:84%
there will always be a gap
between the way things appear

00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and the way things really are.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Emotions alter our perception.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you act during
that time, you'll

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
always say the same thing.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
I should have never said that.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I should have never done that.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I should have
never thought that.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I should have never
sent that email.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So then shortening your
emotional reactions

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
is a level of
intelligence then that

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.647 align:middle line:84%
causes you then to recalibrate,
because most people don't think

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:90%
they have control over it.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, that
person did it to me.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
That circumstance is the
reason I am this way.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Then I would say, if something
in your outer environment

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.022 align:middle line:84%
is controlling your
thoughts and feelings,

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
then you're a victim
to your environment.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And yet how you think and
feel creates your outer world.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking and
feeling equal to everything

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that's known in your
present personal reality,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
you keep creating
more of the same.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So to change then
is to think and feel

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
greater than the conditions
in your environment,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to do that
to such a degree then

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer reacting to
the same people in the same way.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And that takes an effort.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy in the beginning.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But once you start practicing,
you get better at it.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And just like anything else, you
start to move through your life

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:90%
with more coherence.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're less
likely to knee jerk.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you're less
likely to knee jerk,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
then you're not in an
unconscious program.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you say
there's a formula.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it an anchor or
something that you

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
can set to break that
habit, break that pattern

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
from going into the crisis
mode or the overreaction

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:90%
or the victimization?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Well, look,
I mean, everybody

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.146 align:middle line:84%
I believe has done something
great in their life.

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's done
something great.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:90%
You just got a wild idea, right?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You got a vision of
some possibility.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.264 align:middle line:84%
You were struggling with
your present circumstances,

00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you weren't so

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.056 align:middle line:84%
interested in checking your
cell phone every two minutes.

00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:29.638 align:middle line:84%
You weren't so interested in the
dinner that you were supposed

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to go to or the person
you usually call up

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.821 align:middle line:90%
and complain to.

00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Picking up your phone.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.361 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Yeah, you're not
interested in television shows.

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you start
thinking and contemplating,

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:90%
is there a new way to do this?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Is there a better way?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
What would it be
like to be healthy,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
to be happy, to be free,
to have a new career,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%
a new relationship?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.774 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
ask that question,

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
you turn on the creative
center in your brain,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
your frontal lobe.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:90%
The workshop.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And the frontal
lobe has connections

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to the entire
landscape of the brain.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it wants to
answer that question.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the forebrain.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where we
speculate possibilities.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:90%
We invent.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:90%
We have a tension or intention.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So we say, what would it be
like to have a new career?

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And the frontal lobe
goes, OK, let's look

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to see what we have
stored in the brain.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a certain
amount of knowledge

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.848 align:middle line:84%
and a certain amount
of experience.

00:07:15.848 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to select these
different networks of neurons,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and begins to call them up
in relation to that question.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain starts firing
in tandem, all of a sudden you

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
get a picture in your mind.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:90%
That's called intention.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:84%
You're selecting a new
potential in the quantum field.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, to the
passionate person, the

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
thought that they're having in
their mind literally becomes

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the end product
of an experience

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:90%
is called an emotion.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But now they're not feeling
sadness or pain or suffering

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
or fear.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling gratitude.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.596 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling inspired.

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They're feeling optimistic.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling a
heart-centered emotion.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine
a clear intention

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, you're beginning

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:84%
to change your brain
and body from living

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
in the past present
reality to living

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:90%
in the future present reality.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger the
emotion that you feel,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll pay attention
to the picture in your mind.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And now you're beginning
to emboss the circuitry

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in your brain creating
a long-term memory

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally conditioning
your body into that future.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And we could say then you're
remembering your future.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Now, the idea
then is to get up

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and to get your behaviors
to match your intentions.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to then stay conscious
of those thoughts that say,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%
start tomorrow.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm too tired.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.215 align:middle line:90%
This will never work.

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work last time.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be the
governor of those thoughts.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.765 align:middle line:84%
You've got to start
making different choices.

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And the hardest
part about change

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.373 align:middle line:84%
is not making the same
choices as the day before.

00:08:41.373 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over and over.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: So you've got to review
the choices that you're not

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
going to make.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.822 align:middle line:84%
You've got to think
about the behaviors

00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:90%
you're going to change.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Even how you speak.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
What experiences do
you need to stay away

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
from certain people and
certain places and times?

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And what emotions bring
you to a lower denominator

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that causes you to no
longer see that vision?

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Because that emotion,
that familiar emotion

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause you
to view your future

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of the past.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So then when you combine
a thought and a feeling,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:90%
it's called a state of being.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So then your job is to
maintain that modified

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
state of mind and
body your entire day,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to keep your energy
up, independent

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of other people and the
conditions in your life,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
independent of the habits
and emotional addictions

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and
independent of time.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I say if you do that
properly, get ready,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
because something unusual is
going to happen in your life.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.399 align:middle line:90%
It's the law.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to come in a way
that you've never thought of.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the unknown.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the surprise.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The brain learns by
mistakes and surprises.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Why not have a few surprises?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So then the moment you start
feeling a familiar emotion

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
or you go back to an
old state of being,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
you've disconnected
from your future.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And you're back to your past.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't expect anything to change.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you say it's that
person that did it to me,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say,
great, but that's

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%
being a victim to your life.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:90%
So then it takes practice.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's trial and error.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are days where
you have just a connection.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And it flows.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's smooth.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And other days, you're getting
hit from every direction,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
because the universe is
saying, you want wealth?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:90%
You want freedom?

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
You want health?

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me show
you how much you

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
have to be initiated to
maintain that state independent

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of those conditions.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, now no person,
no thing will move you from it.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Now it's permanent.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And people are now beginning
to understand that.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the person
who heals themselves

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
from a disease in our
work, they say to me,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
the disease exists in
the old personality.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist
with me anymore.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready for
the next challenge.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to be challenged.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I was more alive when
I was challenged.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.471 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Now you're no longer
contracting from your life.

00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:90%
You're engaging in life.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
healthy way to live.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
This is your example
of your personality

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
creates your personal reality,
your personality change,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and it creates your personality.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:90%
I think that's beautifully said.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Well, your personality
is made up of how you think,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:90%
how you act, and how you feel.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So the present personality
who's watching this show

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
has created the present personal
reality called their life.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense if
you want to create

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
a new personal reality,
a new life, you've

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
got to change your
personality, which

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:84%
means you've got to start
thinking about what you've

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
been thinking about.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Start modifying your behaviors
and noticing how you feel.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that enough
times, sooner or later

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to disengage
from that old personality.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But the next step
is, what thoughts

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
do I want to fire
and wire in my brain?

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do I want
to demonstrate in one day,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:90%
in one lifetime?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And the act of closing
your eyes and rehearsing

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
your behaviors, mental
rehearsal actually

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
installs neurological
circuits in your brain.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You're priming your brain to
begin to become that person.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And then if you say, can I
teach my body emotionally

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
what my future is going to
feel like before it happens?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
wait for your health

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.067 align:middle line:90%
to feel wholeness and gratitude.

00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to wait
for your new relationship

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:90%
to feel love.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the old model of
reality of cause and effect.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You're actually going to
cause an effect, which

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.772 align:middle line:84%
means the moment you
start feeling gratitude

00:12:17.772 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and wholeness, your
healing begins.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
falling in love with life,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, you
create an equal.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So now you're causing an effect.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So then people who do this
consistently, they literally

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
create a new personality.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they create
a new personal reality.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.941 align:middle line:90%
Their life changes.

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.731 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
different opportunities

00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%
that begin to show up.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.073 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: It takes time
in the beginning,

00:12:39.073 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because breaking the habit
of some aspect of yourself

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.315 align:middle line:84%
requires a constant
state of awareness.

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was-- I was going
to ask you, how much time?

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because can this
happen in an instant,

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:84%
as you've seen in
your workshops?

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:59.025 align:middle line:84%
Or can it happen over
repetitive meditation and going

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
through that experience
over and over in your mind?

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Gosh.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, Lisa, I'm in
such a interesting place,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
because I never
thought that I would

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
see what I'm witnessing
in my lifetime

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
in the way people are
engaging in this work.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's like
the four-minute mile.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The four-minute mile was just
a barrier of consciousness.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing people, not
one, not two, not three, not

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
four, not five, with stage IV
cancer, or Parkinson's disease,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
or lupus, or
tumors, or whatever.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
They stand in front of an
audience, and they say,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.467 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely cancer free.

00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:90%
And they tell their story.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's not glamorous.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They've lost everything.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.717 align:middle line:90%
They've lost their job.

00:13:46.717 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
They had bankruptcy.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
They were sick.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:90%
They lost people.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were challenged.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.209 align:middle line:90%
And they kept doing the work.

00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
They could have said,
I don't feel like it.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm too tired.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm too sick.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:90%
It takes too long.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I have too many things to do.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They never excused
themselves from that effort.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.431 align:middle line:84%
And so when you witness
that in an audience--

00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Again and again.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.179 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Again and again
and again, not only

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
are you piercing a
veil of consciousness,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
like the four-minute mile that
allows other people to do it,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:90%
but it's not only in the field.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But you're witnessing
the evidence.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot go back to
being the same person again.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:90%
So the woman is 68 years old.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:90%
She has Parkinson's disease.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.414 align:middle line:90%
Her face was paralyzed.

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't do many things.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.691 align:middle line:90%
She could barely speak.

00:14:27.691 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And now she's standing on
the stage telling her story.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
And she's jumping up and down.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have to think,
well, if it happens to her,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:90%
it could possibly happen to me.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So then there's a
new normal that's

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
beginning to take place,
a new standard, where

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
people are beginning
to go, it is possible.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand that I
can upregulate new genes

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and downregulate old genes.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Now I can rewire my brain.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doomed to this.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And so just like an infection
spreads amongst a community

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and creates a disease, I believe
that health and wellness can

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
be as infectious as disease.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you get enough
people together,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
you start seeing those
miraculous things.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe now
in watching people

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that every time somebody
makes the effort

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
or has a transformation, that
information is in the field.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%
It's in the quantum.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, it's also being

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
spread in
three-dimensional reality,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.564 align:middle line:90%
because the evidence is here.

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
measurements to prove it,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
we have the people's
experience to prove it,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and we have momentum.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And so some people--

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.245 align:middle line:84%
the true pathfinders,
the trailblazers.

00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.024 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Some of them, it
took them three years

00:15:37.024 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to reverse a genetic
condition that the doctor said

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:90%
was impossible to change.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Now people who have seen that
person with the same condition

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that they have are doing it
in a shorter amount of time.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So there is a momentum.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Because there's a
shift in consciousness.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen it take
years for certain people.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Long haul.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:90%
But they made it.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
But they laid footprints
for other people.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does help.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it helps.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:90%
When you see it, you believe it.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: This is a time in history
where it's not enough to know.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a time in
history to know how.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And evidence speaks for itself.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've done so many
brain scans and so many HRV

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
measurements and genetic
tests and telomere

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
tests and immune system
regulation and energy tests,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:84%
because I want people
to see the evidence.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in their mind.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's in their brain.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not just--
it's in their body.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
We want to prove to
people that it's possible.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.921 align:middle line:84%
So then you scratch
your head and say,

00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
if that happens to
that person, they

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:90%
don't look like a movie star.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not like
a famous person.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not a Buddhist monk.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
They just look like
a normal person.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And they're
not all vegetarians.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And they're not all celibate.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.862 align:middle line:84%
And they don't-- some
of them drink wine.

00:16:44.862 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
just normal people.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that creates
some type of community

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that transcends all
the things that people

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
do matter to matter.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You do all the right
things matter to matter.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:90%
You change your diet.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:90%
You exercise.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
All important.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you're living
by some emotion,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
if the environment
signals the gene,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:84%
and the end product of an
experience in the environment

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.114 align:middle line:84%
is an emotion, and you
live by the same emotion

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
every single day,
you're signaling

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
the same gene in the same way.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later that gene
is going to begin to break down.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Change your emotional state and
understand why you're doing it

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and assign meaning to it.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And every day you get up, a
different emotional state,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
you are knocking on
the genetic door,

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and sooner or later you're
going to reprogram that gene.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: And we've seen it.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
you break genetics.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
That's how you break history.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Change your
genetic destiny.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It is possible.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You spend a large
amount of your times

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
in these incredible
week-long intensives.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to show you an
example of what happens so you

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:90%
can get a feeling for it.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE: If you come
to the monastery

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:10%
and you pretend to be limited
by your problems in your life

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:10%
because you talk about
them all the time,

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.769 align:middle line:10%
that's the body and
brain you'll be wearing.

00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:10%
If you're laying in bed
and you've given yourself

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:10%
the line you're going to do
it later, do it tomorrow,

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:10%
now is the new
later at this event.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:10%
Get up, and just take your body.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Don't let it reason
with you, because it's

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:10%
going to talk you out of
possibility, because you just

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:10%
won't feel like it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:10%
I want you to
understand that we're

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:10%
going to push you outside
of where you normally stop.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:10%
And if you're willing to truly
put all of your attention

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:10%
and effort into this, you will
begin to transform yourself

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:10%
and you'll begin to
transform your life.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Once we overcome ourselves,
magic starts to happen.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:10%
Miracles start to occur.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:10%
The mysticism, the
energy of it, literally,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:10%
begins to shape and
condition the space.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.904 align:middle line:10%
And you will witness
miracles this week.

00:18:45.904 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:10%
You will witness them.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:54.952 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It looks like people
are in this incredible field

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:10%
from all walks of life.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
How do you create that
over and over again?

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: I know a few things now.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I now know that after looking
at all these brain scans

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and studying people, I
believe that you and I are

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
at our absolute best when
we get beyond ourselves.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: When you
forget about yourself,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that is the moment
you are connecting

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to something greater.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The first couple days of
these week-long events--

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
people come for all
kinds of reasons.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:90%
They have a disease.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:90%
They have a loss.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They want a new life.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.534 align:middle line:90%
They want a new relationship.

00:19:31.534 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
They want to have a
mystical experience.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:90%
They just want to learn.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:90%
All different reasons.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And that first day, they
come with all their problems,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%
all their thoughts.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty much beat
up from their environment.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And we get them
through that first day

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
where they start to connect.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And by that second
day, they start really

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:90%
starting to feel a change.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens and people
start popping, then I know then

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work with the group
to create that ecstatic state.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
miraculous happens.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I also know that I never
try to do it the same way as I

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:90%
did the time before.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in the quantum,
predictability and repetition

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
are two things
you just can't do.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:90%
So I trust the audience.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I trust the movement.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
We have usually 40 to
50 different cultures

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
at our week-long events
from all over the world.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:90%
They're large events.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have such a
strong community.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And that community
is bound by love.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's bound by elevated states.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So it happens all
different ways.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But the outcomes
are always the same.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:90%
We witness the miraculous.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had an event
in Toronto where you actually

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
had this entire 1,000
people propelling off

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:90%
the top of the hotel.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of this before.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Well, let me break it
down so it's really simple.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Over the
last six years, we

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
have done extensive
scientific tests on meditation

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and the work that we do.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in creating
brain coherence, brain order,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
synchronization,
and heart coherence.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And our students based
on our measurements

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:90%
can do that very well.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing it in
a room with 1,000 people.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
The music's playing.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It's quiet.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It's soft.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
They're comfortable.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And they can relax
into it and really

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
work on their inner
world and actually follow

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
the instructions and be able
to connect to that process.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a formula.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.492 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking
when we started

00:21:39.492 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
doing these week-long events.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if we create an
activity that would normally

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
bring up an emotion, a
stressful emotion like fear?

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fear.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Or doubt,
or unworthiness,

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
or voices in their
head start running.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, eyes
open, when it counts the most

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to be able to self-regulate,
to stop and realize

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that they can settle
their brain and body down,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and practice it now
with the condition that

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:90%
would be challenging them.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've done seven or so
events, week-long events.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to Toronto,
I was doing a lecture there.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And I went and checked out the
hotel we were negotiating with.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was no room for the
course that we normally create.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:90%
So the only way to go was up.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the building,
and I thought, OK, this

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:84%
would be an edge that would
be a great teaching if people

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:90%
could come to their edge.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We all have an edge in our life.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And be able
to in that moment

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
when fear could really grip
you, to make one of two choices.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Either to forget everything you
learned and go into panic mode

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and go back into survival,
or say, I've got this.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a minute,
and let me regulate here.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And begin to practice
what they've learned

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and take it to the next level.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
importance of that?

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Number one, if they can
do that in that moment--

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.304 align:middle line:90%
and we measure that, by the way.

00:23:06.304 --> 00:23:07.844 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
measuring their field.

00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: We're measuring
their heart response.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.305 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And so when you're
fearful, your heart's racing.

00:23:13.305 --> 00:23:14.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Adrenaline, yeah.

00:23:14.346 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: But many of them settled
that whole function down,

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
which means then if they
can go over the edge

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and literally change
that, when they come

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to the edge in their life, to
the challenge in their life

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that normally causes them to go
unconscious and run a program,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:84%
then in that moment
in their life,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
this is when it
matters the most.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.052 align:middle line:90%
That's just the metaphor.

00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
When they do it in
their life and they're

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
able to self-regulate,
they'll be

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
more kind and more compassionate
and more aware and more caring

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and more loving and more giving
when everybody else is being

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
angry and hostile and fearful.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:90%
This is the test right here.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And if the scale of that
event is so challenging,

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:84%
when they face the
problems in their life,

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.335 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
like, are you kidding me?

00:24:04.335 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I just went over the
edge and 38 floors.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And so their perception about
the challenges in their life

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.984 align:middle line:90%
begin to change as well.

00:24:13.984 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we've had
numerous breakthroughs.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We had people of
all ages doing it.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a teaching that goes
with it, because this is not

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:90%
an adrenaline high.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not what I'm teaching.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't want it to be
an adrenaline rush.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually am
after the opposite.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking for them to take
adrenaline and settle it

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
down and change their brain
and body in that moment

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:84%
so they can overcome
that emotional state.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you can do
it in that moment,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that is the moment
that matters the most.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Then when you come to
the edge in your life,

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to move
through that edge.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.205 align:middle line:84%
And then there will
be another edge.

00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Another edge.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.651 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And you've got
to move through that.

00:24:50.651 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But at least you'll
have a tool to be

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.411 align:middle line:84%
able to do it without just
reacting unconsciously.

00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because once
you do it, your brain

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.704 align:middle line:90%
then creates that memory.

00:24:59.704 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: You experience.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The experience then is
logged in your brain.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And you say, give me a minute.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And so many people, the emails
that we get now, so many people

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
are just saying, my life
just seems just so easy.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm just moving through
it so much easier.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not reacting to
the same conditions.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad I went
over the edge.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean that
it wasn't scary for them.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're giving
them a meditation

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to do so they can get
in the right state.

Now, some of the measurements
that we're getting now, just to

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:90%
talk about brain coherence.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But we started out
on this venture.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And we started measuring
brain coherence.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, your brain has 100
billion neurons, right?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's networks that are
all kind of wired together.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have a network
to speak a language.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You have a network
to move a body part.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You have a network to see
certain shapes and colors.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
They're all just
individual networks.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're living
by the hormones of stress

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're reacting to something
and your body's knocked out

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.944 align:middle line:84%
of balance, when
you're in stress,

00:30:01.944 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:84%
you can't predict
the next moment.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You have the perception that
things are going to get worse.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You have the thought that
you're losing control.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.279 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
these chemicals switch on

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:84%
so that you're in
survival and you're

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
mobilizing enormous
amounts of energy

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to prepare yourself for whatever
it is in the environment.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Short term, it's cool.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can handle that.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:84%
All organisms can adapt
to short-term stress.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But if the stressors
keep coming,

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
control and predict

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.340 align:middle line:84%
everything in your life, and
you're switching your attention

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:84%
from your cell phone to your
problems to your husband

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to the shopping
to another person,

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:90%
or your boss, another thing.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Every person, every object,
every thing, every place

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:84%
has a neurological
network in your brain.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So as the hormones are
arousing your brain

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and you shift your
attention, if you

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:84%
were to measure the brain
when it's doing that,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
you have different networks
that are firing out of order.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And you measure that.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like a group of people
that have no rhythm playing

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:90%
the drums at the same time.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.805 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally incoherent.

00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Just incoherence.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in a state
like that, what happens mostly

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
is you narrow your
attention on the danger.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You begin to focus on an
object in your environment

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that's associated
with that danger.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So the stronger the emotion
you feel from some reaction

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:84%
or condition in
your life, the more

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:84%
you're going to pay
attention to the cause.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And if where you place your--

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The television.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Yeah, where you place
your attention is where

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:90%
you're placing your energy.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.086 align:middle line:84%
So you're giving
your power away--

00:31:25.086 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:90%
your boss-- to your problem.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So then what we've realized, and
research shows it over and over

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
again, that when you go from
that kind of single-minded

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
narrow focus-- that's
only one type of focus--

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you
begin to expand your focus,

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:84%
you begin to open
your awareness.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You go from focusing on
matter to focusing on energy,

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
from focusing on the
particle in quantum physics

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:90%
to focus on the wave.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
open your awareness,

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and you focus on nothing.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.420 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
start sensing space,

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:90%
you're no longer thinking.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.934 align:middle line:84%
If you're no longer thinking,
you're no longer analyzing.

00:32:00.934 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're no
longer analyzing,

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.674 align:middle line:84%
you're not activating those
circuits in your brain.

00:32:04.674 --> 00:32:08.159 align:middle line:84%
So your brainwaves
start to slow down,

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and the autonomic nervous
system begins to merge.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And the autonomic
nervous system now

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
wants to create order
and wholeness and balance

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:90%
and it says, Lisa's gone.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Joe's gone.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's get in here and create
order while they're gone,

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:90%
because what a mess.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden it
starts to synchronize

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
different compartments
in the brain.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And what sinks together
links together.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden the
brain starts functioning

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:90%
in a more holistic state.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen in
our work when people

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
start getting these
different networks starting

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to synchronize, we can now
predict what's going to happen.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:90%
We can say watch this.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.202 align:middle line:84%
We can say to scientists that
come and watch our work, watch

00:32:42.202 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:90%
what happens with this woman.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Just keep watching.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you see the right half

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.415 align:middle line:84%
of the brain talking to
the left half of the brain.

00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden these two
hemispheres come together,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and the union of polarity,
the union of duality,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
the union of opposites, it's
called wholeness, oneness.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And the brain has
this psychic union.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the
heart burst wide open.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the person's
feeling so whole

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.868 align:middle line:90%
they no longer want anything.

00:33:04.868 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how could you
want when you're whole?

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So now the heart is coherent.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.259 align:middle line:84%
And it's sending more
energy to the brain.

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:11.175 align:middle line:90%
The brain is coherent.

00:33:11.175 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's sending more
information to the body.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And all this
sudden, the person's

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:90%
in a whole new state of being.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, that was our
research last year.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, this year, when we start
seeing that level of coherence,

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden now we are
going to levels of energy

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that have
never been recorded

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:90%
in the history of neuroscience.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Accessed.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: That now a person
is connecting to the field.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And they are hundreds of
standard deviations outside

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
of normal in a brainwave
state called gamma.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Now they're super conscious.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And not just one
part of the brain,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:84%
the entire brain is in this
super, super conscious state.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.357 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is going on
between that person's ears

00:33:49.357 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
is more real than this world
we're sitting in right now.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They're having a full-on
sensory experience

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:90%
without their senses.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And they can't make
their brain do that.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.749 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to them.

00:33:58.749 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's not happening with one
person, two people, or three.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the same patterns
over and over again.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know
they can induce it.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.844 align:middle line:90%
We now know how to create it.

00:34:08.844 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
And we now know we can predict
when it's about to happen.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I can say, watch this.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.980 align:middle line:90%
She's going to pop.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.781 align:middle line:90%
She's going to go.

00:34:14.781 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:90%
Well, just keep watching.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And when a brain
scientist looks at this,

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they
think is seizure.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.614 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh!

00:34:21.614 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: They've never
seen anything like this.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.155 align:middle line:84%
And they're, oh, she's
having a seizure.

00:34:25.155 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I say, does she look
like she's having a seizure?

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
She's just totally connected,
a big smile on her face.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
Her brain is just in a
super, super aroused state.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But the arousal is not
coming from some threat

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.323 align:middle line:90%
in her environment.

00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
The arousal is
coming from within.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, her energy is
moving up into her brain.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.219 align:middle line:84%
And that level of coherence,
normal coherence-- incoherence

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
is like a group of people
in an audience clapping

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a show.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:52.499 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: OK.

00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So then normal brain coherence
is like every five people

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.680 align:middle line:90%
clapping.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Super coherence is when
everybody's clapping in rhythm.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of order
creates energy in the brain.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden you see
the scale of energy going up.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.718 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps building
and keeps building.

00:35:09.718 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
That person is having
a mystical experience

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.844 align:middle line:84%
that is going to
transform them forever.

00:35:13.844 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be the same person.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And so many times we
see like health conditions

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:84%
disappear in one second. in
one second, because they're

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.204 align:middle line:90%
getting a biological upgrade.

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In that state.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: In that state.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.096 align:middle line:84%
Because experience
enriches the brain.

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And the end product of an
experience is an emotion.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And now a new emotion
is signaling the body.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's not an emotion like
a chemical, it's electric.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When that
brain mapping happens,

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.373 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at the
coherence in the brain,

00:35:39.373 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:90%
is it a color?

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it the full brain?

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: You can see it
many different ways.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the technology
is so amazing.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But the simple way to see is you
have 19 different compartments

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:90%
that are being measured.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And you have this little thing.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You see the lines
all going like this.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here's beta.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Then it starts slowing down.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Alpha.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And then they go into theta.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But then when they go into
this super aroused state,

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.030 align:middle line:84%
just imagine grabbing a
handful of Crayola crayons

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:90%
and going like that.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow!

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: It looks
like a snow storm.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.921 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
Gamma looks like?

00:36:09.921 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: High, high, high
amplitudes in gamma.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't read anything.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a snowstorm.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have to figure out other
ways to view it and other ways

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.117 align:middle line:84%
to read it or scale it
down so we can see it.

00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Yeah, it's way
outside of normal.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As opposed to fear, what
does the brain look like there?

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.436 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Great question.

00:36:30.436 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So when a person's in fear, like
we're in normal beta brainwave

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:90%
We're awake.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:90%
We're aware.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're aware of our body
in an environment and in time.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you get aroused because
of some threat, from beta

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you move into what's called high
beta, a super aroused state.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Now the brain is vigilant.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It's scanning the
environment to predict

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen next.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So high beta is like
driving your sports car

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.246 align:middle line:90%
in first gear on the freeway.

00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
last very long.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: But when we see these
transitions into gamma,

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
gamma is actually a faster
frequency than beta.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the person moves
right through beta,

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
right through high
beta, right into gamma.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And because it's so orderly,
because most high beta is

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:90%
disorderly.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.027 align:middle line:84%
But when we see
that kind of order

00:37:19.027 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're passing
through high beta,

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:84%
we know they're going
to go right into gamma.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're going.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And they're going
to go into a very, very

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:90%
high amplitudes of gamma.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing
that we don't

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.830 align:middle line:84%
utilize this part of the
brain as often as we can.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that this is possible.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And from the experience
I went through having

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
a near-death experience,
I can never unsee that.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I will always know
and always seek

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
for this supernatural
state of being.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Yeah.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Always.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Yeah.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now that you
experience that, it's amazing.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Yeah.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And the people that come back,
their spectrum of reality

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.140 align:middle line:84%
broadens, because we don't
see things how they are.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:90%
We see things how we are, right?

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So the brain only perceives
equal to how we're wired

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and how we emotionally feel.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So imagine having a
full-on sensory experience

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:90%
without your senses right now.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
What if your senses were
heightened right now by 25%?

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything you were
seeing, hearing, smelling,

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:90%
tasting, feeling.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:84%
If your senses are
heightened by 25%,

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:84%
your awareness of everything
around you is heightened.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is consciousness.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't have consciousness
without energy.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So the brain gets
a rush of energy.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And now the experience lays
the tracks down in the brain.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And now when we come
back to our senses,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:84%
we are going to perceive a
broader spectrum of reality.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Now our brain is
wired to perceive

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.670 align:middle line:84%
what has always existed,
but we didn't have

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:90%
the circuits to perceive it.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And now the person's getting
a broader glimpse of reality.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And science says we perceive
less than 1% of reality.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, now they're
getting a glimpse.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But in that state as
you're describing this,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
disease is so tiny, and
illnesses is so small,

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.830 align:middle line:90%
and conflict is so tiny.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
When you really go to
that expanded time, that

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
senseless incredible
state, those little things,

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:90%
like a tumor, seem so small.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: The sacred is so much
grander than the mundane.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And so in a moment
a person is no longer

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:90%
in the labyrinth of life.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They are looking at it
from a different dimension.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:90%
They know where they need to go.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer asking
anybody for answers.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.234 align:middle line:90%
They're getting a download.

00:39:28.234 --> 00:39:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Download, yes.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: From the field.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
call it a download.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And with that download
comes a biological upgrade.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:90%
There is an upgrade.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Because all disease is
a lowering of frequency

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.940 align:middle line:90%
according to the quantum model.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:90%
It's incoherence.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:90%
The body is disorderly.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It's slowing down in frequency.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So now once the
system switches on

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden that person
is drawing from the field,

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:84%
get ready, because
the body is going

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to take on a new frequency.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And we see eczema disappear.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:90%
We see tumors shrink.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The diseases can
no longer exist,

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.230 align:middle line:90%
because there's getting a--

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:84%
there's a change in the human
operating system from energy.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.025 align:middle line:84%
Not from matter,
but from energy.

00:40:12.025 --> 00:40:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From energy.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
When someone's going through
something like a chemotherapy

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.800 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've seen this--

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:84%
radiation, where that tends
to be a denser frequency,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
can you see them shift
out of that state

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:84%
if they're currently going
through those therapies?

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Wow.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people that
tried every therapy

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
responding to anything.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:90%
But they trusted.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
run out of options.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.718 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And you're left
with nothing else.

00:40:41.718 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And it's framed in a
way that you can see that you

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.790 align:middle line:90%
can actually connect to.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about this.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:84%
How much of your
waking day do you

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:90%
have your attention on matter?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And how much of your waking
day do you have your attention

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.540 align:middle line:90%
on the field or energy?

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Most people are local
in space and time.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And so all of their
attention is on matter.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So in our work, we say when
you take your attention

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.352 align:middle line:84%
off your body,
you become nobody.

00:41:08.352 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:84%
When you take your
attention off all the people

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.194 align:middle line:84%
in your life and your
identity, you become no one.

00:41:13.194 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:84%
When you take your attention off
your cell phone, your computer,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.154 align:middle line:90%
your car, you're a no thing.

00:41:18.154 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:84%
When you take your attention
off the place you're sitting,

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.700 align:middle line:84%
the place you need to
be, you're in nowhere.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're not thinking
about the past or the future

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the present
moment, you're in no time.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment you
become pure consciousness.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment
you're disinvesting

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.674 align:middle line:84%
all of your attention
and energy out

00:41:33.674 --> 00:41:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of this three-dimensional
reality.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.173 align:middle line:84%
Now, this three-dimensional
reality is real to us,

00:41:37.173 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:84%
because we perceive
it with our senses.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum is a realm
that exists beyond the senses.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And you could only experience
it with your awareness.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:90%
So then imagine--

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's just as real.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: It's more real.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So then just because
you can't see something

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So then if I said to
you, pay attention to it.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Connect to it.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Become more aware of it.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Stay present with it.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Moment after moment after
moment, like a radio dial,

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.705 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system is
tuning into frequencies.

00:42:07.705 --> 00:42:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later you're not
doing it with your body.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.496 align:middle line:84%
If you're back in
your body, you're back

00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:12.860 align:middle line:90%
in three-dimensional reality.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to get beyond your
body, your environment,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the moment you're
on the bridge to the quantum

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.400 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to
connect to that field,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.760 align:middle line:84%
there are greater and greater
levels of order and oneness.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So then as you begin to
connect to that information

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and you look for it
and you tune into it,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
every time you feel something
your brain lays down a circuit.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what experience does.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Now you're putting
the circuits in place

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:90%
for you to perceive more of it.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you're focusing
on the divine,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.470 align:middle line:84%
you just may see the
divine in everybody.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Everything.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Because your
brain is wired for it.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it seeks for it.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:84%
There is this great video where
you show the metronome getting

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.190 align:middle line:90%
into that coherent field.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%
This is really impactful.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pay
attention to this.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: So then as you
start opening your focus

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and sensing space
and nothing, as you

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.480 align:middle line:84%
begin to unfold into
that infinite vast void,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.540 align:middle line:84%
the longer you can linger
there as an awareness,

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're touching and
tuning into a frequency called

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the unified field,
which's signature

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is order and rhythm,
which is wholeness,

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.300 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later coherence
is going to begin

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.814 align:middle line:90%
to consume incoherence.

00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
the brain will begin

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.025 align:middle line:90%
to become more integrated.

00:43:37.025 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.590 align:middle line:10%
>> He didn't know
anything about me.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:10%
And he knew that I had
PTSD, that I had ADD,

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:10%
I had the hypervigilance,
everything.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:10%
He could tell that by my brain.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:10%
And like I said, it
was kind of shocking,

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.200 align:middle line:10%
but it also gave
me a lot of hope,

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.980 align:middle line:10%
because I knew that
through this brain mapping,

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.370 align:middle line:10%
I could measure my progress.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And I actually had the
objective measurements.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.770 align:middle line:10%
The brain maps showed me I could
actually go into my meditations

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:22.230 align:middle line:10%
and use that information
in my meditations to help

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.365 align:middle line:10%
start to heal my myself.

00:44:24.365 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE: And all of
sudden, you see

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.300 align:middle line:10%
the front of the brain talking
to the back of the brain.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.300 align:middle line:10%
We've seen this so many times.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:10%
You see the right side
of the brain talking

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:10%
to the left side of the brain.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
you see the brain

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.690 align:middle line:10%
starting to move into
a more holistic state.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:10%
Those brain waves
become highly coherent.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.500 align:middle line:10%
When that happens, that energy
moves right into the heart.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.180 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
the person starts

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:10%
to feel connected to
something greater.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see that over
and over again where

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that negative thought
will cause everything

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to go out of balance.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And it'll cause total chaos.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And once I start
getting into nature

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.940 align:middle line:84%
or I find something that
gets me into coherence

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and pulls me back, it
will start to affect

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.110 align:middle line:90%
everything else in my body.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Sure.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it can be done.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.461 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
be a Buddhist monk.

00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to have--

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.880 align:middle line:84%
going through a full week-long
workshop is recommended,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.550 align:middle line:90%
but you can do it instantly.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.960 align:middle line:90%
It's all up to us.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Our research
shows that you actually

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.050 align:middle line:84%
don't need 40,000 hours
or 40 years of meditation.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it in a week.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.171 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a formula.

00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And once you lock
into that formula.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You keep saying formula.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Yeah.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.718 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
share that with us?

00:45:35.718 --> 00:45:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Or have you already?

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:37.465 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: No, I haven't.

00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the formula, of course,
is the different meditations

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: And I now know--

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.800 align:middle line:84%
it's so wild, because we've
done so many great measurements,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that in certain meditations
I can say certain words,

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and all 14 people that are
getting their brain scanned

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
will all go into gamma
at the same time.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: They're conditioned.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: They're conditioned.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So the formula is
we now know how

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.610 align:middle line:90%
to get people into that state.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And then once they're
in that state,

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.830 align:middle line:84%
now they're accessing
from the field.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They're connected to
something greater.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And now it becomes less
about changing matter.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't change matter.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the illusion.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.749 align:middle line:90%
They just change the field.

00:46:17.749 --> 00:46:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you change the
field, it changes matter.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So people are changing their
beliefs on how that's done.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So the formula then is
getting to that point where

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they get beyond themselves
and they're connecting

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to the consciousness of
everybody, of everyone,

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of everything, of
everywhere, of every time.

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:90%
That is the oneness field.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:90%
That is the field.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the
information exists.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Now, there's a caveat
to this, because we've

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
seen this so many times.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Because when you reach that
moment, all the things that you

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.400 align:middle line:84%
thought you wanted,
you no longer want,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.620 align:middle line:84%
because you feel like
you have everything.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Complete.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And it's a
very unusual feeling,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because the side effect
of that is that you now

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:01.410 align:middle line:84%
are less interested in anything
outside of you bringing you

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.090 align:middle line:90%
joy.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.350 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from within you.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you want.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So then imagine, like our
students, certain people,

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.900 align:middle line:84%
their oxytocin levels
go up 200 or 300 times

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a workshop.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Oxytocin is the love chemical.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: So imagine having
so much love for life.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, oxytocin
levels, Lisa, normally

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:84%
go up when a female mammal is
bonding with her offspring,

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
or in the beginning
stages of a relationship

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and there's intimacy,
the oxytocin

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.750 align:middle line:84%
creates monogamy and
bonding and stuff.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And my colleagues that look
at my research, they say,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.334 align:middle line:84%
why you measuring oxytocin
in your workshops?

00:47:42.334 --> 00:47:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's normally
in the honeymoon stage

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of a relationship.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.100 align:middle line:90%
What are you guys doing there?

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I want
our students to fall

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:50.415 align:middle line:84%
in love with their future,
fall in love with the divine.

00:47:50.415 --> 00:47:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have to, yes.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: And my goodness.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So then when oxytocin
levels go up 200 times,

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
imagine having
feeling so much love

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't want to trade this
feeling for anyone or anything.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How are you
measuring oxytocin?

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.647 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: We're doing--

00:48:05.647 --> 00:48:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Blood tests?

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.012 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Blood,
saliva, everything.

00:48:09.012 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have people pee
in cups, spitting in cups.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.960 align:middle line:90%
We're puncturing people.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.420 align:middle line:84%
But imagine, imagine, this
is an important point,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because what is
unconditional love?

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it when you
just allow people?

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having so much, feeling
that consistent feeling.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It's measured in
their oxytocin levels,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.790 align:middle line:84%
their neurotransmitters,
their heart coherence.

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
brain system switched on.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You would say, I'm not going
to give this feeling up

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:90%
for anyone or anything.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:39.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the moment you're free.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the
moment where you're

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.420 align:middle line:84%
less likely to rely on
anybody outside of you

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.530 align:middle line:90%
to bring you love.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:48.069 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you just feel
love for no reason.

00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's exactly
what's happening

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:84%
right here, right now, and for
anyone watching this video.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:59.480 align:middle line:84%
They can easily tune into this
field of coherence and love.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: Well, of course, I have
to remind them of everything

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:84%
they're about to do
and why we're doing it,

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.954 align:middle line:90%
a lot of information.

00:49:05.954 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Get them sharing
that information.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I now know, Lisa, if I can
get a group of people together

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and I can give them sound
scientific information.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And science is the contemporary
language of mysticism.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Science is what
demystifies the mystical.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.852 align:middle line:84%
The moment you talk religion
or culture or tradition,

00:49:22.852 --> 00:49:25.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to divide an
audience, because someone's

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
going to switch off.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you science,
science creates

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:90%
that kind of unification.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So every time you learn
something new-- you know this.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.400 align:middle line:84%
You've seen the videos--
you make new connections

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.690 align:middle line:90%
in your brain, right?

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm combining quantum
physics with neuroscience,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.500 align:middle line:84%
neuroendocrinology,
psychoimmunology, epigenetics,

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and I'm putting it
together in a model for them

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand, they're
learning that information.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, if learning is
making new connections,

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:90%
remembering is maintaining them.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.812 align:middle line:84%
So if I say to them, turn
to the person next to you

00:49:53.812 --> 00:49:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and explain what I just said,
if they can't explain it,

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.884 align:middle line:90%
it's not wired in their brain.

00:49:58.884 --> 00:50:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So between the two people,
they start building

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.480 align:middle line:90%
a model of understanding.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And they start--

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.958 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear about your
past or any other theories.

00:50:05.958 --> 00:50:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Just repeat what I said.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So as they begin to fire
and wire those circuits,

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.560 align:middle line:84%
they're installing the
neurological hardware

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.930 align:middle line:84%
in their brain in preparation
for an experience.

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more they understand
what they're doing and why,

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.084 align:middle line:90%
the how gets easier.

00:50:19.084 --> 00:50:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So then if I can set up the
conditions and the environment

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.186 align:middle line:84%
and give them the proper
instruction, the people that

00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:26.060 align:middle line:84%
get their behaviors to
match their intentions

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and their actions
equal to the thoughts,

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.961 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have some
type of new experience

00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:31.220 align:middle line:90%
or transformation.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So then the transformation
then that we've

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.010 align:middle line:84%
measured over the years
gives me more information

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to teach transformation
the next time.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: So now we've just got
it down to a little bit more

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.050 align:middle line:90%
of a science.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So that first day,
look, I've looked

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
at enough brain
scans in real-time,

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and I know this now, that
when you analyze your life

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:84%
within some disturbing
emotion, you're

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.670 align:middle line:84%
going to make your brain
worse, because you're

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
thinking in the past.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.900 align:middle line:84%
When you get that person
beyond their analytical mind

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and beyond those
emotions, they're free.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They'll have the answer,
because they're outside the box.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Now they're free to see it
from a different perspective.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.916 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that we're actually

00:51:08.916 --> 00:51:12.930 align:middle line:84%
accessing different dimensions,
like the fifth dimension?

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Wow.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.691 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have
enough time for that.

00:51:15.691 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you leave this
three-dimensional reality,

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.970 align:middle line:84%
the fourth-dimensional
reality is time, right?

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:26.984 align:middle line:84%
And when you're somebody as
someone with something living

00:51:26.984 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and in
some time, you're

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:84%
your personality trapped in
three-dimensional reality.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.281 align:middle line:84%
You've got to play by the rules
of three-dimensional reality,

00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Newtonian physics.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The moment you become nobody,
no one, no thing, nowhere,

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and no time, that's the moment
you become pure consciousness.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're disinvesting all
your attention and energy

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.143 align:middle line:84%
out of this
three-dimensional reality.

00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is the
bridge to the quantum.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So then when you
start paying attention

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.299 align:middle line:84%
to that energy,
that information,

00:51:52.299 --> 00:51:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and you start connecting to
greater and greater degrees

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:84%
of oneness and wholeness, and
you become the consciousness

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of everybody, everyone,
everything, everywhere,

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and every time, now you're
entering that fifth dimension

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.820 align:middle line:84%
where there are multiple,
multiple realities that you get

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.270 align:middle line:90%
to experience simultaneously.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the mystical.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the end part
of our workshops,

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that Saturday and Sunday where
we explain the secret elixirs

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of the pineal gland and how
to activate that little radio

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.640 align:middle line:84%
receiver in the
back of your brain

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that picks up information,
what happens when

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the metabolites are released
from the derivatives

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of melatonin that switch
on different systems.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start to
experience more of yourself.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Not the self called
Lisa, the very big Lisa

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that has this connection
to so many different realms

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:90%
and possibilities.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:45.315 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: And again, you can't
come back as the same person.

00:52:45.315 --> 00:52:46.500 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just did it.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You just showed us all that,
and just a little piece.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- that's a brilliant
way of describing mystics,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.710 align:middle line:84%
because they spend so
much time in that place

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.130 align:middle line:90%
of that fifth dimension.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:05.177 align:middle line:84%
They're rarely in the
first, second, and third.

00:53:05.177 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: It's really
interesting, because when

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.600 align:middle line:84%
you create from
three-dimensional reality,

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.400 align:middle line:90%
get ready.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.430 align:middle line:90%
It's going to take time.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're going to
create more of the same.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.045 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Well, not only that.

00:53:13.045 --> 00:53:15.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to create like
a vision, a dream of what you

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.090 align:middle line:84%
want, a new job, or whatever, a
new relationship, a new house,

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.815 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
you time to go get it,

00:53:20.815 --> 00:53:22.940 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to drag
your body through space.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.442 align:middle line:90%
And it takes time.

00:53:24.442 --> 00:53:26.150 align:middle line:84%
When you create from
the fifth dimension,

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.650 align:middle line:84%
you actually are
doing the opposite.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.842 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
collapsing space and time.

00:53:29.842 --> 00:53:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're drawing
the experience to you.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.545 align:middle line:90%
You don't go and get it.

00:53:33.545 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
When there's a vibrational match
with your energy and something

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:38.253 align:middle line:84%
in your future and you're
creating from the fifth,

00:53:38.253 --> 00:53:40.440 align:middle line:84%
you're not playing by
Newtonian physics any longer.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
You're playing by quantum,
which means now you

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.655 align:middle line:90%
are drawing your future to you.

00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:46.310 align:middle line:90%
You're a magnet to your destiny.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So things start showing up
in your life out of nowhere,

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
because you created
them from nowhere.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Something appears
out of nothing,

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.390 align:middle line:84%
because you created
it from nothing.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It happens in no time, because
you created it in no time.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're less
likely to go and get it.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely to tune
into it and bring it to you.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.785 align:middle line:84%
So now you're not rushing
anywhere to get it.

00:54:04.785 --> 00:54:07.159 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you understand
that there's a different way

00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm proud to say that
the people in our community

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that do this work,
they do it every day.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.050 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.639 align:middle line:90%
Because they see the magic.

00:54:16.639 --> 00:54:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
the magic to end.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's effortless.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: They don't wake
up and say, oh, god,

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I've got to create
my future today.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.626 align:middle line:90%
They're not like that.

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:23.910 align:middle line:90%
They're like, let's go.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:25.503 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: They're excited to do it.

00:54:25.503 --> 00:54:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And the enthusiasm is the
energy of creation, right?

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:29.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They attract it.

00:54:29.825 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So do you then, do
you watch the news?

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow what's happening?

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:36.694 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- that's definitely
a different frequency.

00:54:36.694 --> 00:54:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: I do watch the news,
because I want to be informed.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But for me personally,
I never focus on people.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I focus on principles.

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you focus
on a principle,

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:53.150 align:middle line:84%
you're less likely to put
it on a person or a thing.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.460 align:middle line:84%
When you focus on
principles, people

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.950 align:middle line:84%
can align with
principles, and no longer

00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:59.690 align:middle line:90%
be deceived by people or things.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I do watch it, because
I want to be informed.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I do think this is
a really incredible time

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to be alive, because a new
awareness, because of knowledge

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and information, creates
a new consciousness.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.890 align:middle line:84%
A new consciousness
creates a new energy.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And that new energy is
unraveling everything;

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.860 align:middle line:84%
politically, economically,
socially, religion, education,

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.740 align:middle line:84%
journalism, the
environment, medicine.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything's coming
apart, because it should.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:84%
We're way more powerful
than all of this.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And all those things have to
be exposed for people to really

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:37.352 align:middle line:84%
realize, oh, it's
always been within me.

00:55:37.352 --> 00:55:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always
ask my guests just

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:40.880 align:middle line:84%
to wrap up here,
your biggest why.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.050 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest reason
why you, Joe Dispenza,

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.230 align:middle line:90%
do what you do for humanity?

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Why not?

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's nothing
else I want to do.

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a great
job, and witnessing

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:59.330 align:middle line:84%
human transformation, and
being a part of transformation.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're wired to
care for one another.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.310 align:middle line:84%
We're wired to
serve one another.

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We're wired to truly
contribute to one another.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:10.460 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:15.350 align:middle line:84%
All of this media and
television and war and politics,

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:19.430 align:middle line:84%
prejudices, all to create lack
of trust and separation, right?

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you witness that
kind of transformation,

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.460 align:middle line:84%
all the lost luggage, all
the missed flights, all

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the late flights, all the
challenges we have, none of it

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:33.410 align:middle line:84%
matters for that one person
who stands up and says,

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.520 align:middle line:90%
my tumor is gone.

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.260 align:middle line:84%
To me, I changed
somebody's future.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And that person is going to
change other people's future.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.600 align:middle line:84%
One friend of mine
said the other day,

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:84%
who had brain cancer, that just
got a clean bill of health,

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.300 align:middle line:90%
a West Point graduate.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:90%
She went to her doctor.

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what her
doctor said to her?

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.440 align:middle line:10%
Now I remember why I got into
medicine in the first place.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.300 align:middle line:84%
She changed his life
just by saying--

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.684 align:middle line:90%
and he pronounced her--

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.350 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't going to
make it a few times,

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and she never gave up.

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great reason.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE: He said, I am so
happy to tell you this.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:90%
So happy.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:15.632 align:middle line:84%
So you never know what
you do in choosing

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to believe in this
stuff who you're going

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.930 align:middle line:90%
to affect in some future time.

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
creates community,

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of emergence
of people that share

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the same energy, the same
beliefs, the same thoughts,

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.402 align:middle line:90%
the same behaviors.

00:57:28.402 --> 00:57:29.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a new community.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And you don't try to
fix what's broken.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:34.280 align:middle line:90%
You create something better.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And everybody leaves
there and goes to there.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.364 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I just want
to contribute in some way

00:57:39.364 --> 00:57:40.280 align:middle line:90%
and make a difference.

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's what it
means to become supernatural.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
name of your book.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's obviously what
you're teaching us.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we could all be in this
field of becoming supernatural,

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.350 align:middle line:84%
what a beautiful
place we would be in.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: It's a start.

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:57.626 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Joe.

00:57:57.626 --> 00:57:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: You're welcome.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a true
pleasure to have you here.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE: Thank you.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.729 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And if you would like
to watch any of my other shows

00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:05.650 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Joe Dispenza, just
go to "Inspirations" on Gaia.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:06.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.510 align:middle line:10%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay aware.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:20.246 align:middle line:90%
