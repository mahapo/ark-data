00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I recently saw a movie
called "The Immortalists"

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:84%
about two eccentric
scientists struggling

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:84%
to discover medical
breakthroughs to create

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.905 align:middle line:90%
eternal youth.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The movie documents a
fascinating community

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
of scientists who look at the
aging process as a disease.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Joining me are the filmmakers
Jason Sussberg and David

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Alvarado to talk about
how the film got made

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.529 align:middle line:84%
and why someone would
want to live forever.

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:38.945 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, thank you
for being here.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ALVARADO:
Happy to be here.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.961 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON SUSSBERG: Thanks.

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:43.709 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what attracted you
to the topic of anti-aging

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
David, I'll start with you.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well,
Jason and I are

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
both really
interested in science.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I We always have been.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we started to
figure out what kind of film

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
we could make, we learned about
this very interesting community

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of scientists who
looked at aging

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.595 align:middle line:84%
not as a thing that's natural
and should be expected

00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and should be
desired, but instead

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
as a disease that
could be, in principle,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:90%
stopped and maybe even reversed.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you mean
the unhelpful aspects

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
of getting old where
degenerative disease happens

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
or just the accelerated
years being the disease?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well, right
now, as human beings,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
the more years we live, the
more our bodies fall apart.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Break down, yeah.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: And so
their idea would

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
be time would
still move forward,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
but obviously, you
don't get older anymore.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So you would still be collecting
years of wisdom and experience,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.199 align:middle line:84%
but you just wouldn't be
falling apart as you did that.

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
how long did it take

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:90%
you to make the film, Jason?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah, we
began pre-production

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
in the fall of
2010, and we didn't

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:90%
premier until March of 2014.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:90%
So it was a long road.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It was about three
years total from when

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
we started to when we
actually printed off the DCP

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:90%
and sent it to the festivals.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We did about a year of
pre-production, a year

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and a half of production, and
that's built into the edit.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.175 align:middle line:84%
We were sort of
editing the whole time.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I
was going to say,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.133 align:middle line:84%
when you get into
something like this,

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.223 align:middle line:84%
is it a discovery
process along the way?

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
Because you really can't
script something like this.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
such an unknown when

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.882 align:middle line:84%
it goes into this whole world
we don't even know about.

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
In the film, we were interested
in the whole community

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of scientists who are
trying to do this task.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But really, we
found out much later

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
after starting production, that
we were fascinated with two

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.530 align:middle line:84%
of them, just two
guys that are obsessed

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
with this goal of
trying to live forever.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.169 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to
understand what motivated

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
them to do that,
why they dedicated

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:90%
their entire lives to it.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
These guys don't have children,
they have a very small family,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
their whole life
is just absolutely

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.505 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to this thing that
seems entirely impossible.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Either that or the CIA.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Right.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they
specifically have this,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and they go to extremes
to prove the fact that we

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:90%
can live forever.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:90%
And the science is out there.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So Bill Andrews, let's talk
about him for a second.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.389 align:middle line:90%
How did you meet Bill?

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well,
Bill is interesting

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because we had already been
talking to other scientists.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he contacted
us, saying he

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
ran this huge telomere
research facility.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
He said telomeres are the way
of the future for age reversing.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't sure what to
make about that when we first

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
talked to him.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But Jason and I went
down and visited

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.366 align:middle line:84%
his labs, Sierra
Sciences, in Reno.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
once we met him,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
we said this guy is
very interesting.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:90%
He's compelling.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
He's completely
dedicated to the task

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.834 align:middle line:84%
and almost just absolutely
obsessed with it.

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hyper-focused.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Yeah.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he's
an ultramarathoner

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
who runs 100-mile races a week.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:90%
A week, right?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.521 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's right.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he's got to have some
secret to youth there in order

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.475 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate as
fast as he does.

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Did you know in
the beginning you

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
going to run with him

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
in a race in the Himalayas?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I love the movie,
that it took us there.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But was this something that
you had planned for in advance?

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah, we knew
the history of Bill's race.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Because in the story,
Bill tries to do the race,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and then he ends
being airlifted out.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:90%
This was in 2011.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.473 align:middle line:84%
He goes back in 2012
to try to finish

00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:16.514 align:middle line:90%
the race that he started.

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
happened during the time

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:90%
you were doing the film?

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.178 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The first race when
he got injured,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
we were not making
the move by then.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
When we came on board-- it
was actually 2010, sorry--

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but when we came on
board to do the film,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
he was going back to the
Himalayas to slay this dragon,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
vanquish this foe that
he was unable to finish

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:90%
the first time.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.299 align:middle line:84%
So we were aware of it
in the back of our minds.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We also really wanted to
focus on that aspect of life

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
because it is,
metaphorically speaking,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
he's running against
the ultimate clock.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.604 align:middle line:84%
He's competing against
death and also competing

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
against his own aging.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So we really like the idea of
the marathon being this analogy

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
that we could latch onto.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So we just didn't know what race
we were going to film with him.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we heard of this mythic
race that was in the Himalayas,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's 18,000 feet
above sea level.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's got the highest
motorable pass--

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.655 align:middle line:84%
meaning that cars can actually
go over-- which is essentially

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
a base camp for Mount Everest,
which is 18,000 feet high.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's multiple days,
it's over 24 hours,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%
and it's 138 miles.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To run?

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: To run, yes.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Straight, without
sleeping, without anything.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
He was eating while
he was running.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He only stopped to
fix his blisters.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
moment where he almost

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:90%
doesn't come back to the race.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But we knew we were going to
focus on one of the races.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't know it
was going to be that one.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.463 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: And keep in
mind that Bill at the time

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:50.597 align:middle line:90%
was 62 years old.

00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.888 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:05:51.888 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So he's well into
the anti-aging.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But he says so
clearly in the film

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that we are so close to
finding the eternal youth

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
serum, essentially,
which he is convinced of.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
After all the research that
you did and from drilling

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.014 align:middle line:84%
into this scientific community,
do you feel that we're close?

00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: I think it's
our job as filmmakers

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to present a compelling story to
entertain people along the way

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and let the scientists
speak for themselves.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't have degree in science
news David worth enthusiasts

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
so I think it's up to the viewer
to really listen to these guys

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and do their own research.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
science is out there,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's super compelling.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.594 align:middle line:84%
And if nothing else,
it tells a great story.

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at a trailer

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
of the film "The Immortalists."

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.649 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL ANDREWS: Hundreds
of years from now,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look
back and be shocked

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
about this horrible
world that we all

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
used to live in where people
used to get old and die.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.187 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUBREY DE GREY:
We're interested not

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
in slowing aging down but
in actually reversing it,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
turning back the
biological clock.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.725 align:middle line:90%
This is not science fiction.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:10.808 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Even if I bring forward the
defeat of aging by just one

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.576 align:middle line:84%
day, you know, that's
100,000 lives that I'll save.

00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just astronomical.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Harvard
has actually been

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
able to reverse
aging in mice using

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:90%
telomere-lengthening technology.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: Once we are really
truly repairing things as fast

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
as they go wrong, game over.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We will have the ability
to live indefinitely.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Curing
aging is a race.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.742 align:middle line:90%
The clock ticks once.

00:07:43.742 --> 00:07:46.182 align:middle line:90%
The telomerase pushes it back.

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:47.158 align:middle line:90%
It ticks again.

00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:49.598 align:middle line:90%
The telomerase pushes it back.

00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOLLY SHERIDAN: If
Bill gets to his goal,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:84%
then our marriage is
forever, and ever, and ever.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.972 align:middle line:90%
Think about that one.

00:07:56.972 --> 00:08:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: I can view myself
as a poster boy, so to speak.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be much less
difference between people

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.645 align:middle line:90%
of different chronological ages.

00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:11.266 align:middle line:84%
>>COLIN BLAKEMORE: This is snake
oil, and dangerous snake oil.

00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Dr. Andrews is simply
a more recent iteration

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of similar personalities
in the past.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.842 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I'm not surprised
that people don't believe us.

00:08:19.842 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BLAKEMORE: What I
really worry about is

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.075 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of a
sudden breakthrough,

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
of the bigger question
about humanity as a whole.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: If my mother
had been healthy enough

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to benefit from these
future therapies,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
then she would very
much have wanted to.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
She had definitely
not run out of things

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to do in
her life by any means.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: We are going to
find something soon enough

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to allow my 84-year-old father
to see his own aging reversed.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.635 align:middle line:84%
>>RALPH ANDREWS:
Life is so funny

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
because you learn,
and learn, and learn.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And just about the
time you've learned

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.982 align:middle line:84%
what you wanted
to learn, you die.

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:04.065 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: It sometimes
escapes the general public

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that scientists are
actually human beings.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.222 align:middle line:84%
They enjoy having a
good time as well.

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I really
don't know what

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:90%
does happen when a person dies.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.246 align:middle line:90%
I want a doctor.

00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:14.713 align:middle line:90%
There's no glory in dying.

00:09:14.713 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so did you
choose to segment this film

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
into certain portions in the
beginning, middle, and end?

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Was there a science part
and then a story part?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.502 align:middle line:84%
Did you choose to storyboard
it in a certain way?

00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DE GREY: One of you.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah, sure.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So we actually spent
a great deal of time

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about structure,
how we were actually

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
going to put this
thing together.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So we knew we had two characters
by the time we were actually

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in the edit room.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
At one point, we had many,
many more characters.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But after we whittled
it down to two,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:84%
it became a really easy
way to edit the film.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we would have
a seen with Aubrey,

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
have a scene with Bill,
introduce, perhaps,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:90%
a new character.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But we were really focused on
telling their personal lives.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So it was not just the science,
but who they were with,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
what partnerships they had,
who were the scientists who

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.026 align:middle line:84%
agreed with them, who
were the scientists that

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:90%
disagreed with them.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, we spent a lot of time.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We were trained, as
documentary filmmakers,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to these
stories and not to make it

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
just merely a talking
head experience,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
but to make it a story that
had a beginning, a middle,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and an end.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stories tell.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:90%
They explain so much.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything is based
on storytelling.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.554 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient art form of
explanation and learning.

00:10:44.554 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: It's true.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I think
that was a good choice.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You could see any
documentary on the science,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and talking heads,
and ficus trees.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But you did a good job of really
giving through the story there.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So Aubrey, how did you guys
meet and come across Aubrey?

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.329 align:middle line:90%
He's quite the character.

00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: He really is.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, Aubrey de Grey is one
of the more famous people

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
in the world of age
reversing and biogerontology.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
He stood out to us immediately
as an interesting character.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Not just his personality
and his science, but even

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:90%
the way he looks.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:90%
He has this long, red beard.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And he just has this charisma
that people are really

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
fascinated with.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it was obvious to
us that if he would give us

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to film
him, that would make sense.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And so after spending
a little time with him,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.385 align:middle line:84%
we realized this is really the
guy that can carry the story.

00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He also causes
a certain amount

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.614 align:middle line:90%
of agitation in the audience.

00:11:35.614 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Absolutely.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's got some
distinctive personality traits

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and perspectives on life
about polyamorous lifestyles

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:90%
and community living.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So how did you choose to exploit
that and also not discredit him

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.694 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well,
it's interesting

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
because we set out to create a
document of what we found when

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
we got access to
these people's lives.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we never filmed anything
that anybody didn't want us to.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when Aubrey started
to welcome us into his life,

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we found that he was
polyamorous and that he

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:90%
likes to drink a lot.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he's OK with
people knowing this about him.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he's
a very proud nudist.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
He enjoys spending time
with his wife in the woods

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
just absolutely in the nude.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a part of the
relationship that they have.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
discovered that, we

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
asked if they wouldn't
mind if we filmed it.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:90%
They allowed it.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that that
was important for people

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to understand, that behind
these brilliant minds

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
are these very interesting
personality traits

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that many of us might
conceive as odd.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it made a lot
of sense to show that.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it
makes perfect sense

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:90%
that he welcomed you into that.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And he explained his
life in a certain way.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:84%
But have people, in your
opinion, when they-- well,

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm going to have
the audience take a look.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.733 align:middle line:84%
Take a look and form
your own opinion.

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Here's a clip of Aubrey de Grey.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: I'm certainly
not inclined to get sick.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to get Alzheimer's
disease, or cancer, or any

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of the things that afflicts
people when they have

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the misfortune to have
been born a long time ago.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So I do not want to end
up in a place like this.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The concept that I developed
is all about the application

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
of regenerative medicine
to the problems of aging.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Aging is a process that
happens naturally in the body.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's all about damage--
molecular and cellular damage

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
that accumulates in
the body over time

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and eventually kills
us through the creation

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
of various diseases.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.418 align:middle line:84%
Molecular garbage,
really, in the cell.

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:59.429 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do
is fix the problem

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
by introducing new enzymes that
the human body doesn't have,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.939 align:middle line:84%
that are found in other
species, and that can break down

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:09.605 align:middle line:84%
the substances that
we can't break down.

00:14:09.605 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
same as the concept

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of keeping your house
reasonably free of garbage.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to take garbage out of
your house once a week or so.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If you take a month,
then the house

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.799 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work as
well as it used to.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
same in the human body.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Graveyards are
somewhat paradoxical.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They accumulate only
certain components

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of decomposed human
bodies, but not

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
molecules that accumulate
throughout life

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.185 align:middle line:84%
and eventually cause some of
the most important diseases

00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of old age, such as
cardiovascular disease

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and macular degeneration.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they don't
accumulate in graveyards

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
means that something in the
soil is breaking them down

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
even though nothing in the
human body can break them down.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, we
might be able to identify

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria which are able
to break these things down.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we might be able to
identify the genes and enzymes

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.169 align:middle line:90%
that they use.

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Once we get to a point of
sufficient comprehensiveness

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of the maintenance, where we are
really, truly repairing things

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
as fast as they go
wrong, game over.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
We will have the ability
to live indefinitely.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what Aubrey
says makes so much sense

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.677 align:middle line:84%
about clearing the
garbage out of the cells.

00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually
the one, ultimately,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that got the funding in terms
of his scientific discoveries.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:90%
So he's a brilliant scientist.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But have you surveyed the
audiences after the show?

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Have people liked or
disliked his character?

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Do they find him abrasive
or do they talk more

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:90%
about the science?

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.771 align:middle line:84%
What's the feedback
been from the audience?

00:16:13.771 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well, I
think Jason and I both

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
have found that the feedback is
different all over the place.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
We've shown the film in
London, and Moscow, and Canada,

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and just all over the world.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's always different.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
We like to get a show of hands.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
If you could take this kind of
technology, would you do it?

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And on the counter end,
this is the worst idea ever.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so interesting
to see the different responses.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, the most fun
part of showing the film

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is talking to people
afterwards and hearing

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.871 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of conversations that
the film begets in the crowd.

00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
biggest response?

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Yea or nay?

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Well, I think
it depends on where you are.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, everybody in
Canada wants to live forever.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Almost unanimously,
those hands go up.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
In LA, it was pretty high up.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
We've been in Wisconsin
where it was really low.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.375 align:middle line:84%
People mostly thought that
was the worst idea ever.

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:90%
It's been completely mixed.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.817 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Has most of
the nay response--

00:17:09.817 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
not that it was
negative, but no, they

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't want to
live forever-- is

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that mostly associated
with ethical perspectives

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
on over population, and
religious views, and so forth?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: I'd say
it's across the board.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
People have very valid concerns
about the overpopulation

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:84%
control, the carrying
capacity of the planet.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we've created
our whole culture and family

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.002 align:middle line:84%
structures around the idea that
eventually, your grandparents

00:17:36.002 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
are going to pass
away, and they're

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.043 align:middle line:84%
going to leave you
something, and then

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
you're in charge of the
family after that, and so on.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And so our psyches
and our traditions

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
have all been around
the simple idea

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're all supposed
to die eventually.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: So there's a lot
of concerns all over the place.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
If it were up to you guys,
would you choose to live forever

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.244 align:middle line:90%
or to die trying?

00:18:02.244 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: It's
a great question.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
It's hard not to think about.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
During the production
of the film,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
it was a conversation that
we were constantly fielding,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and also something that was
a big topic of concern when

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
we were doing the project.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:90%
At the time, I turned 30.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I got married.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:90%
David turned 30.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So aging was something
that was always

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in the background of our minds.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I think Aubrey says
it best when he

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
says he doesn't want to
get heart disease, cancer,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, anything

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that is age-related ill health.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
I think everybody

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
would agree that avoiding
age-related ill health

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:90%
is a good thing.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.044 align:middle line:84%
But as David said, there's
many, many, many concerns

00:18:46.044 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
that go well beyond
whether or not

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
you personally want
that for yourself.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
There are societal concerns.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.511 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: And people
are living longer already.

00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:55.995 align:middle line:84%
There's what they call
the silver tsunami--

00:18:55.995 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
the baby boomers who are
now starting to retire,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
starting to depend on
government assistance,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and are getting less and less
healthy as they get older.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But they're living longer than
other generations before them.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a multifaceted problem,
and it's worth talking about.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.134 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't
answer my question.

00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Would
I personally do it?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.552 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:19:18.552 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
different question.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't say that and not
also answer the question, well,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
does everybody else
need to do it too?

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Because
how could you

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:84%
do it if you wouldn't want
everybody else to do it?

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, once everybody else does
it, then that's a huge problem.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to really be
out-living our children.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you would have
to give them the solution.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So would this type of
age reversal process

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%
be only for the elite?

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Would it be cost
prohibitive for the survival

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.884 align:middle line:84%
of those on the
lower economic scale?

00:19:50.884 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: I feel,
my personal opinion,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:84%
is that that's the most
realistic nightmare scenario,

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a wealthy
overclass of immortals types

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
people, and then a lower class
who are working and living

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
short lives, and
dying, and can't

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:90%
afford the medical technology.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But then framed in the real
world that we actually live in,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what it's like.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Wealthy people can
afford the best medicine.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:90%
The poorest people can't.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a
reason not to develop

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.064 align:middle line:90%
better and better medicine.

00:20:23.064 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So we actually live in the
world with the same types

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:90%
of problems.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just not as extreme.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way that we'd like
to think about the film too,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is that the film is about
this fantastical idea

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we
could live forever.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But it also touches on
these very real things

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
happening right now.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's a
microcosm of what's

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:84%
happening in society and
communities these days.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But the solution that Bill found
is actually very inexpensive.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just a supplement
that extends telomeres.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was through the
scientific discoveries

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
If you can extend the
telomeres, then you

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
can extend the lifespan.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that one wasn't-- but
I'm not quite sure about what

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.114 align:middle line:90%
Aubrey had discovered.

00:21:06.114 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Well, yes.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So Bill's discovery
is yet to be found.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
He's looking for
a pharmaceutical,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.860 align:middle line:84%
a small molecule that
will extend our telomeres

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
indefinitely, thereby, in
his opinion, reversing aging.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But the supplement-- that's
a plant extract-- actually

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
won't really go that
far in reversing aging.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it just barely
lengthens the telomeres.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
So he's still digging.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
He essentially partnered
with that person--

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the nutraceutical, not to be
confused with pharmaceutical--

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep
his funding going.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But he has even said that it's
not really doing very much.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a very slow amount.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Aubrey's solution is not a
silver bullet like Bill's.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
He wants to repair aging using
seven different mechanisms.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:90%
He calls it SENS.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And it probably be a confluence
of factors and therapies

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that all come together
to rejuvenate people.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot more
sophisticated and harder.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And Aubrey predicts that
even with sufficient funding,

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a 50-50
chance it could work.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot further
down the road.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.964 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really come up
with any particular therapy.

00:22:18.964 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anti-aging
medicine is one

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:84%
of the largest growing
health factors in industries,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in most communities, most
health-related communities.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:90%
There's anti-aging centers.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a huge amount
of books and so forth.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
People have changed
their entire practices

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:90%
to anti-aging practices.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a clip here of
one of the anti-aging centers

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:90%
with that Dr. Terry Grossman.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TERRY GROSSMAN: My
name is Terry Grossman.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm an anti-aging physician.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason people
come to this clinic

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.756 align:middle line:84%
is because they don't
ever want to die.

00:22:55.756 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So what's your
family history like?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: Well,
actually, there's

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.556 align:middle line:84%
not much I can
tell you about that

00:23:07.556 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:90%
because my family is so small.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any brothers,
or sisters, or kids.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And my father left my
mother before I was born.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing about him.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So basically, a
pretty healthy family.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: When
did you first find

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.495 align:middle line:84%
that you had plaque
in your arteries?

00:23:23.495 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Oh, I want to
say probably 25 years ago.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.086 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: So you were only 35?

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.419 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: That's pretty young
for plaque in your arteries.

00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I don't have
any other markers--

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: We've been
increasing our life expectancy

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:90%
steadily.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.802 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you
live for a year,

00:23:41.802 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
we're adding two
and a half months.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:84%
You live for a year, we're
adding two and a half months.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they're
going to touch.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.095 align:middle line:84%
But how about the point that you
live for a day, we add a day.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You live for a
day, we add a day.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.844 align:middle line:84%
You live for a
day, we add a day.

00:23:52.844 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the
horizon just keeps moving.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, particularly when
we solve the telomere problem,

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
we've, in effect, achieved
human immortality.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We could live long
enough to live forever

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
by passing over three bridges.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Bridge one essentially
is the medicine

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.645 align:middle line:84%
of today-- the medical
and lifestyle therapies

00:24:21.645 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that are available to keep
us as healthy as possible.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Things like diet, and exercise,
and stress management.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Bridge one will
take us to bridge

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
two, which largely is the
biotechnology revolution.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
In our clinic, we're
using stem cells

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that are found in
belly fat because those

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
are the only cells in the body
that actually have the capacity

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:90%
to repair.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And this will occur over
the next couple of decades

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and take us to the mid
2030s, in which time

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:84%
bridge three-- the nanotech
revolution-- will take hold.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
The hallmark of the
nanotech revolution

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
will be the advent of
devices such as nanobots.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
The nanobots will detect
problems and repair them.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about life
expectancies measured

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:90%
in centuries.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so you have
a certain responsibility

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
as journalists and filmmakers
to present the opposing factor.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So Aubrey de Grey says that
Bill's method is actually

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:90%
going to cause cancer.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Why did you put that
particular part in

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.544 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
completely debatable?

00:25:48.544 --> 00:25:49.847 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Go ahead.

00:25:49.847 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sorry.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.346 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: It's fine.

00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny because
Jason and I don't really

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.269 align:middle line:84%
fully see ourselves
as journalists.

00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:84%
For us, we came to the
story not because we

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.867 align:middle line:84%
wanted to report on this,
so much as we wanted

00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to tell a story about these
interesting people who

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:90%
are doing something.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.811 align:middle line:84%
And we don't quite understand
what they're doing,

00:26:06.811 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:90%
so we wanted to know more.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And once we started to
ask the questions about,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
is their science real?

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And if it was real, would
that even be desirable?

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.707 align:middle line:84%
That's when we wanted to
see the other people who

00:26:17.707 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
were in their lives who
disagreed with them,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and then to present
those people as well.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.412 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
just an exercise

00:26:23.412 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:90%
of our own personal interest.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Who disagrees with these guys?

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And why do they?

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And are those
arguments just as valid

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
as the ones that they
seem to be making?

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And good journalist
are storytellers as well.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, in a way.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Why did you decide to have
the anti-cancer and the cancer

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:90%
causing aspects in the film?

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Well, that has yet
to be determined what is true.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So Aubrey suggests
that if we figure out

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
a way to shorten telomeres,
to delete the gene that

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
causes telomerase, that
would prevent cancers

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
from being caused.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Bill has the exact
opposite belief.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
He believes that if we
lengthen the telomeres in all

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of our cells, that
will help fight cancer.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
These are just
proof of concepts.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to actually know
until we actually do studies,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
test them on animals, and
let the science report back

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to the scientific community
over what is the right approach.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Science is a funny thing.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want to refute
science, run the experiments,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
rewind them, and put
forth a different theory.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it should
either check out or not.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's nice to
have a little conversation

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
between the two of them over
what theories they think,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
but right now, it's
really up to them

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.981 align:middle line:90%
to put the proof in the pudding.

00:27:38.981 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Has the
scientific community

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.172 align:middle line:84%
given you any
feedback on the film?

00:27:42.172 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Yes, they
all say there's not

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
enough science, which
is probably true.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But we do really enjoy the
fact that the film gets people

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to look into the
science themselves,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to ask questions themselves, to
have debates amongst themselves

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.531 align:middle line:84%
about the philosophy
and everything else.

00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's been very rewarding.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have
blogs and online chats

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth
about the movie?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that set up?

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.201 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: We do have a
blog on theimmortalists.com.

00:28:07.201 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
People can look at
some updates from what

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
the film is doing,
where it's showing,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.804 align:middle line:84%
and what people are
saying about the film.

00:28:12.804 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they can see
this in independent theaters

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
They just need to look
it up and find out

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
where it's showing
around their area, right?

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's correct.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not on DVD release
or anything at this point?

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.963 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Not yet.

00:28:21.963 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Other than Gaiam
TV, which is fantastic.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's another whole
opposing perspective

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that's presented in the
film in Aubrey's hometown.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And he is brought in front
of a review board there.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.294 align:middle line:84%
Did that come up by chance
when you were filming?

00:28:38.294 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Mhm.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.897 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
Oxford, England,

00:28:41.897 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and actually, Aubrey's
from Cambridge.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And so he's invited to a debate.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And they had a long legacy of
doing these scientific debates

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
at Oxford.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.422 align:middle line:84%
And so on the one
hand, we have Aubrey

00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
saying that we should
live as long as possible,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and we should do
everything to defeat aging.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there's
Dr. Colin Blakemore

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:84%
who says that it's neither
desirable nor is it feasible.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And we did not
actually set that up.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:90%
That was happening organically.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed us to get into
the ethical, thornier issues,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and to let other sides present
their case that what Aubrey was

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
saying was not desirable
and was misguided.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
We actually learned about
that about three days

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.476 align:middle line:90%
before it happened.

00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:29.725 align:middle line:84%
Aubrey let us know that,
hey, this debate's happening.

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:31.696 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
gold for you guys.

00:29:31.696 --> 00:29:32.564 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:29:32.564 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
This might be great
for your film.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, we immediately
started producing it,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and we turned it
around really quick.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But that was
happening organically.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And we always wanted things
to happen in the film

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:90%
as they happened in real life.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.205 align:middle line:84%
We really kept a
gentle touch on it.

00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really want
to force anything

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.995 align:middle line:84%
to actually happen
other than what

00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:90%
was happening in real life.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the
timing of this.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.518 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you
take a look at this clip.

00:29:57.518 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And just pay attention to
the timing, and the music,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and the contemplation
that you allow

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
the audience to have
within this debate.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really great.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very well done.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: 85% to 95% of all
cancers produce telomerase.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
That has led a lot
of people to believe

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that telomerase is
the cause of cancer.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.487 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:30:26.487 --> 00:30:28.195 align:middle line:84%
The most direct thing
that causes cancers

00:30:28.195 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:90%
is the mutations.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to prevent these
mutations from occurring.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
causes of these mutations

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.525 align:middle line:90%
is short telomeres.

00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: Telomerase
in human beings

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
is expressed at very low
levels, only just enough

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to allow cells to get
along for a lifetime.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But cancers express high levels
of telomerase most of the time.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.654 align:middle line:84%
About 90% of cancers
express really high levels.

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Now look at this.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.177 align:middle line:90%
A low level of oxidative stress.

00:31:00.177 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DE GREY: OK.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.759 align:middle line:90%
And what was mine again?

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMAN: 232, I believe it was.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DE GREY: Better than normal.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Wow.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting slaughtered here.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: You're just
doing too much running.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.114 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:31:09.114 --> 00:31:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: What
Aubrey wants to do

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is destroy the telomerase
gene in all of our cells

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And that would then decrease
our chances of getting cancer.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: My approach
is to actually use

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.662 align:middle line:84%
telomere shortening as
an anticancer mechanism.

00:31:26.662 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It's called WILT.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:84%
That stands for
Whole-Body Interdiction

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
of Lengthening of Telomeres,
if you really want to know.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I conceded
that Aubrey beat me

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:90%
on the age scan test.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But then I said to
him, but let's see

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:84%
you do as well as I did
when you're 60 years old.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.177 align:middle line:84%
And he just looks at me and
says, I'm going to do better.

00:31:44.177 --> 00:31:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: I notice I'm just
getting a lot of reflection

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:90%
off the ceiling light.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just hard to see on this.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:90%
F, D, L, O, P, Z, D. OK.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And the next one--
oh, god almighty.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: So really, telomerase
does not cause cancer.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Cancer causes telomerase.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But if telomerase
makes a cell healthier,

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.059 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make a
cancer cell healthier too.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.008 align:middle line:90%
Go, Aubrey.

00:32:09.008 --> 00:32:09.508 align:middle line:90%
Go, Aubrey.

00:32:09.508 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: At this
point, we don't

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
know which of these
approaches is actually

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
promising in the long run.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And if it turns out
that telomerase is a bad thing,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:90%
that's really bad news for us.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no
way that we're ever

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to cure aging
unless we can figure out a way

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to prevent telomeres
from shortening.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so you chose to
focus on the stories of both

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
of these particular scientists,
very opposing stories.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Bill, who found finally
his lifelong love,

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and who's a really
perfect match for him.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the course of the
film, they got married, right?

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And you got to witness
that and be a part of that.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Did he know he was going to
marry her before the film?

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Or were you a part of
that process as well?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah, again, we like
to keep a very light footprint.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we told
Bill to get married.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:06.106 --> 00:33:06.605 align:middle line:90%
No pressure.

00:33:06.605 --> 00:33:07.604 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: No pressure.

00:33:07.604 --> 00:33:09.276 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Making a
documentary of my life.

00:33:09.276 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:90%
No pressure to get married.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But we learned on
the first day that we

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
met him this story of how he was
engaged five different times.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.222 align:middle line:84%
He decided not to
become married.

00:33:20.222 --> 00:33:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And then he told us about
his girlfriend Molly,

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:84%
who was amazing,
and how they planned

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:90%
to go back to the Himalayas.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So that seed was planted.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:90%
I think he may have known.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
was an engagement.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But Bill could have
backed out of that.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we went back
to the Himalayas with him.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, they were
planning this all along.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So we were vaguely aware
this was going to happen.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It was a two-person ceremony--
just the two of them,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.270 align:middle line:90%
and the monk Lama Sespel and us.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.516 align:middle line:84%
So we were witness
to their wedding.

00:33:50.516 --> 00:33:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they got a
permanent wedding video

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.961 align:middle line:84%
from you guys, which
is really nice.

00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Literally, we put
together a video for them just

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.032 align:middle line:90%
as a--

00:33:57.032 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, David was editing
on one of the off days

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and gave it to them
as a wedding gift.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And they cherish it.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very nice.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.834 align:middle line:84%
One of the listeners
at the screening

00:34:06.834 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
pointed out the
fact that they got

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.986 align:middle line:84%
married in a temple that
believes in reincarnation.

00:34:10.986 --> 00:34:11.986 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's true.

00:34:11.986 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they'd rather
not reincarnate.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather just
stay incarnate.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just stay
living forever.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And now Aubrey, in his
several different situations,

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:90%
his wife is a scientist.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And she was pretty
clearly not-- she

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
said this is not my scene to be
in a polyamorous relationship.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.900 align:middle line:84%
How do you really
display that information

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:40.389 align:middle line:84%
without being partial
to her opinion on it?

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah,
that was something

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that we certainly
wrestled with in the edit.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.837 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, as
David said, the film

00:34:47.837 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is a document of what we
learned over the course of four

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.590 align:middle line:84%
years of pre-production,
production, and editing.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So it would be unfair to release
the film with Aubrey being

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:84%
in this polyamorous
relationship without actually

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:90%
hearing from Adelaide.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I think people want to know
what does his wife think.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I think we did it in
a way that allowed

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:90%
her to have a final word.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And Aubrey sees himself as
having a futuristic lifestyle.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Part of his futuristic lifestyle
involves many partners.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Adelaide didn't feel that way.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, those were the
opinions of the characters.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.829 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really
our decision-making.

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It was up to the
characters, and this

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.578 align:middle line:90%
is the life they were living.

00:35:28.578 --> 00:35:31.829 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, and he said he's
the poster boy of anti-aging.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's right.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is he as sarcastic
as he appears in the film?

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to sit down with
him and get an interview,

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:84%
questions answered, was
just-- it was funny at times,

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:90%
frustrating at other times.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we really
enjoyed him as a person.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
He's fun, and smart, and just
incredibly engaging to talk to.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Has he seen the film?

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: He
has seen the film.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And has he
commented back to you guys?

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Or has he moved on?

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Yes.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:90%
He likes the film.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.210 align:middle line:90%
He hates the title.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
For him, actually, the
title "The Immortalists"

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of a
mischaracterization

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:90%
of what he's trying to do.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Because after all,
he's not trying

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:90%
to make anybody immortal.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he knows why
we made that decision,

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.362 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, I
think he'll benefit.

00:36:17.362 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've said
several times, it

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.410 align:middle line:84%
seems like a superhero complex,
that term "the immortalists."

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:90%
We are here to save the day.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
they're necessarily up to.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They're really up to
trying to sustain life

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy way, which
is more important.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a plan for
a second documentary?

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Has this sparked a
lot more conversations

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.192 align:middle line:84%
as to where you want
to go from here?

00:36:40.192 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:84%
David and I are
committed to doing films

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.950 align:middle line:84%
on science, and
technology, and big ideas.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.625 align:middle line:84%
And so after this film, we
are doing pre-production

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and research right now on a
couple of different topics.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't the
last film of ours.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll definitely keep on
producing stuff in the future.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.333 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what were
you doing before this?

00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Before this particular film?

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: We were in
graduate school together.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So we did a two-year
Master's of Fine Arts

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:90%
program at Stanford University.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And we did a lot of short films.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.290 align:middle line:84%
10-minute films about
science and other things.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Jason did a political film
and a short film about science

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And through watching each
other do our own films,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
we saw that we're interested
in the same ideas.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so sure enough,
we got together

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.512 align:middle line:84%
to make this film
once we graduated.

00:37:30.512 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, so this is
fresh out of graduate school.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's right.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've aired
it at film festivals,

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's received a lot of
accolade from film festivals.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah,
we went all over.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The film's been in, I think,
over 30 to 40-ish festivals

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
all across America, the world.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:84%
We've played in Moscow,
Ireland, the UK, Copenhagen,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.992 align:middle line:90%
It's really had an amazing run.

00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So we were really fortunate
and privileged too.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So across the
board, a great response.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Pretty good.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:84%
There are critics who think
that we are either overly

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:84%
enthusiastic about their
goals, and other critics

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.637 align:middle line:84%
who think that we are
degrading their goals.

00:38:12.637 --> 00:38:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But we'd like to think
that we're leaving it

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to the audience to
determine what they think

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:84%
about these guys
and who they are.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But overall, we've
been very happy

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with the critical review
of the film as a film.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give you a
lot of attention as well.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you take a
look at this particular clip,

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and again, you can
make your decision

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:84%
about this story
that's depicted here.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELAIDE CARPENTER:
Aubrey's expectation

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is for me to either
retire or have

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
some way of doing my
research in California.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.855 align:middle line:84%
And that just clearly
wouldn't work.

00:38:47.855 --> 00:38:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: Certainly,
the expectation

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of living a very long
time might very well

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:03.325 align:middle line:84%
lead to a reevaluation of the
value of permanent monogamy.

00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:07.256 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.256 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARPENTER: We're
still married.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.274 align:middle line:84%
We're still in love
with each other.

00:39:11.274 --> 00:39:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But he has to be
with other women.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:26.545 align:middle line:84%
His ideal, I think, would
be to have a situation where

00:39:26.545 --> 00:39:30.490 align:middle line:84%
all of his women lived
together, and he could just

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.650 align:middle line:90%
live with all of them.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just so-- it's
so not my scene.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: This is more or less
the beginning of the property.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:90%
That leads to the front.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
There's another way up on my
left that goes to the back.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.692 align:middle line:84%
And then here's the
main thing up the drive.

00:39:52.692 --> 00:39:53.275 align:middle line:90%
Quite a sight.

00:39:53.275 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.425 align:middle line:84%
I guess I can view myself as
something of a poster boy,

00:40:01.425 --> 00:40:05.255 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, for
future lifestyle.

00:40:05.255 --> 00:40:06.580 align:middle line:90%
So here's the amazing house.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe that in the
relatively near future when

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:22.290 align:middle line:84%
we've brought aging under very
considerable medical control,

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.960 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be much less
difference between people

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.924 align:middle line:90%
of different chronological ages.

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.226 align:middle line:84%
I have three
partners in my life,

00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and they are of
very different ages.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
My wife is 68, and my two
girlfriends are 45 and 24.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KIM: We started a community
built as an immortality

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:90%
and polyamorous haven.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And I feel lucky to
have found myself

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.655 align:middle line:84%
in the melting pot
of these two realms.

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:00.752 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.752 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: What an
amazing place this is.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.489 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take me a while
to stop pinching myself.

00:41:07.489 --> 00:41:08.455 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:41:08.455 --> 00:41:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Cheers, my love.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:84%
My ultimate goal on
the longevity mission

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:90%
is to become obsolete.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:84%
To do enough that there
are people out there who

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:84%
are better than me who,
therefore, will supplant me

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being really the
spearhead of this mission.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I will be very grateful
to have the opportunity

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to retreat into
glorious obscurity.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
that this is where

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.771 align:middle line:84%
I will be spending a lot
of that retreating time.

00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the film
"The Immortalists"

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
has qualified for the Academy
Award in terms of documentary.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:84%
How does that work, for
future documentarians here?

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you get a film to
qualify for the Academy's?

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: So in order
to qualify for an Oscar,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a
certain theatrical run.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's playing
in New York City

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
for a week, a certain
amount of times,

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.920 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of days.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.172 align:middle line:84%
And then play in Los Angeles
for those same parameters.

00:42:12.172 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have
to have a certain number

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of critical reviews, so
from the "New York Times,"

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and the "LA Times,"
"Village Voice."

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:84%
All these people have reviewed
the film, mostly positively.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And from that certain
level of success,

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
we've qualified as a potential
for the future documentary

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.637 align:middle line:90%
category.

00:42:29.637 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.909 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty much
a clear cut thing

00:42:32.909 --> 00:42:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that you have to fit into
certain qualifications.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: That's right.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you get the
distribution on the film?

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
into these theaters?

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.622 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to going
right to video.

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Sure.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we were
at film festivals,

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
we started to get approached
from different distributors who

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:84%
wanted to distribute the film
theatrically and otherwise.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam TV actually
came along and was

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.460 align:middle line:84%
very enthusiastic
about the film, thought

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that it would be a successful
product for people who

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:84%
were interested in health, and
longevity, and other things.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And so once we
talked to each other

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and realized that this
would be a good partnership,

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:90%
we signed off.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And now it's going really well.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're also helping
with the theatrical release

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.385 align:middle line:84%
and getting it across the
country, and so forth?

00:43:11.385 --> 00:43:13.135 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: That's
right, through Gaiam TV

00:43:13.135 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and another distributor
called Gathr,

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.610 align:middle line:84%
which is a great distributor
for small filmmakers like Jason

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and I.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.554 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:43:20.554 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can really create any
type of theatrical release

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:90%
through these companies.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And they assist you to do that
to get the information out

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.270 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the Q&A's and
so forth afterwards,

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.460 align:middle line:84%
do you always
encourage the audience

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.607 align:middle line:84%
to stick around and ask
questions, and so forth?

00:43:35.607 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah, if
we're there, typically,

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.920 align:middle line:84%
we'll always entertainment a Q&A
and have a lively discussion.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.032 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are the biggest
questions that you guys get?

00:43:44.032 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: The
biggest questions--

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:90%
it's always what about religion?

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You didn't mention religion.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:55.234 align:middle line:84%
Or can you add more
science next time?

00:43:55.234 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:90%
We're always happy to do it.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.941 align:middle line:84%
But then also, people
do want to know

00:43:57.941 --> 00:44:00.727 align:middle line:84%
if Jason and I are
willing to live longer.

00:44:00.727 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:84%
If that would be something
that we would do.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.124 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so
fun to talk about.

00:44:05.124 --> 00:44:06.040 align:middle line:90%
So we really enjoy it.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.956 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the average
age of the people that

00:44:07.956 --> 00:44:10.219 align:middle line:84%
come to see the movie,
are they older or younger?

00:44:10.219 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ALVARADO: I'd say
across the board.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.690 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.356 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSSBERG: Yeah,
it's across the board.

00:44:14.356 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it reflects folks
who go to film festivals.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
they're students.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're
young filmmakers

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:90%
who want to watch a documentary.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Other times, they're
just an older baby boomer

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
crowd because that's the crowd
that goes to film festivals.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.190 align:middle line:90%
So it is across the board.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think it depends
on the flavor of the city

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're playing and
what time we're playing.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.550 align:middle line:84%
11 o'clock in the
morning on Sunday

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be different
than 7 o'clock on Friday.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so are we going to
get an "Immortalists 2"?

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Or is the new middle
age going to be 90?

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:47.453 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: You know what?

00:44:47.453 --> 00:44:50.352 align:middle line:84%
We'll check in with Aubrey and
Bill when they're 90 years old.

00:44:50.352 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll consider
doing a sequel then.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.291 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: 190.

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Give it some time.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.623 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:44:54.623 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:90%
190.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Living to 1,000 and beyond.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:84%
You've brought about a lot of
great points here in your film.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
You did a great job of
explaining the story

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.919 align:middle line:84%
in a beginning, middle,
and end of a film

00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:09.834 align:middle line:84%
so that we can make our
own decisions from it.

00:45:09.834 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the quality
of a good documentary,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
so that it actually
causes transformation

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.820 align:middle line:84%
rather than doing the
transformation for you.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So it causes thought processes
and many different things.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate you being here.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUSSBERG: Thank you.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ALVARADO: Thanks.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.844 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you would like to
watch a replay of my interview

00:45:27.844 --> 00:45:30.170 align:middle line:84%
here with the filmmakers
of "The Immortalists,"

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:90%
you can go to gaiamtv.com.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:52.700 align:middle line:90%
