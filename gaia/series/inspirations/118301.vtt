00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi,
I'm Lisa Garr, host

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.109 align:middle line:84%
of "Gaia Inspirations." and
our topic for this series

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're taping here at
the Celebrate Your Life

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Conference in
Phoenix, Arizona is

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to explore the
meaning of "I am."

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken on a
beautiful energy of its own.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jean Houston
knows who she is.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:84%
She is the author
of over 30 books.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
She's a leader in the
human potential movement.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.926 align:middle line:84%
I think she might have
created it. [LAUGHS]

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And she spent over
50 years consulting

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
with heads of state and
indigenous villagers and US

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:90%
presidents.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And she is one of the most
highly respected teachers

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:90%
in the human development field.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.214 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
joining me again on Gaia.

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: Thank
you so much, Lisa.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We were just talking
about the meaning of "I am"

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and how it has taken on
kind of a life of its own.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It really has a beautiful,
deep energy to it,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:90%
those words, "I am."

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean
to you, "I am"?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, of course,
it was a self-definition

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:90%
of God in the Old Testament.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But you find it as a
recurrent form [SINGS]

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:90%
in many other world scriptures.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, it is
a core memory that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.255 align:middle line:84%
is both sound and purpose
and a kind of potency.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It is a potent
statement. [SINGS] I am.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
take off on it.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So it has its own special
private existence as well as

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
something that is a
universal statement.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have been
the I AM Fellowships.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many groups
that group around the word.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the ultimate
Western mantra, the "I am."

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is not
to make it selfish.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
"I'm this.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm that.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:90%
That "I'm."

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.314 align:middle line:90%
So I see it.

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's being used
in this conference a lot,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.099 align:middle line:90%
I gather.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've heard.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And I think it is
because when we talk about

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
celebrate your
life, the "I am" is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
the verbal epiphany of
the celebration of being

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
human and being alive in
this, the most critical time

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.827 align:middle line:84%
I often say other times in
history thought they were it.

00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:90%
They're wrong.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:90%
This is it when we grow or die.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
This is it when we
either evolve or perish.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the sheer assertion of
the I-am-ness the power of it,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of it, the fact
that it is part of-- well,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the final words in
Dante's Paradiso.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The love that moves the
sun and all the stars.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And it is carried by
the "I am" It is carried

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:90%
by the beingness of the cosmos.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:90%
The cosmos is "I am."

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we reflect it in our
biodegradable space-time suits

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.495 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Space, I call them.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, our containers.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
This time in history you speak
about, this critical time

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.045 align:middle line:84%
in history you say is
carried by the "I am."

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
How critical is this
particular time?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And where are we right
now, in consciousness?

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, we are having
a complete catharsis of all

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the old stuff and
the old paradigms

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and the old patterns
and belief structures.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a time
of dynamic recreation

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
because-- well, in the end of
the 19th, early 20th century,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:90%
two remarkable things happened.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
First, was the harvest of the
world's wisdom traditions,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.429 align:middle line:84%
the eastern and the indigenous,
et cetera, and going back

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, the discovery

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics, which shows
that everything essentially

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:90%
arises out of consciousness.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
the ground of being.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is the "I am."

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are wonderful
perturbations

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on the great sea
of consciousness.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
And also, at the same time,
the fact that 96% of reality

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is invisible.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%
There's only 4% is visible.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.572 align:middle line:84%
And since we are the
universe in miniature--

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
we don't just live
in the universe.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
The universe lives in us--
that means only 96% of us

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:90%
is visible.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:90%
So what's in it?

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
What's in it?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, goddedness, sheer
potency, evolutionary power,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
enormous freedom,
if we would take it,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the ability to understand, as
we know in quantum physics,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that time-- past,
present, future,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
are simultaneous
in a way that is

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
very hard for our arrow of
time notion to understand.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been experimenting
with this in shifting the past.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Nothing major.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just little things.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching people
today how to actually take

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
a fairly minor incident
that wasn't a very good one

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and be able to shift
it to such an extent

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
that essentially, you're
editing the mind of God.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
You are editing
the quantum field.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.252 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Going backwards in time.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, it
isn't going backwards

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.725 align:middle line:90%
because it's simultaneous.

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Give me an example.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.641 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.472 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: All right.

00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
This is simple,
but it's very good.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
My friend Peggy Rubin,
who works with me,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.942 align:middle line:84%
and she had parents who
were very, very unhappy when

00:05:31.942 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
they found out that they
were pregnant with her

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.316 align:middle line:84%
because they had
run out of money.

00:05:35.316 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It was the middle
of the Depression.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if
only for a minute

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
they could have felt joy
when my mother announced

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that she was pregnant
with another child,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
because it affected
her whole life.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So we did this process in which
the mother told the father,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have another child.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And he embraced her
and said, I'm so happy.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And the kids, the other
two older children,

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:90%
were also happy.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And she saw it so vividly
that when she saw her brother

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and sister for the first time
in 80 years, as it turned out,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:90%
they were so happy to see her.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And they welcomed her.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And the whole metier of the
usual relationship had changed.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I had just seen this
once or she had seen this once,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:90%
it would be just a coincidence.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it hundreds of times.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:90%
But belief structures reality.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And belief also structures
time and reality.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.355 align:middle line:84%
My own case, if you
have a moment this day.

00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, please.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.813 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: All right, I grew up
in show business, as you know.

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted
to play the piano.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:90%
But we were always moving.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I always had the
same stinking piece.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So here's Miss Sturgis
in Los Angeles.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
working on, dear?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
"A Little Glow Worm."
[HUMS] All right.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But then it'd be another
month or two before I

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
would get to another piano.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
working on, dear?

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Miss Fortin in New York.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Stinking little
glow worm. [HUMS] I

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.934 align:middle line:84%
could never get out
of the glow worm.

00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The glow worm.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.822 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So what if I
had taken up the violin?

00:07:13.822 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I could have
practiced on the train

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:90%
because we lived on the train.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.372 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You wouldn't
have needed a piano.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Following
the comedians.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I went in there, back.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And I remembered.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I remembered playing,
rehearsing, trying, practicing

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:90%
on the train, my violin.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
So then, I took lessons.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I took lessons.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.965 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher said,
you've studied before.

00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:43.532 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, sort of.

00:07:43.532 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.547 align:middle line:90%
Well, just sort of, not really.

00:07:47.547 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, you're too good.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%
You have the bowing technique.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Because
I had actually

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:90%
been practicing back then.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And I believed it.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So my memory of the
piano is very dim.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But my memory of playing
the violin is intense.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
within two months,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I was playing the
Pachelbel "Canon," which

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:90%
is unusual for somebody my age.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So it's
that kind of thing.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You can restructure memory.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is not simply, I
believe, a psychological power,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:90%
even though it's that, too.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that since
we are in a timeless

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
embrace with the
universe itself, it also

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:90%
a structural quantum power.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've had a glimpse of
that, when I had a near death

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
experience where
I experienced time

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously happening 15
years prior, 15 years before.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredible
quantum moment.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum teaches us
that the atom is mostly space.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And for many, many
years, we believed

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
that space was nothing.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But now, you're
filling that space

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
with these incredible thoughts
of being able to engage with it

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.249 align:middle line:90%
and dance with that space.

00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I think your new book
is about this, yes?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.025 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well,
the little one's

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
coming out, that
it is consciousness

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and that once we realize
that we are, as I said,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the universe, we
have access to many

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
of its powers, its capacities,
things that we never

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
thought we could do, the
manifestation of creating

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
the future, you see, ways
of turning possibility waves

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:90%
into probability waves.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So I've just been teaching
people how to do this.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's been quite
remarkable, how

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
to create what is called
in Buddhism a terma.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.417 align:middle line:84%
And that was a term
that doesn't mean term.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a Buddhist phrase.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And Padmasambhava, back
in the Eighth century--

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
he's the man who brought
Buddhism to Tibet.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
He and his wife began
to plant termas--

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
it's called hidden treasures--
into the past, into the future,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.886 align:middle line:90%
in people's minds, in nature.

00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been teaching people
how to actually create a terma.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
That's a powerful intention,
a powerful intention

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that is not just for your
betterment, but for the world.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.617 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's physical?

00:10:12.617 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not physical, but it's--

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.325 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It's
felt. It becomes.

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you call it into being.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And then to take
this mind thought

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that is just potent with
potential manifestation,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.279 align:middle line:90%
plant it somewhere in your past.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And we do it again.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Plant it in the
future, your mind.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And we find things
start to happen,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
sometimes instantaneously.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday, I did one.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I was doing it at
Deepak Chopra's place.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And the terma, again,
it realized itself

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
within five minutes.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And other times, it's
sometimes a few seconds.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it takes a month.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was it that
happened in five minutes?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: >>Well, for example,
what I'm thinking about is

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
a woman planted a terma that
she would get at least 100 acres

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
of land in a particular part.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It was in New York.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And she would be able to
develop a very benign center,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.575 align:middle line:90%
a creative center for elders.

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And the person next
to her, who they

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
didn't know each
other well at all,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
was actually planting
a terma that you'll

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
be able to do something
creative with elders.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about it when they were--

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out
that one said, well,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
here's my 100 acres I have.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.936 align:middle line:84%
And the other says, well, come
join me in this expression.

00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was within
five minutes.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Within five.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.541 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But I
see it all the time.

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:90%
I am not promising five minutes.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But I am saying that the termas
are things that we feel them

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
substantially, we put them
as the hidden treasures

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
in our life, and then the
possibility waves begin

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
to weave in our reality.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reality begins to
arise into the manifestation.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have been
an advocate of what

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:90%
is possible for so many years.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I should say.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, for example,
we talk about my age.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.497 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is amazing to me.

00:12:05.497 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: This is
embarrassing, but--

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I have to just ask you.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You shared with me before the
show that you are almost 80.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: That's right.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.989 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I cannot believe this.

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: 78.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 78, OK, 78.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:90%
How do you maintain this?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your state
that you're in?

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, you know,
there's no reason externally

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.291 align:middle line:84%
that I should maintain
it because I've

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
traveled a quarter of a
million miles this year.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I've worked all over the world.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I work in sometimes
very difficult places

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:84%
in human development, human
capacity, social change.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And often, I don't
get much sleep.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I eat whatever is
put in front of me.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
My exercise is running
in the airports

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:90%
carrying very heavy bags.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is, I believe it.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially
a kind of terma.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a long-term
terma, if you will.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm also half Sicilian.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.582 align:middle line:84%
So that's 4,000
years of olive oil.

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Genetics,
oh, that's great.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But a
lot of it has to do

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:84%
with the relationship
to spiritual realities

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
would be the nicest
way of putting it.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual realities
that I believe

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
sustain and rejuvenate
and keep me going

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:90%
to do my work in the world.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is a passion
for the possible.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And the passion is
to be of real use.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so any time I really begin
to realize that I'm going down,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I just go back into
this sense of joyous--

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
a sense of joyous
contribution and living,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and that joy and
that radical empathy

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that I feel for almost everybody
and everything, and that sense

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.312 align:middle line:84%
of possibility, and
I just get renewed.

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is
the terma that you've

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.021 align:middle line:90%
placed inside your mind.

00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:51.853 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: In a way.

00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even before I understood
the terma experience,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I realize I've been doing
that for a long time.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you just recall
that constantly rejuvenating,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
constantly rejuvenating.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.596 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah.

00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually been tested,
full tests of my real age.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's decades
younger than I am.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My goodness,
fascinating.

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.935 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want you
to take a look here

00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
at Jean Houston talking
about how peace is sexy.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.524 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK VICTOR
HANSEN: The lady I'm

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
about to introduce you to has
got the most eclectic wisdom,

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
as far as I'm concerned,
on the planet.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:84%
She inspired me since the
first time I ever heard her.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
She wows my soul with her comedy
because her dad, Jack Houston,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
was the head comedy writer
for Bob Hope for 35 years.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:90%
She is a prolific trainer.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
She was trained by
Teilhard de Chardin.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
When she was a young kid
walking through Central Park

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and she came home
and her dad said,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
who were you with that
is telling you all

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:90%
this stuff about the noosphere?

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
She had Margaret
Mead live with her.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
She trained and has studied
the 20 top minds of our time.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
She has helped Hillary
Clinton write her book,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:90%
"It Takes a Village."

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
She is an active
consultant to 35 leaders

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:90%
of countries around the world.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
She has known everybody
from Eleanor Roosevelt

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
on to literally the who's who
and who's through of the world.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
She is about to wow your
soul and make your life grow

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
in every good way
because she teaches how

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:90%
to have expanded possibilities.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.333 align:middle line:84%
Would you please welcome my
great friend, Dr. Jean Houston,

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:17.832 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:15:17.832 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
She wowed everybody
yesterday and had all of us

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.827 align:middle line:90%
grow at levels.

00:15:22.827 --> 00:15:25.062 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:15:25.062 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: You know, we are a
very fortunate group of people.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We really are because w we
have an extraordinary reason

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:84%
for being on Earth, in this
the most important time

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.816 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Other times thought
they were it.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:43.856 align:middle line:90%
They were wrong.

00:15:43.856 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The early years of
the new millennium.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Our job, our holy task,
our great privilege

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is to help to bring about
peace, peace that is so rich, so

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
full of flavor, that it
makes sense to make peace,

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
to shift the dangerous and
fearful war-embracing patterns

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
of century to offer a rich
and evocative alternative.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Many years ago, I
was on a late night program,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:90%
1, 2 o'clock.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if some of you are

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
going to be pushing
your books at 1

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.658 align:middle line:90%
and 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what
happens is after a while,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:90%
you fall asleep.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:90%
And your mouth keeps on going.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're stunned at what you
have found yourself saying.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
myself saying was

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that many of the images,
the concepts of peace

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that most of us grew up
with, is simply too tame.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.739 align:middle line:90%
Peace should be alluring.

00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:90%
It should be fascinating.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It should be challenging.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
In a word, I said,
peace should be sexy.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what did she mean
when you said, peace is sexy?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a way of reframing
things, Ms. Houston.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Well, it's vital.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not an insipid dove.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with color and juice
and passion and possibility.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And see, when it's
really interesting,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
it serves as a lure of becoming.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
Then we have somewhere to go.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Then we understand.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It is not a floating something.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
It needs that
passionate embodiment

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.873 align:middle line:84%
so that it serves as a
lure of your becoming.

00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can use those
types of quantum powers

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.934 align:middle line:84%
to place the possibility
of peace into the universe.

00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, to place it.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.348 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new
movement now that I'm

00:17:33.348 --> 00:17:36.237 align:middle line:84%
sure you've heard about
called subtle activism.

00:17:36.237 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about that?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no, do tell.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And it's about
people getting together

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and essentially
entering into states

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
of either deep meditation
or prayer or contemplation.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously this has
been done for a long time.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But with very specific
intentionality,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
intentionality in the building
up of peaceful structures

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
or structures that are
community enhancement,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:90%
so what I call social artistry.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's really quite
amazing, some of the things

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:90%
that are happening.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a brand new movement.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.517 align:middle line:84%
You'll end up obviously
talking to someone about it.

00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm excited
about i this, yes.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it's all about
taking this idea of what

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is potential, what is
possible, and bringing it

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.737 align:middle line:90%
into the quantum.

00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Into the quantum
and creating much more

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
of what we would call
a probability curve

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than what is called
a possibility curve.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.051 align:middle line:90%
We have at any moment--

00:18:32.051 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's the difference?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.174 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, possible
is, I'd like to do.

00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to do that.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I have that possibility.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.082 align:middle line:90%
Probability, whoa!

00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is our probable.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.456 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: This is probable.

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
You can taste it.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:90%
You can dance with it.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:90%
It is palpable.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
It's substantive.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And in
that, you are greatly

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
increasing the probability
curve from just a possibility.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This idea of the terma
that you're talking about

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.771 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
I've heard of this.

00:19:00.771 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very excited
about it because it really

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
does go with the
idea of the quantum.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I notice that you're adding
passion every time that you

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.167 align:middle line:90%
create this new ball of energy.

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had an
incident, you said,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:90%
just a year-and-a-half ago.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Around
that time, yes.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
not that long ago.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I'll tell
you the whole story.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
And you can cut it if you like.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So my friend
Peggy and I took a vacation.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:84%
She said, we can
eat through Italy.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Or we can go to the Galapagos.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's go
to the Galapagos.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like
to get recognized.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And I did get recognized.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And all these nice
people on the boat, as we

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:90%
went from island to island.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And maybe one guy recognized me.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
He winked.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was OK.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Then the second group came on.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And there were a lot of kids.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said to me,
so what do you do, Jean?

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why I said it.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:90%
The devil made me do it.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, I teach third grade.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Mary, come here.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:90%
She teaches third grade.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Bring Jimmy.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
He has ADD.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Bring Sally.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, I was
like one of those great pueblo

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Indian dolls with
all these children.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So they would say-- and
I get along very well

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:90%
with children and dogs.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So the kids said, hey, Jeannie,
let's go climb a lava crater.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Da-da-da-da.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And they got on the craters.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, they wore size one shoe.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I wear size 12.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Guess what happened?

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I didn't

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.936 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Boom!

00:20:26.936 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I went right through.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.846 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up pretty
bad, but not terrible.

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lava crater is sharp.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Well, never mind.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.431 align:middle line:90%
Let's not go into that.

00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So anyway,
then, hey, Jeannie,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:84%
let's climb that mountain and
find the blue footed boobies.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:90%
This is the Galapagos, you know.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Then coming down, I had to
jump over places and things

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to get down.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.258 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, it went on like that.

00:20:54.258 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
[SIGHS] And by the time I got
home, my knees were like this.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I really ripped myself up.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have time to have--

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Down time.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah, well
long down time and things.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, I'm going
to go the stem cell route.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So I called up Regenexx.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very famous stem
cell place in Colorado.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yeah, you can do it.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the Cayman
Islands because you can't

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:90%
have it done in the States.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:90%
They took out blood.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:90%
They took out bone marrow.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
They do whatever
they do with it.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Took two months because it has
to grow all the stem cells.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.406 align:middle line:84%
And I grew an
abundance of stem cells

00:21:34.406 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
so that they were
shocked that somebody

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:90%
my age could grow this many.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
But I grew them.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And then in February,
March of this year,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:90%
they injected them back in.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 80% better.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the little beings,
they just went, they said,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:90%
let's put more collagen here.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let's put a little more.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was just hoping that
there wasn't a maverick one that

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
said, hey, let's grow a nose.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A jokester.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.711 align:middle line:84%
So they take the stem cells
and they grow it in the lab.

00:22:04.711 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
them in your body?

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.501 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Put them in my body.

00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It's in
the Cayman Islands.

00:22:10.217 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:90%
There's other places, too.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.607 align:middle line:84%
And so, however, you must have
done something with your mind.

00:22:15.607 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, of course I did.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, all the time.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I really felt my knees.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I figured out, when was I at
my most athletic creatively.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was a time in my teens.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I recreated that memory
so that I actually felt

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.741 align:middle line:84%
the teenage legs when I was
very much of an athlete, that

00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
moving in.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I did do that.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did you have
any intention on the cells

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.327 align:middle line:90%
as they were growing.

00:22:45.327 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I
said, good for you.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like nice dogs.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
You're very smart.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.632 align:middle line:90%
No nose.

00:22:56.632 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They got it.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
She's a jokester
and a performer.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I understand your
sense of humor.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Well let's take a look
here at Jean with, I mean,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:84%
all of who she is talking here
and representing what it means

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:90%
to have the human potential.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: You know, I look out
at you, what I can see of you.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.435 align:middle line:84%
And you remind me of a
very important story.

00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:24.110 align:middle line:90%
That tells me a lot about you.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:28.557 align:middle line:84%
It seems that Mrs. Rosenberg
goes to her travel agent.

00:23:28.557 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
She says, listen, Darling.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.264 align:middle line:84%
This year I don't
want to go to Israel.

00:23:31.264 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go to
the South of France.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
This year I want to go see
the swami of the year, Swami

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Anandanandananda.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, Mrs. Rosenberg, you
don't-- you have to take five

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:90%
planes.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
a broken down bus.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go in a
yak cart over the Himalayas.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk
for three months.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.754 align:middle line:84%
And then you're on
line for two months.

00:23:51.754 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Book me already.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So she takes the five planes
and she ends up in Kathmandu.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And she gets on a
broken down bus.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And she finally
gets on the yak cart

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and helps push the yak
over the Himalayas.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And she walks for three months.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And she gets on
line for two months.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she's
there, first person

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to enter the cave of the
great Swami Anandanandananda.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.245 align:middle line:84%
And a little man, all in the
saffron, the little bindu

00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
says, you realize,
of course, you

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.198 align:middle line:84%
can have only three words
with the great Swami

00:24:28.198 --> 00:24:29.034 align:middle line:90%
Anandanandananda.

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Three words, darling.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:90%
She goes in.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And there he is, this
beautiful, beautiful man,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
his eyes rolled up in
samadhi and people chanting

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
on either side.
[IMITATES CHANTING] Incense.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And she leans over.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And she says to the great
spiritual master, Morris,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:90%
come home.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I tell you this story
because I look out

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.726 align:middle line:90%
and I have been meeting you.

00:24:56.726 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing all
these Morrises,

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
people who have had a very
different life from what

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%
was expected.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
How many Morrises are here?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Because, my friends,

Did you know that?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You are mything
links, especially

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%

transformational entertainment

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:90%
business.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
You are the living connection

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:84%
of all times and all
places and the playing out

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%

in everyday life.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, beneath the soil
of your everyday world lies

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the vast root system of what
was once and what could be.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And you have felt this.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.507 align:middle line:90%
You have felt this in your life.

00:25:43.507 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And raise your hands
if this is true of you.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
In every quest, you have
wandered with Perceval

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
in search of the Grail.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

You have followed the Yellow
Brick Road with Dorothy,

trying to get back to Kansas.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You have labored with Psyche
to be reunited with Eros.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You've meditated with
Buddha under the Bodhi

Tree, determined to
reach enlightenment.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:90%
How many of you?

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, look at all the hands.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I know, this is California.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.752 align:middle line:90%
You expect that.

Now story is the just through
which consciousness and culture

moves.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're living in the time
of the changing of the story.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We might call it emergence
through emergency.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as we talk
here, and who you're being

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is really about transformation.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
From the very beginning
of time you sat down here,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
we've been speaking
about transformation.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:90%
What in your mind do you see?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see
us going from here?

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
What transformational
event do you

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:84%
think needs to happen in order
to get beyond this crisis

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I think it is
people turning, first of all,

to a sense of
joyous anticipation.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
When I asked the luckiest
person that I have ever

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
known-- it was Margaret Mead,
the anthropologist-- Margaret,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anybody so lucky.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Why are you so lucky?

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, I am blessed.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, why are you so blessed?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.654 align:middle line:90%
Because I expect to be.

00:27:13.654 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And it really was
like-- and I'll

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
tell you a very funny story
you can feel free to cut out.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.311 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So she was like a
walking magnet for good things.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And so I remember,
we did a lot of work together.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I came along to
[INAUDIBLE] Alex,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
who was a beautiful,
beautiful young man, 24.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And he seemed to be so down.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the matter, Alex?

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm so deeply in love.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You are, Alex.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Who's the lucky girl?

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually
a full-grown woman.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's nice.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.955 align:middle line:84%
Well, was there a
difference in age?

00:27:46.955 --> 00:27:47.455 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:90%
How much?

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:90%
50 years.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
50 years.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Alex, who are you in love with.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Margaret Mead.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Alex, you're 24 years old.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I know, but I'm so in love.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.404 align:middle line:90%
So I go and I tell Margaret.

00:27:58.404 --> 00:28:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, Margaret, do you
realize that Alex is madly

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:90%
in love with you?

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:90%
And she said, of course he is.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.255 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is that?

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
She said, I am bread to them.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
They are wine to me.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But she literally lived in
a state of high expectancy.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, our problem now is that
with all the media-- not

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
your kind of media, but the
other kind-- people just

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:84%
have a reinforcement of one
darn awful thing after another.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And the negative imagery
has gotten to be a kind

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of terrible-- it's the mean gene
cycling-- Not the gene, but--

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need
a very large turn-on

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of another order
of expectation that

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
is not based on war, that is
based on cooperation, based

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.249 align:middle line:90%
on sharing.

00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, well, you've
got all these other groups

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
showing up that are just
creating terror and horror.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but you have to
have the other groups

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that not only match them,
but also who are celebrated,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:90%
far much greater ones.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.012 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm one of the
best travelled human beings

00:29:12.012 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:90%
who's ever lived.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Apparently.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I've worked
in 109 countries.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
There is sheer glory going
on all over the world.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And it appears maybe as
a kind of subtext here

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:90%
or page 49 of the paper.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And see, this is where you are.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, you are so important.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the most
important people around.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I really mean that
because you're giving

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.972 align:middle line:90%
the other side of the story.

00:29:37.972 --> 00:29:39.862 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
see your work out.

00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:41.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'll talk to
you about it later.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:42.069 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:42.069 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But really
getting out into China,

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:84%
getting into Asia,
getting in, because you've

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
got to tell the
other story so it

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
becomes part of what we call
the Weltanschauung, the world

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
view in the minds and the
hearts and the sheer frequency

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:90%
of belief in people.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that joy.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:90%
What is that joy?

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:90%
We only hear about the war.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We hear about that.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Where are the kids laughing?

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Where are the mothers loving?

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Where is that joy?

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.975 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I find
it literally everywhere.

00:30:11.975 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm behind the scenes
in my own very small way

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:90%
with the migrants.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've just come
from Europe and all.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of everything,
you see them sharing and loving

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and grateful.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're people.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.208 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, indeed.

00:30:30.208 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And the children, especially.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:90%
How exciting this is!

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:90%
But I find it everywhere.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the big things,
of course is, the rise

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of women to full partnership
with men in the whole domain

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:90%
of human affairs.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.251 align:middle line:90%
This is changing everything.

00:30:43.251 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably where
one of the big actions are.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
another little secret.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, women are doing a
great deal of the work.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But who's doing the real
work behind the work?

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Grandma!

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Women of a certain age are out
there challenging, scolding

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
the old institutions,
creating new ways of being,

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:90%
calling in the new programs.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They have the genius
of the follow through.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're not scared.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.691 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, true.

00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I mean,
post-menopausal zest

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:90%
is no mere metaphor.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is not.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It is not to be--

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: So I find it there.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And I find it in so many people.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a new surge of optimism.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
If we can just keep it going
and increase it, then my friend,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:84%
then we have the basis
of a new civilization.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I, for one, do
not believe that we're

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:90%
the only ones minding the store.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we are part of a
vast supportive ecology,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:90%
wherever and however.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
300 sextillion stars

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sextillion stars.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: No, 300 to the--
anyway, we 300 sextillion.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That's as many stars as
there are grains of sand.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And
out there, you can

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:84%
be assured, since
the universe is

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.417 align:middle line:84%
very prodigal with
its creation, we've

00:32:00.417 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of different
kinds of being.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we have that
vast support system.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes, what are
the archetype patterns?

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm very close to an
archetype, you know.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And those
archetypal structures

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
are probably part of the very
substance of the universe that

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:90%
are part of our support system.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether you call
them angels or God

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
or numinous borderline persons,
we are no longer consciously

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Well,

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.113 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is your
archetype that you mentioned.

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, mine, I was
born with because she showed up

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
before I was born.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And when my father
wanted to say, hey, Mary,

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.490 align:middle line:84%
we're in the middle
of the Depression.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the kid.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
You can have more children when
I get on "The Bob Hope Show."

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And my mother started
to have a dream.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:90%
The limo would come.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:90%
It would take her to the palace.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:84%
In the palace was this
lovely lady, long dress.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would dance
and sing and laugh.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the beautiful lady,
who she called Blue Dell,

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
would say, you know, Mary, you
really have to keep this baby.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a good baby.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I know, Blue Dell.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But my husband's after
me all the time, I think.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Never mind him.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep the baby.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, anytime my father
got after her, here

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:90%
comes the limo in the dream.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.202 align:middle line:90%
She goes to the palace.

00:33:17.202 --> 00:33:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And Blue Dell and
she would dance.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this went on until I
got out in the 27th, 28th week.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I was one of these
little tiny ones.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And in 1937, what was it?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.410 align:middle line:90%
An orange crate with a candle.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:90%
No, it was better than that.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, so to make
a very long story short,

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.544 align:middle line:84%
Blue Dell turned out to be
the archetype of Athena.

00:33:40.544 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't worship Athena.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.055 align:middle line:84%
Athena shows up, or the
different energy systems

00:33:47.055 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:90%
of Athena, Saraswati in India.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You find her in some of
the Indian creation myths.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
quality of being.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a quality of wisdom.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a quality of civilization.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is your
guide who you identify.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah, because I come
out of-- I'm half Sicilian.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Naturally I am in
the Greco-Roman form.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:84%
But this is not a
worship of Athena.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.639 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe in
God, which is everything.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But it is a kind of archetypal
structure, whether real or not

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any difference.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.770 align:middle line:84%
She is extraordinarily
present and useful to me.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The goddess and
the priestess energy

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.225 align:middle line:84%
is very much a part
of who you are.

00:34:31.225 --> 00:34:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, it is.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're a
wonderful mentor to women.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And to men, as well, who
understand the goddess

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and embrace and
co-create with women.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.871 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely am--
I don't exclude men

00:34:43.871 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in the conversations
because they're part of it.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Did you ever read
Anne Baring's magnificent book,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.304 align:middle line:90%
The Dream of the Cosmos"?

00:34:51.304 --> 00:34:52.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I didn't.

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.762 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It's one of the most
important books of the last 50

00:34:54.762 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And it does deal with all
of these kinds of things.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I will
definitely read that.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Jean.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:90%
You are a blessing to humanity.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely love and
am honored to be with you.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: The honor is
all mine, I assure you.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you would like to
