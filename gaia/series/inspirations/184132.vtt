>>LISA GARR: Do you feel
that your memory is not

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:90%
as good as it used to be?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
Alzheimer's can begin decades

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:90%
before symptoms appear?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that you
can preserve and improve

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
your high-level thinking
skills by taking

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:90%
charge of your brain health.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But time is of the
essence, and joining

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
me is Dr. Ilene Naomi Rusk.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
She's trained as a
neuropsychologist

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and clinical neuroscientist,
and is the co-director

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and behavior
clinic where she developed

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
the Healthy Brain Program.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ILENE NAOMI RUSK:
Thank you so much.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.898 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me a
little bit about how

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
you got started with this,
way back before you started

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.265 align:middle line:90%
the Healthy Brain Program.

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Let me tell you a little
story of actually how I really

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:90%
got started.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was about 15 years old,
I had a very scary experience.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:10%
I was in a cabin in
northern Ontario,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:10%
and that cabin was
struck by lightning.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And I saw the walls sort of--

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
as close as you are to me right
now, I saw the wall come down.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was footing in
the water in this lake,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and I was shocked.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I was electrocuted.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And days after that, I had
very strange thoughts and--

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The wall came down?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Yeah, the
wall of the cabin,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:90%
I actually saw it come down.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
It was burnt and it came down.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was on a metal bed
and I got electrocuted.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It was super scary.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's traumatizing.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel--
I felt like I had

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
my first near-death
experience at that time.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it kind of an
out-of-body experience?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.885 align:middle line:84%
It was an out-of-body
experience.

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I felt at that moment,
and this is the key point,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
that I lost my mind
in that experience

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
because my brain must have
changed so much because

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:90%
of the electrical change.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So several days
went on and on and on,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:90%
and I was like [GASP].

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I was hallucinating.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I had visions and images.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:10%
It subsided, but I
remember, first of all,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:10%
thanking the universe.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:10%
The little that I knew about
the universe or divine power

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:10%
at that time, I knew that I
was kept on this side of life

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:10%
for a reason.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.632 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How old were you?

00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: I was young.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It was in my teens.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.557 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did anyone get
help for you after that?

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Or you had to kind of
go through this alone.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: No, no, no.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It was Northern Ontario.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.245 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty remote.

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
summer camp setting.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I became
kind of interested

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:90%
in the mind and the brain.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I don't want to
be out of control of my mind.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- so it was almost fear
of wanting to not lose my mind

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.983 align:middle line:84%
and have an intact brain
that developed my passion.

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so
interesting because I've

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
had a near-death
experience as well,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and I find that people
with near-death experiences

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
or out-of-body
experiences, commonly

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
detached slightly
from the brain,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and observe the
brain and the person.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So we the being, we the brain,
are observable to each other.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yes.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
fascinating, isn't it?

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yes.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I love that you
said that, actually,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because there's
a way that that's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:90%
a self protective mechanism.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes it happens
and it's not adaptive,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and it's called dissociation.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a trauma and
you separate from the trauma,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
then it's those people and those
experiences that never really

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%
join together.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a
sense of separation

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
between self and self,
if you know what I mean.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's a healthy way of
separating and not suffering

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.328 align:middle line:90%
the intensity of the moment.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
an unhealthy way.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Staying stuck
in the disassociation,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
which you see quite
often, and that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:90%
is labeled as mental illness.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: So often.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a root cause.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.715 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about root causes
because yes, you're right.

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And mental illness
has become in our awareness

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.047 align:middle line:90%
so much as an epidemic now.

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
always been there

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's now more reported
on, or if it really truly

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is on the rise because of
our stressful conditions

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
that we live in now.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
It's probably both.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that and
the rise of Alzheimer's, as we

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
spoke about in the
beginning of the show.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:90%
What are the current numbers--

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's in the
millions-- of people in the US

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that are diagnosed with
Alzheimer's, in the US alone?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Just the US?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I think we're close to 6
million, like, 5.7 million.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.645 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I have a
slide, a recent slide,

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I think, from maybe the
Centers for Disease Control

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that there's a big
concern that it's growing.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, it is growing.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
In England, I just
read that's the first--

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
first-- leading cause of death.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's a tsunami of concern
around cognitive decline.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't all end up as
Alzheimer's, but there's

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
a whole subset of
people who are actually

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
just with cognitive decline
and haven't been diagnosed yet.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm glad you told that
story because that's exactly

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
the way many of us feel.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:90%
You forget your keys.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You can't remember a
conversation you had

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:90%
with someone, and it's scary.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It is.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you're
afraid of your own mind.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: That's
exact-- and you're

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:90%
afraid of losing your mind.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
really a lot of us

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:90%
are afraid of losing our minds.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more we
talk about it over the show,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
the more we'll maybe just start
to tease apart what is memory

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and what is self, because I
have some questions about that

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.758 align:middle line:84%
myself, as I've been in this
field for over 30 years.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's fascinating.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It's interesting.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We do know that this
has become a moral issue.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, down the line, if
this continues to increase,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
it's going to become a financial
burden on us and, of course,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:90%
as caregivers.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's in this position
right now, being a caregiver,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and it is very, very stressful.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people are going

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to be in that position
yes as we go on.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Wow.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Is she supported?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the key
is support for caregivers.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
We have some sad
and scary statistics

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that caregivers suffer an
increased burden for risk

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%
for dementia themselves.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, there
are many, many reasons.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:90%
There's just speculation now.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
It could be that when
you're just a caregiver,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
think about your mom.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Is she taking care of herself?

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I'll go
through the list.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Is she sleeping well?

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Is she eating well?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Is she loved and
supported by a lot

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:90%
of friends on a regular basis?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She's turning
all that away.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.335 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: There you go.

00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Is she cognitively stimulated?

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.922 align:middle line:90%
See, this is a key thing.

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:28.193 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's another key thing.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
She looks for things
that are interesting.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And she dives into it because
she loves my dad so much.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Totally.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it is very
true that caregivers,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
even sons and daughters
of aging parents,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:90%
it is very challenging.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
the aging parent

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to be a burden.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a loop where
we do need to address it.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, is
our mental challenges

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and Alzheimer's genetic?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are they?

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I think I'll have
to separate them out.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We know now that we
inherit from our mothers

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and we inherit from
our father's genes.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Most of Alzheimer's disease that
is called familial Alzheimer's

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
disease is very, very focused in
very few families in the world,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe several hundred
families in the world.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That's familial
Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It has a very strong
genetic component.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.465 align:middle line:90%
So that means that--

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I would hope it wouldn't
be in your family,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but if it was in your
family, it would mean,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.622 align:middle line:84%
most people would have
it, and you'd know.

00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It would be aunts and uncles
and mothers and fathers.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's called an
early onset gene,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
so you people get it early in
those very select families.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
That is a very different
Alzheimer's disease

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
than what most people
in a general population

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.382 align:middle line:90%
are concerned about.

00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
In the general
population, there is

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
a gene that's marked for late
onset Alzheimer's disease, as

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the early onset, and
it's APOE, Apolipoprotein E,

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and you either get a 2, a 3,
or 4, but you get two of them.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can get a 2 and
a 3, or a 3 and a 3.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm a 3 and a 3.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what you are.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you have a
predisposition for Alzheimer's.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yes.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So the APOE 4 is
the concerning one,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and your risk increases if
you have two copies of APOE 4.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the worthwhile
information.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
That's something that we should
know that about ourselves.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
We should know, if we
have an increased risk,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.548 align:middle line:84%
not to be worried
but to be proactive.

00:08:33.548 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's an
easy test, right?

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It's very easy.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the--

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I won't mention necessarily
specific companies,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
but very easy test of
just a swab in your mouth.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And you send it to the
company and they'll tell you.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can find out
all you have this APOE gene.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you have two copies, your
increased risk is significant.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
If you only have one copy,
and it's an APOE 3, 4,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:84%
your risk is a little bit
greater than a 3, 3, like me,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's still an
increased risk.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would we want
to know or would it--

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.217 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Good question.

00:09:06.217 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --actually program us?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: No, I think
that's kind of key.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
It's how fearful are we, how
hesitant are we to find out

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
want to be afraid,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to think
that we're pre-programmed

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:90%
or predestined to.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But we are living in such rich
times of information now, Lisa.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:90%

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I mean, it's

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.623 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: We're lucky.

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I've watched this
whole field start

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with the smallest tiny little
drugs looking for a solution,

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:90%
and failing, failing, failing.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Drug companies have
failed 99% of the time

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to find any single targeted
medicine for Alzheimer's

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.208 align:middle line:90%
or cognitive decline.

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But we have so many
other things we can do.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is why you
have the Healthy Brain Clinic.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you
have these, maybe,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
predisposed for this
gene, there are many ways

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
to activate and deactivate
the gene, right?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Perfect.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of the
risk factors in the way

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.748 align:middle line:90%
you activate this gene?

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to talk about the ways

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
that you don't activate it.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's really smart.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think some
of it's intuitive,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
but I also want to emphasize
that everything I'm

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
going to say now, I'm
educating all of us.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.357 align:middle line:84%
I'm educating myself
as I go along.

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm educating communities.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm educating you.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
for the purpose

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of empowering other people to
find out for themselves what's

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
possible for them in their
lives, what's doable,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
what's not overwhelming,
and also what's out there.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So the science says this.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Your sleep is very important.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We do not take that
nearly seriously enough.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How much sleep?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Eight hours, six hours?

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: The key
is if you can get

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:90%
consistent sleep, that's great.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Yep, usually between
seven and eight.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's consistent sleep.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So it means you
need to find out--

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
or if you're really snoring
badly, doctors in our clinic

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.623 align:middle line:84%
say go get a test
for sleep apnea

00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to see if you're actually
really sleeping during the night

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:90%
or not sleeping.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
What the brain does during sleep
is it clears some of the toxins

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that build up in the brains
of people with Alzheimer's.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It clears them out.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
then you activate your
glymphatic system.

You know you have a lymphatic
system in your body?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, our brains have
a glymphatic system

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
for glial cells, and so
it's called glymphatic.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's a little
garbage collection

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
system that's active at night.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.253 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:11:53.253 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Body's so intelligent.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: I know.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So then getting plenty
of sleep, eating probably

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
the correct foods
is a good idea.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
What other things though
would prevent or activate

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%
this Alzheimer's gene?

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, what
would activate

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.743 align:middle line:90%
it would be a lot of sugar.

00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
See, I've never been asked
the question in this way,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:90%
so I love it.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm asked about
what deactivates.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But really, what
activates it would be--

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We need to know.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: --the SAD diet,
the Standard American Diet.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Saturated fats, like a lot of
fried food, no sleep, a lot of

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:90%
loneliness.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're really-- yeah,
a lot of loneliness.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.228 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I thought that SAD
stood for Sugar Alcohol Dairy.

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Oh, that's funny.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's true.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those things
also cause inflammation.

00:12:46.275 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So other things that
would cause inflammation, sugar

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
What does inflammation
do to the brain

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.165 align:middle line:84%
in order to activate
this Alzheimer's gene?

00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Let's back
up because you

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
touched on a really important
point about inflammation.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.557 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the standard American
diet is pro-inflammatory,

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
things in our lives

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that are pro-inflammatory.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened-- recently,
there's been some very exciting

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
new discoveries in the
last four or five years,

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually many
contributors are responsible

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
for the onset of a degenerative
disease like Alzheimer's.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the categories,
one of the root causes,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
for why that might
happen is inflammation.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So that would be like a category
of why someone might have it.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Another is the sugar sensitivity
that you spoke about,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and that sugar and insulin
start to wreak havoc.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Another is, do we have
enough support in our bodies

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
like hormone support?

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
How's our thyroid doing?

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the things
that our doctors look at.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, there's
some risk factors as well.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's the inflammatory
subtype, the glycotoxic,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
which is very sugar
sensitive, diabetes related.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You've heard Alzheimer's disease
referred to as type 3 diabetes

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
sometimes?

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.345 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And then there's
the hormone related.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I
actually haven't.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Type 3 diabetes is
Alzheimer's related?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, because of the
great involvement of sugar

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and how the body ends up--

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
how sugar ends up to
be toxic, actually.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.338 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
considered type 3.

00:14:24.338 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Glycotoxicity,
that's right.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's 1.5, but
it doesn't really matter.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But it is one of the subtypes,
as Dr. Bredesen calls it.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about
some of the risk factors

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
that-- and this could also

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.665 align:middle line:84%
go for mental illness,
though, right?

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: That's a
very good point.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a leap.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know the genetic
literature well enough

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
on mental illness,
specifically, but I

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
do know that they're very,
very strongly interrelated

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and that if you have a
history of mental illness,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
chronic depression,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
then the key regions
in your brain that are

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:90%
responsible for memory shrink.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:90%
For example, the hippocampus--

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
heard of the hippocampus.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
small region, but very

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
responsible for memory
consolidation and memory

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And so people who have
chronic depression or PTSD

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
have changes in the reach same
regions of the brain-- and this

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
is something I'm very
passionate about,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between mental
illness and brain changes,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and then the possible
risks that you

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
have for these neurodegenerative
diseases, which

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I think is a very big deal.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
That's not talked about enough,
really, as a risk factor.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you mentioned that,
that memory has a lot to do

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the memory and the
brain are very related,

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do
with mental illness.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Well I think that the way I
put it together is region.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:10%
one particular region of the
brain that ends up shrinking

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:10%
is the hippocampus, and it
tends to shrink when you have

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:10%
very, very chronic depression.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at it like
money in a bank account.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.905 align:middle line:84%
If your hippocampus is already
very small from depression,

00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:84%
then if you're going
to have more loss,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have more likelihood

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:90%
of getting Alzheimer's disease.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But which
one starts first,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:84%
just to make this very
relatable to people--

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.795 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: You're right.

00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If people have tough
lives and tragic events happen,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.782 align:middle line:84%
that causes the memory
center to want to deactivate

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you get
into the mental illness?

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that the way
that it would go?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: That's actually very
interesting way to put it.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
best way to explain

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
it is that everyone who
has chronic depression

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
is looking for ways to feel
a great sense of relief

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, and that
the right therapies actually

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:84%
can improve the size of the
hippocampus with depression.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So that
gets into-- yeah.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are really
plastic, and there's

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:90%
a great deal of hope.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
that's good to know.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's fantastic.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually do
a lot more to repair--

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.035 align:middle line:84%
not to reverse, but to really
repair and be proactive here.

00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the idea of getting

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
older and memory decline?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Does it have to be true?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's important.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's important
because we do all--

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
cognitive decline
is part of aging.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the model
that we work in,

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
for root causes

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're approaching
imbalances in the body, then

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
have cognitive decline

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:90%
as readily as we do now.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking
care of the sugar load

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
care of inflammation

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
care of your exercise,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're socially stimulated
and cognitively stimulated,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
what I say is there's so
much you could do to prevent.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the brain
changes as you age.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Some people
say you get more wise.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a neuropsychologist who
wrote a book called "The Wisdom

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Paradox."

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that
our brains may change

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and we may lose
certain details, but we

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:84%
may grow another kind of
awareness and intelligence

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.352 align:middle line:90%
that actually--

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Makes us wiser.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: --serves us.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fantastic.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.013 align:middle line:84%
So speaking about
research, there's

00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of research
that's come out.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, you
work with a doctor

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that talked about some research
that came out about 2014,

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:90%

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%

>>RUSK: Bredesen.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bredesen.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
was so pioneering

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:84%
is because prior to that,
we'd been really focused

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
on finding a silver
magic bullet medicine.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I told you already that the
big pharmaceutical companies

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:90%
have not succeeded at all.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
There are several
medicines that are used now

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that don't modify the
course of the illness at all

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and they do not cure
the illness at all.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
a lot of research

00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
going into this, a lot of
funding, a lot of money.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: So much money.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I read a statistic yesterday
that this country has spent

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
$1.9 billion in 2018 to
find a drug for Alzheimer's.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I know, staggering.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.373 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In one year?

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: One year.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So I just imagine
where that money

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:84%
could have been used if I
had had it or you had had it.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well what
would you do with it?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I would definitely
do more shows like this.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I would do education programs
for exercise and aging.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I would publicly
fund programs that

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
were food related in schools.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
I'd teach kids how to meditate.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd teach parents
how to parent, how

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to raise a child with a
healthy nervous system.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a whole new
model would emerge.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But what Dr. Bredesen did,
just to get back to that,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
is he spent 30 years as a
research neurologist at UCLA

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Buck Institute
on Aging in California.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we were
trained by him.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, boy, this factor
plays into Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this metabolic change
plays into Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And he accumulated decades'
worth of metabolic changes

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.452 align:middle line:84%
and perturbations that are
imbalances that contribute

00:20:29.452 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to Alzheimer's disease.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So rather than looking at
like one particular thing,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
he researched all the many
things that contributed.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
And he created a model--

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
this inflammation, this
GI, stomach, dysbiosis,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
sugar sensitivity, all kinds
of very technical things that--

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.252 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Socialization.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So then
there are the other

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
there are the
metabolic risk factors,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and then there are the
other risk factors.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I call them the external
environmental factors,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:84%
like exercise, socializing,
connecting with your own mind,

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:84%
being stimulated,
wanting to grow.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And knowing
that the brain is,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.818 align:middle line:10%
as you say, plastic, what does
that mean, neuroplasticity?

00:21:12.818 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the brain is like
a giant Tupperware container.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.235 align:middle line:90%
It actually changes.

00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, this actually was a
neuropsychologist, Donald Hebb,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Canadian, like me.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:90%
OK and a long time ago.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
He said a phrase that is now
coined as neurons that fire

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.335 align:middle line:90%
together wire together.

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:90%
You've probably heard that.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So that was an
interpretation of his teaching.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And his teaching was that, gee,
if you use this pathway a lot,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
this pathway will be
used and well greased.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't use that
pathway, then it won't be used.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think we had ideas
about neuroplasticity

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, but we're just
starting to implement them now

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
as we're becoming more aware
of brain health and use them.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So neuroplasticity is
the brain's ability

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.097 align:middle line:84%
to change and be flexible,
depending upon its environment.

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want to emphasize
the difference

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:84%
between internal environment
and external environment.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
External environment is
you and I connecting.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We're engaged with each
other, we're learning.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And internal environment is my
thinking, my negative thinking,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
whether or not I rest my body
and my mind and my brain,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
so more the internal factors,
how I process the world.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Do I know how to rest?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
How do I use my
mind and my brain?

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:90%
How do I think?

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Am I stressed?

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Does my nervous
system rest and know

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
how to go into a
relaxation response?

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Those are all good things.

our world is those things

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:90%
you just mentioned.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It's fast paced.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:90%
There are so many distractions.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't sleep well.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%

things that come--

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
how do you suggest with
the Healthy Brain Program

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
to deal with these
stressors in life?

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.700 align:middle line:90%

don't see that it's only--

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%

question, like you're asking.

I remember my grandfather
who did mental math.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.792 align:middle line:84%
He used to do columns

are equivalent to safety.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Rest and relaxation are
equivalent to safety to me,

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the nervous
system understands it, too.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're really
engaged in a threat response--

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: --very often
with our bombardment.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like changing
an ethic around simplicity

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:90%
and welcoming rest.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
People worry about not doing
because there's so much value

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
in doing, but valuing the
regenerative rest, not just

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.608 align:middle line:90%
in sleep but just in the pause.

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So you're going
to have imbalances,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:10%
but there's a way to
correct the imbalances.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
take the pause.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Yeah, I think
that's very important.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from as our
external factors,

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:90%
we can do that as a pause.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Internally, I think
it's really important

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
to have a great physician who's
on your side with prevention

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:90%
tools.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get a
functional medicine doctor, all

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the better, who
integrates root cause

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and checks out all of
the root causes in terms

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of your metabolism,
and says, wow, we

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
can balance this
out internally--

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
your gut, if you have mold,
if you have inflammation.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We can balance these things out
to make your cognition better

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and just to make your
overall nervous system relax

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:90%
a bit more.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
it's fascinating.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.145 align:middle line:84%
You're the first
person that I've

00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
heard that says that mental
illness has a root cause, many

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Right.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, thanks for reinterpreting
it that way, but I do.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I also really see that
mental illness has a lot

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with early, unresolved
developmental trauma

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:90%
and childhood trauma.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And I just encourage--

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I myself feel like that's been a
very important part of my life.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.763 align:middle line:10%
And the people
who I love, I feel

00:26:55.763 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:10%
like that's part of
the healing journey,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:10%
for us to just know where
we came from and just

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:10%
begin to do the healing
and repairing in this life,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:03.900 align:middle line:10%
in this body.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what's
neuropsychotherapist does?

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, specifically,
a neuropsychol--

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I've integrated these things.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I've integrated trauma and
the health of the brain

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and the health of
cognition in my own way.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But neuropsychologists
look at cognition.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:90%
They look at thinking.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
They look at the brain,
different aspects of thinking,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
different categories
of thinking.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think most people
know that our thinking is

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
divided into categories.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:84%
We think about
memory, primarily.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Like, you mentioned your keys.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:90%
That's a memory thing.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But actually, maybe
it's not a memory thing.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a sensory
overload thing

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
because you were doing a
few too many things at once.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, it was an attention
thing and a focus thing,

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:90%
just as an example.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So sometimes people
worry about their memories,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:84%
but it may not be
their memories.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:90%
It might just doing too much.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm also a huge fan
of neurofeedback and EEG

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and those types of technologies.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.285 align:middle line:84%
They're not invasive their
nonmedical-- or medicine.

00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they
really are effective.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But why don't they
have the credibility

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
that some of the medicines have?

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they
not studied enough?

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Oh, just
recently neurofeedback

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:90%
has been studied so much.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting
to incorporate it

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
into our clinic
for mild cognitive

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
impairment along with some other
kind of fun and cool devices.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Neurofeedback didn't have the
credibility for a long time,

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was partly
a licensing thing

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and who was able to do it.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So there were, in the
early days, people

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:84%
doing it, who may not have
had certain trainings.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're so much more
effective now, the trainings,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and it really has a
good research base now.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So for example
with neurofeedback,

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm collaborating with
someone on a neurofeedback

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
trial with infrared light with
Parkinson's disease patients

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and Alzheimer's patients.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So it is being used in clinical
trials now for memory problems,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:84%
for cognitive decline, and
for things like Parkinson's.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.813 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a lot
more credibility now

00:29:15.813 --> 00:29:16.855 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the research.

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.063 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it's fascinating.

00:29:18.063 --> 00:29:20.512 align:middle line:84%
It just teaches your brain
how to self regulate.

00:29:20.512 --> 00:29:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: That's a
really good point.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the more your
brain trains that, as you said,

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.995 align:middle line:84%
the more neurons fire
together they wire together.

00:29:27.995 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If it can train
your brain to self regulate,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and it forms a pattern,
then it gets you off

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of your old habit pattern.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And the brain
learns a new pattern.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's good for a
traumatic brain injury,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and for trauma, early
childhood trauma.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: But I recommend
people get diagnosed well.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of the reason
something like neurofeedback

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
may not have worked consistently
for all those years is

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
because maybe people weren't
getting diagnosed properly.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a
neuropsychologist

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
first or a neurologist firs,
and you're getting diagnosed

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.913 align:middle line:84%
and you know what you're
dealing with-- it's

00:30:02.913 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
kind of like getting
diagnosed with,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
instead of just knee pain,
you're getting diagnosed with,

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, you have an infection.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I know how to
treat your knee pain.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not a torn tendon it's
almost like finding out

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the good diagnosis first before
you decide what the treatment

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:90%
intervention is.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And then neurofeedback
has amazing utility.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's so many
things that we can do,

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked a little bit
about the cognitive training.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.110 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a little
bit about diet.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Exercise you mentioned.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.913 align:middle line:90%
What else can we do?

00:30:34.913 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: I want to
talk a little bit more

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
about the cognitive
training, if that's OK.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Just because
we didn't cover some--

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I like to make a prescription
for cognitive training.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.025 align:middle line:84%
So we have enough data now
from the National Institutes

00:30:47.025 --> 00:30:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of Health and
National Institutes

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
of Aging and the FINGER study.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:84%
These are huge studies,
with thousands of subjects

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.195 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
the FINGER study?

00:30:56.195 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: The FINGER study is
a big study from Scandinavia,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and they modified
a lot of things

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:90%
in people's environments.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So did the National
Institutes of Aging

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
study called the ACTIVE study.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They modified a lot of things
in people's environments

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:84%
like their exercise and
their cognitive training

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and various things,
and they showed

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
what worked to delay cognitive
decline, so things that

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:90%
really helped.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So cognitive training,
I could prescribe it.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I could prescribe it to you.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You should go to an
online program that--

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
if it's OK if I name it
right now, the one we use

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:84%
is the Posit Science one, and
train yourself 15 to 20 minutes

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.800 align:middle line:84%
several times a week
on particular tasks

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
so that your brain learns--
just like with neurofeedback

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:90%
but in a different way.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:84%

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.110 align:middle line:84%
it's good to train your speed

>>LISA: Yeah, because
you mentioned the pause.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So after you do something
stimulating like that--

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is my question-- do
you need a relaxation response

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%
to something like that?

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a
very stimulating day,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
do you need some
type of a relaxation

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.300 align:middle line:90%
at the end of your day?

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Oh, I would
say absolutely.

00:33:20.364 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:90%
what the research is showing?

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:10%

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.062 align:middle line:10%
>>RUSK: Exercise is really good.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Not so long
ago, many scientists

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:10%
believed that the brain did not
change after childhood, that it

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:10%
was hardwired and fixed by
the time we became adults.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But recent advances in
only the last decade

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:84%
now tell us that this
is simply not true.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The brain can and does
change throughout our lives.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It is adaptable like plastic,
hence neuroscientists

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:90%
call this neuroplasticity.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:10%
How does neuroplasticity work?

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.110 align:middle line:84%
If you think of your brain as a
dynamic, connected power grid,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:84%
there are billions of
pathways on roads lighting up

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
every time you think,
feel, or do something.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of these roads
are well traveled.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.989 align:middle line:10%
These are our habits, our
established ways of thinking,

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:10%
feeling, and doing.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Every time we think
in a certain way,

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:10%
practice a particular task,
or feel a specific emotion,

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.070 align:middle line:10%
we strengthen this road.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It becomes easier for our
brains to travel this pathway.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Say we think about something
differently, learn a new task,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:90%
or choose a different emotion.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:90%
We start carving out a new road.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:84%
If we keep traveling
that road, our brains

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
begin to use this pathway
more, and this new way

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, feeling, or
doing becomes second nature.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The old pathway gets used
less and less and weakens.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
This process of rewiring
your brain by forming you can

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and weakening old ones is
neuroplasticity in action.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that we all
have the ability to learn

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and change by
rewiring our brains.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have ever
changed a bad habit

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:84%
or thought about
something differently,

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:84%
you have carved a new
pathway in your brain

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and experienced
neuroplasticity firsthand.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.300 align:middle line:10%
With repeated and directed
attention towards your desired

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:10%
change, you can
rewire your brain.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:90%

you're also taking
care of your brain.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:10%

Right.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's constantly
wanting to interact.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole field called
interpersonal neurobiology

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Daniel Siegel
the psychiatrist's term.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's a yearning
for us, from a brain point

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.038 align:middle line:90%
of view, for us to connect.

00:38:15.038 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's not necessarily
through watching television.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: No.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's got to be
personal interaction.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.855 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:38:20.855 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say that watching TV
is solitary, not interactive.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about interacting
on Facebook and Instagram

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Is that also considered
social interaction?

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, right now
I would say that it is.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.975 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like
moving your body.

00:38:35.975 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
talking to someone.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
there's going to need

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to be more research
that studies,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is that indeed social
engagement the way

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.500 align:middle line:90%
you and I are doing right now?

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.405 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:38:59.405 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yes, it really does.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Breast cancer survivors--

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I think you could make a
brush stroke across the board.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Social connection--
and I'm talking

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
about positive
social connection,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's a difference
because, unfortunately,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.310 align:middle line:84%
so many of us live in
situations that aren't

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:90%
as warm and fuzzy for us.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good
to remember that we

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
can shift some of
those relationships

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
of work and create

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.763 align:middle line:84%
more peace at home or peace with
those difficult relationships.

00:39:45.763 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is really
important to know

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.530 align:middle line:84%
because so much
of our population

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is in the aging category.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And as we go into rest homes
or senior care centers,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.880 align:middle line:90%
not to forget the aging person.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
senior abuse and things

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that happen because our
aging population tends

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to be cast aside.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.180 align:middle line:84%
The traditions that
we used to have

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.790 align:middle line:84%
with elders living
with rest is not

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:90%
so much in the modern family.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.965 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: I'm so on your page.

00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:90%

So what would-- we have
hectic busy lives, too.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So how do you suggest
that, when you

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.545 align:middle line:84%
do have time with your
elder, your parent

00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
or your grandparent,
what can you

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
do rather than just sitting and
watching television together

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to actually stimulate each
other's interaction and brain?

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.195 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends really
on how well you know

00:40:43.195 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:90%
the person who you're with.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a family member,
you can also inquire.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Together, you can make it a
really fun and enjoyable thing

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.930 align:middle line:84%

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It might be a puzzle.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:90%
It might be--

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coloring.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:84%
It might be coloring
books together,

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and just parallel
play like our kids do.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
It might be if they're
very physically active--

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.478 align:middle line:90%
like, I do yoga with my mother.

00:41:07.478 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And I engage with her
because she's really physical,

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:84%
so we engage a lot
physically together.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's almost an opportunity--

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.450 align:middle line:84%
as you ask the question,
it's an opportunity

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to engage and to find out more
about the person who you're

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:90%
wanting to engage with and ask.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Say, what is it
that you love to do?

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.965 align:middle line:84%
What can we do together now
that we haven't done together

00:41:26.965 --> 00:41:28.862 align:middle line:84%
that would be challenging
for both of us?

00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's important.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I did that with my dad.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We bought coloring
books, and it's

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:84%
fun just to do the little
detailing together.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's
not much said,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain just
social interaction

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:90%

>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
She had a stroke in a
part of the brain that's

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:84%
responsible for speaking, and
she had a Broca's aphasia.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Broca's area was
affected, and that

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
was just one of the things that

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.530 align:middle line:90%
with her.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Her name's Elisa, and she
totally gave me permission

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk about her.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: But she had
a very severe stroke,

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and she's recovering.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It's only been months, actually.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: She's doing a really,
really great job of recovering.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And she was a fabulous
artist, and she's still

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.380 align:middle line:84%
a fabulous artist, but her
art has really changed.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And she just did a tour
of her studio and a show,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and she showed me the
performers and the afters.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a good example,
really, of neuroplasticity,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:90%
as you ask about it.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity is
the brain's ability

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.370 align:middle line:84%
to shift and change
according to need

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and according to environmental
factors, internal and external.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.000 align:middle line:90%
That's our definition together.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And she used to make art
that was extremely detailed.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:84%
It was just very focused
on specific colors

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and detail, tiny,
tiny brush strokes.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And the way she describes
her art now, post stroke,

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:90%
is she says it's like wabi sabi.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just twisted
and not as detailed.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I personally find it
more appealing to me,

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.960 align:middle line:84%
as someone who loves art,
because it's abstract.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not as representational.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So before,
it was the fine art

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
skills which we see in this
photo right of the waterfall.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, it was the
way she perceives everything.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a
waterfall, but more abstract,

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:39.060 align:middle line:90%
less representational.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.612 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I could see the
waterfall in the second photo.

00:43:41.612 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's interesting.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way that she
would perceive the waterfall,

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.950 align:middle line:90%
as something that would be--

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:46.825 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:49.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --wild and
loud and crazy.

00:43:49.055 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So she might have had
the same ideas when

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
she was painting or similar
ideas when she was painting

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:84%
both images, but it came
out completely different

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:84%
because that part
of her brain that

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.510 align:middle line:84%
was the fine detail-oriented
one wasn't working anymore.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.027 align:middle line:84%
So her brain adapted and is
using a different region now.

00:44:07.027 --> 00:44:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in terms
of post-stroke--

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and we do hear, statistically,
that you can improve

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:90%
post-stroke--

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.440 align:middle line:84%
but there are certain
things that you need to do.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of these cognitive
exercises, I think,

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:90%
are imperative, right?

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.765 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:44:23.765 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I think stimulation,
whether it's your body--

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the research shows--
it's not my area of expertise,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
but rehabilitation with
all of our patients--

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and many have had
head injuries, too--

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is practice and
challenge yourself.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say
to my patients,

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
stretch yourself, but
don't stress yourself.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So that means.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that your brain
is working overtime,

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.680 align:middle line:84%
but you don't get to a point
where you have like persistence

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:84%
stress because
then, again, you're

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:84%
building up toxins you don't
want like cortisol and--

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.820 align:middle line:84%
there's a fine balance
between stretching yourself

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and stretching your brain.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:90%
There is a fine balance.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
What does cortisol
do to the brain?

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It serves as a toxin.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we don't
want is we don't

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
want to get into that
perpetual threat response.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully we're
monitoring that for ourselves,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're not in
threatening situations.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.085 align:middle line:84%
And I know it
sounds silly, but--

00:45:25.085 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We are, yeah.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.002 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: --we're always in
threatening situations.

00:45:28.002 --> 00:45:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just realistic.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So then it's also
possible to learn.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
There's so many you know,
as you said, so many apps,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.910 align:middle line:90%
so many calming techniques.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are in
a mindfulness arena

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.990 align:middle line:84%
where we have access to
practice, just to notice,

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:49.093 align:middle line:84%
just to begin to notice
when were in hyperarousal.

00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that does
happen, but then there's

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:90%
also the relaxation response.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does that
naturally happen

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:84%
after the brain goes
into a stress response?

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It naturally goes into
a relaxation response?

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, if you
recover from your stress,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that recovery
feels good for your brain.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.750 align:middle line:90%
So yes, you become relaxed.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But does
it automatically

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:90%
happen in the brain?

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Yes, in the
body and the brain.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you-- let's say I met
with something very, very scary

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and I dealt with it
really, really well.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I either said,
oh, I'm so scared,

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:84%
or, you shouldn't
have done that.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I dealt with it
at the time, then

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.530 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't become a
prolonged stressor

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.675 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't feel
helpless in that moment.

00:46:31.675 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to kind
of work with the thing

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:90%
that made me feel threatened.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the big difference.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So yes, then you go into that
safety response, going, oh,

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.330 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'm totally fine.

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That saber-toothed black
Jaguar is not going to eat me.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So then you do go into
that relaxation response.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But if it's persistent,
then you don't as easily

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.282 align:middle line:90%
go into a sense of safety.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.570 align:middle line:84%

I don't know why my visual
spatial sense is off now.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:84%

kinds of thinking problems.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:84%

you what neuropsychologist

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:84%
look at in terms of
thinking categories

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.340 align:middle line:84%
so we could know
it for ourselves.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
There's memory, but then
memories divided into memory

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:42.907 align:middle line:84%
many, many categories like
remote memory, recent memory.

00:47:42.907 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And then there's learning.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
before you remember.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.895 align:middle line:84%
And then there's our visual
system and our spatial systems.

00:47:50.895 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Neuropsychologist look
at that, and attention

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:84%

that sort of thing.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.850 align:middle line:90%
it gets better faster?

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:13.773 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Each person--

00:50:13.773 --> 00:50:14.815 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the whole point--

00:50:14.815 --> 00:50:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.658 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point of
what we're talking about

00:50:17.658 --> 00:50:19.960 align:middle line:84%
is, as you've said,
this is personalized.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.240 align:middle line:90%
This is very individualized.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:84%
What you need is different
from what I need,

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and what I might
need is, depending

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:84%
upon where our areas
of growth need to be

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.790 align:middle line:84%
or where are areas
of weakness are,

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
or brain damage for someone
who's had a brain injury.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, people need
personalized treatment.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we do
help people who had

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.380 align:middle line:84%
concussive injuries, mild
traumatic brain injuries,

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.907 align:middle line:90%
traumatic brain injuries.

00:50:45.907 --> 00:50:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about Alzheimer's
patients who are on medication?

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Can you also still treat them?

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Mm-hmm.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bredesen and our doctors do
not generally take people off

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.020 align:middle line:84%
of anything that's
been prescribed

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:84%
until there's very
good evidence or it's

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.370 align:middle line:90%
been done very, very slowly.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea is the
functional medicine approach,

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.670 align:middle line:84%
personalizing and
individualizing

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:12.820 align:middle line:84%
care for something
like either head trauma

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or Alzheimer's disease,
very personalized.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And the functional
medicine doctor

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:84%
will work in conjunction with
someone's primary care provider

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a good
relationship with the one who's

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.290 align:middle line:84%
taking care of your general
everyday medical stuff.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said earlier
that a lot of the Alzheimer's

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:84%
medications do not work,
which is a strong statement

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to say for many people
that are on them.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: I know.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: How do you know they
don't work, or many of them?

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, the
evidence is that they

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.730 align:middle line:84%
don't work to change the
course of the illness.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So they don't change
the progression rate.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you have a rapidly
progressing illness,

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't change the
rate of the progression.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't stop you
from having the illness.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't stop the course
of the illness, either.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What they might do is they might
shorten or give you a few more

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:84%
months of cognitive clarity,
or they might enhance

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:90%
your cognition for a while.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And that works for
some people for some months.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you went into
any general neurology

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.080 align:middle line:84%
clinic or general
practitioner clinic,

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.797 align:middle line:84%
they would have to say that they
don't work very well at all.

00:52:24.797 --> 00:52:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's why
there's constant research being

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.030 align:middle line:90%
done to see what does work.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about for
supplementation for brain

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:90%
enhancement or memory?

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.843 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend any
supplements for memory?

00:52:37.843 --> 00:52:38.643 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:52:38.643 --> 00:52:39.910 align:middle line:90%
In our clinic, we have--

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.880 align:middle line:84%
but again, it requires
a root cause looking at,

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.053 align:middle line:90%
do you have inflammation?

00:52:44.053 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Are you sensitive to sugars?

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.330 align:middle line:90%
How's your gut working?

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you have candida?

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe have a lot of heavy metals
in your body from amalgams

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.403 align:middle line:84%
or aluminum or copper or
any of the other metals

00:52:55.403 --> 00:52:56.320 align:middle line:90%
that might accumulate.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.070 align:middle line:90%
How's your detox system working?

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.550 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
our doctors check on.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:04.402 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole team approach
to taking care of one brain.

00:53:04.402 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: It's kind of like--

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But it goes to
show you how, as we

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about those single,
targeted, silver bullet

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.960 align:middle line:84%
strategies drug companies
are looking for,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it kind of makes sense
that it doesn't make sense,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.990 align:middle line:84%
or that it needs a whole
kind of personalized

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:23.045 align:middle line:84%
individualized
lifestyle approach?

00:53:23.045 --> 00:53:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see what
you're talking about

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.370 align:middle line:84%
because if you were to give
somebody just take the vitamin

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:84%
approach and a
memory supplement,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but yet they have a
lot of information

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot
of sugar and they're

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of fear-based
thinking and not

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.590 align:middle line:84%
any detoxification, the
supplement's just going

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.460 align:middle line:90%
to just be wasted in the body.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Mm-hmm.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's going
to get taken over

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:90%
by all of these other things.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
everyone can do.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.935 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:53.135 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Really, we all can
look at our detoxification.

00:53:53.135 --> 00:53:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We can all
look at the things that

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.260 align:middle line:84%
are great for our bodies
that have no sugar.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Wheat and dairy to be
concerned about if you

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.870 align:middle line:84%
want to really take the
inflammation out of the body,

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.155 align:middle line:90%
you can test it yourself.

00:54:06.155 --> 00:54:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:08.905 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these things
you can do at home now.

00:54:08.905 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like you could test
for your genetic profiling,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.080 align:middle line:84%
you can also test to see if
your gluten sensitive or not.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.937 align:middle line:84%
Most of our patients are
off of gluten just in case.

00:54:16.937 --> 00:54:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Just because
the current wheat

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is not very digestible,
healthy, and tends

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:90%
to be pro-inflammatory.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The best thing to do
is you could just take yourself

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.740 align:middle line:84%
off of that for a couple
of-- maybe a week,

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and then see how you feel,
if you're thinking faster,

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.900 align:middle line:84%
if you're more agile, if
your body doesn't ache,

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.990 align:middle line:84%
if you can spring out
of bed and exercise.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:44.255 align:middle line:84%
And then if you add it back
into your body, what happens?

00:54:44.255 --> 00:54:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.505 align:middle line:84%
You could be your
own experiment.

00:54:46.505 --> 00:54:47.675 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Easy to do.

00:54:47.675 --> 00:54:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the supplements,
I just want to say you can just

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Google online nootropics,
N-O-O-T-R-O-P-I-C-S.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You can Google.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:59.973 align:middle line:84%
You can look online and
you can find the ones

00:54:59.973 --> 00:55:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that you think makes sense
for you if you don't want

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to go to a functional
medicine doctor

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.600 align:middle line:90%
or a preventative medicine.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you think those work?

00:55:05.933 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:90%
What is a nootropics?

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: There's a whole
class of supplements now

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.012 align:middle line:84%
that are for brain health
and brain enhancement.

00:55:13.012 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
none of our doctors

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.680 align:middle line:84%
just recommend those
because, again, we

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.340 align:middle line:84%
can increase the health
of the cells in our brain.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:24.018 align:middle line:84%
But if we have leaky
gut, then is the medicine

00:55:24.018 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:84%
going to go-- is
the supplement going

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.100 align:middle line:90%
to go where it needs to go?

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're supposed to
eat tons of leafy greens

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.683 align:middle line:84%
and you do and you're
healing your gut

00:55:30.683 --> 00:55:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing a
few other things,

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.980 align:middle line:84%
then that seems like
the more sensible way

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.940 align:middle line:84%
to approach root cause rather
than just taking, again,

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.450 align:middle line:84%
a supplement thinking it's going
to be a silver bullet targeted

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.660 align:middle line:90%
strategy.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So but I
actually want to know,

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
the nootropics work?

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there
is a possibility of taking

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:53.970 align:middle line:84%
these precursors to
serotonin that could actually

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:55.615 align:middle line:90%
help you release more--

00:55:55.615 --> 00:55:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they
really actually work?

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
them on the market.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: There's a lot of
medicines on the market that--

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: These are supplements.

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:02.895 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah, that's right.

00:56:02.895 --> 00:56:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I think some of them do.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I think some of them do.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I know that we recommend
some just for brain health,

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and the Institute for
Functional Medicine

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.310 align:middle line:84%
recommends some
for brain health.

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I could name some
now, but again,

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.180 align:middle line:84%
like if you take something
like rhodiola or bacopa,

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.220 align:middle line:84%
they may agree with me
in a very different way

this is causing me anxiety.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Is this good because I know
I have a blood sugar problem?

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.510 align:middle line:84%

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that one of the subtypes
that we were talking about

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.320 align:middle line:84%
earlier relates to
your question now,

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and sugar can become a toxin.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And many people are put on
to on ketogenic diet, which

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.950 align:middle line:84%
so many people are
talking about right now,

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.810 align:middle line:90%
paleo and keto diets.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
put on ketogenic diets

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.350 align:middle line:84%
because it allows the brain
just to work with fats

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and not work with sugars.

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do you
recommend that type of diet?

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Yeah.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our patients are
recommended ketogenic diets

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:84%
if they have a certain genetic
profile and if they're--

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.810 align:middle line:84%
with Alzheimer's disease
and the Bredesen protocol

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that subtypes Alzheimer's
disease so beautifully,

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:29.850 align:middle line:84%

ketogenic diet for everyone who

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:30.687 align:middle line:90%
has--

00:57:30.687 --> 00:57:31.520 align:middle line:90%
just about everyone.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because the high
fat, protein, low carb diet.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Low carb,
no carb, exactly.

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who are
very well are going on it

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and some people like
to be keto adapted.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.570 align:middle line:84%
That means that they're
adapted to using

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:50.340 align:middle line:84%
their own ketones for energy in
their brain instead of sugar.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.148 align:middle line:90%
But I don't do it.

00:57:52.148 --> 00:57:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I heard it not something
you can be on for very long.

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Well, that's the thing.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.022 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right, exactly.

00:57:57.022 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people are on it
for long periods of time.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.550 align:middle line:84%
People with Alzheimer's disease
need to be on that diet.

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:04.445 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.445 --> 00:58:05.820 align:middle line:84%
From the evidence
that I've read,

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.840 align:middle line:84%
people do very well
on ketogenic diets

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.340 align:middle line:90%
if you have Alzheimer's disease.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.657 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Because they're not
having to deal with the sugar.

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's basically
really getting off of sugar.

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.030 align:middle line:90%
What about caffeine?

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And increasing
fat, fat, fat, fat.

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The brain?

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: And not just
any fat-- exactly.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, is the
brain made up of--

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.630 align:middle line:84%
gray matter, but is that
gray matter primarily fat?

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: It works with--
the brain needs fat

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:31.380 align:middle line:90%
in order to function.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It needs sugar, too.

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But in people who have
neurodegenerative disease,

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.390 align:middle line:90%
it is not working properly.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sugar?

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:39.065 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: That's right.

00:58:39.065 --> 00:58:40.480 align:middle line:90%
So it's utilizing the fat.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.173 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:58:42.173 --> 00:58:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it uses fat
in order to what?

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Burn energy or--

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Yeah, as
an energy source.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As an energy source.

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RUSK: Exactly.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that helps with
the cognitive function.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.903 align:middle line:84%
What about the physical
matter of the brain?

00:58:51.903 --> 00:58:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Does the that help with that?

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.287 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: Well, I don't actually
know what the mechanism is.

00:58:57.287 --> 00:59:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I just know that that messages
are sent more efficiently

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.100 align:middle line:90%
as an energy source.

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of a
good analogy-- as fuel.

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So if it was for
fuel in your car,

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:84%
then a good way to
look at it would

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.500 align:middle line:84%
be if there was fuel
in your car that

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.000 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working, if
you had a diesel car,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000 align:middle line:84%
but you were using regular
fuel, your car really

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.030 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't work very well.

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.988 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A good analogy.

00:59:19.988 --> 00:59:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUSK: So for people who have
Alzheimer's disease, using

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.880 align:middle line:84%
your fuel to be fat
rather than sugar seems

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to be working for many of
the patients on the Bredesen

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.420 align:middle line:90%
protocol.

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great to know.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
ask you-- and I do

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:36.060 align:middle line:84%
with all guests-- what is the
biggest reason, your biggest

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:39.420 align:middle line:90%
why that you do what you do?

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:41.200 align:middle line:90%
You obviously love it.

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.720 align:middle line:10%
>>RUSK: I love what I do.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.650 align:middle line:10%
It's the why of why I
wake up every morning,

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.420 align:middle line:10%
and I do think about
that every morning.

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It's because I really care
about the relationship

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:56.550 align:middle line:84%
between mental health
and brain health.

00:59:56.550 --> 01:00:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I really care about educating
and dedicating my whole self

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to empowering people to love
themselves and take care

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of themselves and
to truly believe

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:12.730 align:middle line:84%
that they have a lot of
efficacy in their own lives.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:17.920 align:middle line:10%
So I also really believe
in knowing your mind

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.290 align:middle line:10%
and I encourage people
to know that this

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.500 align:middle line:10%
is a bigger journey
for them, my patients,

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.820 align:middle line:10%
that this is a healing journey.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And even if they're in a
difficult time in their lives,

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of a bigger
healing journey for them.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And that, indeed,
it's a soul's journey,

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:35.448 align:middle line:84%
that it's not just
a body journey.

01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a soul journey, too.

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And trying to put
the pieces together

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
is kind of my reason for
living in my own life

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.120 align:middle line:90%
and in other peoples as well.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what I've learned
is that exercise is important,

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:47.485 align:middle line:84%

01:00:47.485 --> 01:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
