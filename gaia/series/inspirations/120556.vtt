00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And our topic for this series,
taped at this Celebrate Your

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.390 align:middle line:10%
Life Conference here
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:10%
is to explore the
"I am" meaning.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is a
teacher of self-development

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:90%
for over 46 years, Denise Linn.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.664 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DENISE LINN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the "I
am" meaning, we've

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
been exploring this topic
in our conversation.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.051 align:middle line:90%
What does "I am" mean to you?

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I use those words a lot.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I use those words as a way
of centering and grounding.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:10%
And I say I am enough.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And adding that enough to it, I
spent so many years of my life

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:90%
feeling like I'm not enough.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But to say, I am enough,
what that says to me is here,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
now, in this moment, no
matter what the past has been,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:84%
no matter what's going to
happen in the future, I am.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I am here with you.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
I am here in this place.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I am enough simply
being here now.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:90%
So I love those words.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I love
adding enough to it.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you say it too,
it really centers and grounds

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:90%
the entire room.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And listening to
you say those words,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
it seems to just put
everything into present time,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and organizes it.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's got a beautiful
energy to it.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And you could easily
be a person that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
could live in your past and
the traumas of your past.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Your story is absolutely--
there's a lot of trauma there,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
but you don't seem to carry that
trauma over with you, do you?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: It doesn't define me.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't forget it, but I don't
allow it to become who I am.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say that
you're not allowing your past

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to define you, how do you
teach people to reframe trauma?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's not as
simple as one answer.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: A really important
aspect is forgiveness.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot forgive
until you're ready.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And some people
think that they have

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:90%
to forget in order to forgive.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to forget.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And some people think
forgiveness means

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
you have to forgive the act.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't forgive the
act of child abuse.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't forgive the act of rape.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think we need to.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a difference
between forgiving the act

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and forgiving the person.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible to
forgive someone what they

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:90%
did not for them, but for you.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Because as you hold on to
that anger, resentment,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and bitterness, it
eats away at you.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of your past, to be
able to forgive what others did

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to you, and forgive
yourself for what

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
you did to others, because we're
not perfect, that's what heals.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And to make the distinction
of forgiving the individual,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
but you do not need
to forgive the act,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that is an important
distinction for healing.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
We did another show where you
were on one of my Gaia shows,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
your story in depth.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time that I had heard it.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And briefly, you
were 16 years old.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you were on your motorbike,
and somebody shot you.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: Right.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you still have
the wounds in your body.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I do, yeah.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Somehow, miraculously,
you survived this.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I did.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds so dramatic.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was on my motorbike
and a guy ran into me.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
back and shot me,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and he had actually killed
a number of other women.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But actually, that was less
traumatic than the kind

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
of very dysfunctional
family that I had.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
sound as dramatic,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
but I had a mother who was
mentally ill and very violent.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had a father who was
sexually abusive to his girls.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And those wounds
went much deeper.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was a much longer
journey to release

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the damage and the
woundedness from those

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
than it was from being shot.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Although it doesn't
sound as dramatic.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:90%
That's saying a lot, though.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
When you look back into
the ancestral patterns,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that you talk a lot about,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is looking at the
ancestral pattern

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of the shooter, the ancestral
pattern of your father

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:90%
and your mother.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.564 align:middle line:84%
When you look back, does that
allow you to forgive them more?

00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LINN: Well, there's a
couple of things here.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.149 align:middle line:84%
One, almost everybody is doing
the best they can at the time.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well,
how can the guy?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
He was shooting.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
He could have done
better than that.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But given someone's
upbringing, their parents,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs of the society
they were raised in,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the kind of ways they were
programmed by their family,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
by their society,
by their religion,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
there but for the
act of God go I.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
understand that everybody

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is acting according
to their upbringing,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and their upbringing is a result
of their parents' upbringing,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps going
back generations.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And they've done some
really interesting research.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
ancestral syndrome.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And they found that trauma
travels through the genes,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's even things
that almost seem esoteric,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's as a result
of scientific research.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Religion travels
through the genes.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when there is trauma, for
example, if that is traveling,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
if your great grandparents
had trauma, literally,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a biochemical
ship that goes generation

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
research with mice.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And they'll program
mice to really dislike

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:90%
the smell of-- what is it?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Sweet cherry.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then what they've
found is generations later,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
mice will have an
aversion to that,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
even though they were never
exposed to it, because it

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:90%
travels through the genes.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The genes, yes.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LINN: And so I do work
with past life regression,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:10%
but I also do work with going
back into early childhood,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:10%
and beginning to unweave
some of those patterns,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:10%
but also to trace
our ancestors back.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Western culture is
one of the few cultures that

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't revere the ancestors,
honor the ancestors,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and actually think
about the ancestors.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent
that you can discover

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
what those patterns were, and
where they live inside of you,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
is to the extent that you
can begin to release them.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your background
Native American, yes?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: On my mother's side.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:84%
On my father's
side, I'm Scottish.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.171 align:middle line:90%
So that's Scottish.

00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:35.742 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have you traced back
any of those ancestral patterns

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
from your mother's side
and your father's side?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Well, on
my mother's side,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
her ancestors, my ancestors,
traveled on the Trail of Tears.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Trail of
Tears was, in brief,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
where a number of
nations, including

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
my nation, the
Cherokee Nation, were

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
forced off their
ancestral lands, forced

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.747 align:middle line:84%
to walk across most of the
United States, and end up in--

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and they lived in a
very fertile land.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
They were farmers-- and given
this barren land in Oklahoma.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And when the soldiers
talk about that march,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.795 align:middle line:90%
the people were stoic.

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
A child would die,
and they were only

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
allowed to stop every three
days to bury the dead.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So they would carry
the dead child.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And the soldiers
were so impressed,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
because the people
did not complain.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
A brother would carry
a sister who had died.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
They would carry the dead
without-- there was also

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
carts-- without complaining.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
And on one hand, I love the
fact that my ancestors were

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
so stoic, but on the other hand,
my grandmother, my grandfather,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
they were really stoic.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So it was in my immediate
ancestry as well,

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but when you're
stoic, underneath that

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you're
suffering and not

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:90%
speaking about it.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Numb.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: And when
I was growing up,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
the horrific things were
happening to me behind

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:90%
closed doors, horrific things.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was stoic.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I never told anybody.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a way, that
pattern that perhaps served

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:90%
my ancestors lived in me.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And now when something is not
right, I'll let people know.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.969 align:middle line:84%
I will raise my voice, because I
have broken that stoic pattern.

00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
important right there.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
When you raise your voice
and say, this is wrong,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
this is unjust--

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.628 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: And you take a stand.

00:09:29.628 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you take a stand.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
In that energy, you don't
care what anybody thinks.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any
concern there, do you?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: No, I deeply
care what people think,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm willing to speak my
truth in spite of the fact

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:90%
that I care.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And that, to me, is power.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You deeply
care what people think?

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I do.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, but I
mean in the context

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.622 align:middle line:84%
where, if you hurt
feelings, it doesn't matter.

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does matter.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't like hurting
feelings, and I

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
am willing to hurt
feelings if to not do

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
so means that I am stoically
not speaking my heart,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:90%
not speaking my truth.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is to
be offended by it,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
it's most likely because there's
an inauthenticity in there

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.501 align:middle line:90%
that you need to address?

00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Do you
know, I can't speak

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
for why other
people are offended,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and I mostly only speak
from what's real for me.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.329 align:middle line:84%
Because we just
don't know what's

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
going on with someone
else, so I'll just say this

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
is true for me.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:90%
This is not working for me.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what I feel is right
for me in this situation.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So going back to
the ancestral patterns,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
do you see that in other
people through intuition?

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:90%
How do you see that?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.902 align:middle line:90%
And regression?

00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:90%
How do you find that pattern?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: I love
the inner journey.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Because deep inside of
us, we know the truth.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:90%
The soul knows the truth.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we were thinking about
it, that's hard to find it.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But when we take time to
become still, and just

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
sink into that place,
we can find it.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the ways
that I work with people

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
is I take them on
inner journeys, what

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I call inner journeys.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They get so relaxed that
they can begin to explore,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:90%
to step back in time.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And even if you don't
know your ancestors,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
their voices are within you,
their blood is within you.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can almost
begin to trace it back.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can also access the
talents, and the abilities,

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:90%
the qualities that they had.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that's in you too.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.619 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
breaking the-- you know.

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The patterns,
the negative patterns

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%
if you have them.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: The pattern, thank you.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you can also bring--
that's an interesting point.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.354 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: And it's fantastic.

00:11:57.354 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can tap back
into those ancestral patterns

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and those talents.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.695 align:middle line:90%
Have you done that?

00:12:02.695 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: I have, and I
love it when I do that.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I think of my ancestors
on the Trail of Tears,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think, if
they could do that,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
if they could survive
that, I could survive.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:90%
I have that blood in me.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And we all have ancestors who
have had horrific things happen

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to them, and they survived.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to grab it
and pull it into this moment,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:90%
there's power in that.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we can
call upon our ancestors.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a new thought.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
probably more cultures

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
in the world that have, they
call it ancestor worship.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's not worship.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's honoring.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you honor the
ancestors, they're here.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And even in simple ways.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
My dad could fix anything.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
He was just one of those
guys that could fix anything.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we had
a dishwasher disposal,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't working.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And my husband, who'd
been a contractor

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.434 align:middle line:84%
and done plumbing contractor
stuff, and he was like,

00:13:01.434 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:90%
oh, it can't be fixed.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
We've got to call in
someone professional.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if my dad was there,
I thought he could fix it.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just got really quiet,
and I said, you know, dad,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:90%
would you come here?

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.092 align:middle line:84%
And I reached, and I don't
even know what I did,

00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and I fixed it.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it wasn't me.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I was calling upon--
and my husband's

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:90%
like, how did you that?

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, my dad did it.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But you can call
upon your ancestors.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
In homes around the world,
there's ancestor altars.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Some people have houses.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, I've spent time
with the Zulu in Africa,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and they really honor
their ancestors.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:90%
They call upon their ancestors.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:84%
When I was with the Zulu-- I
mean the Maoris in New Zealand,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
once again, they will call out
the names of their ancestors.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was in China,
they honor the ancestors.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Why would they honor ancestors
for thousands of years?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, it works.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have angels
and guardian angels,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
but why not ancestors too?

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Get all the help you can get.

>>LINN: Well, let
me take a step back.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
For many years, when
I traveled the world,

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I sought out those in native
cultures, who were still

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:90%
living in a natural way.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that they
had knowledge and wisdom

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:90%
that we have lost.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And so much of it is dying.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Those elders, when
they die, a lot of them

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
have not passed it on.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
found in native cultures

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
around the world
was space clearing.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Or I called it space clearing.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a few books
on it, and now there's

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:84%
lots of books called
space clearing.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I coined the word,
and I thought, gee,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
they're going to think that--
I thought, space clearing?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're up
in space with a broom.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.911 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't think
of another word,

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:90%
so I named it space clearing.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you
created that word?

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: Yeah.

00:15:14.395 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic, yes.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I did.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was surprised it took off.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a meme now.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.155 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:15:20.155 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: But again,
space clearing

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
has been around
because it works.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And even the largest
realtor in Manhattan

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.685 align:middle line:84%
was having-- anyway, I won't
say who it was, but anyway,

00:15:31.685 --> 00:15:33.435 align:middle line:84%
they were having
trouble-- it's written up

00:15:33.435 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
at the New York Times--
selling these high end

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
buildings in New York.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't selling.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the head of
this corporation

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:90%
got some space clearers in.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And those buildings
began turning over.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
don't believe it.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it's
weird, but it works.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So back to your
question, I just need

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to give a little understanding,
because some people might be

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:90%
going, what is space clearing?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: In some cultures,
they use bells, some gongs,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
some salt, sometimes chanting,
sometimes ash, sometimes Native

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
American, that's drumming,
and sage, and smoke.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:90%
People use what they have.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look
at this video here of Denise

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.694 align:middle line:84%
talking about space clearing
and talking about some

00:16:16.694 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of the things that she uses.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Hi, I'm
Denise Linn, and it

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
is an honor and a
delight to have this time

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
to connect with you.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So when would you use
some of these methods

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
learn in these videos?

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever walked into
a room after an argument,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.203 align:middle line:90%
and it feels thick, doesn't it?

00:16:37.203 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're kind of
walking through molasses.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Instantly by using
space clearing methods,

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like I said, I'm
going to show you some,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:90%
you can clear out that energy.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
What about when you
move into a new home?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Do not move into a new home
unless it's been cleared.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if the people
were great, you

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:84%
want to implant your energy,
your intention for the time

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
that you live in that home.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:90%
How about a divorce?

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
When someone has gone
through a divorce,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the energy
can feel really bad.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
You want to cleanse it and
clear it, especially the bed.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And if you can't, get a new bed.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.547 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do space
clearing, a lot of space

00:17:16.547 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
clearing, to clear
out that old energy

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%
to make way for the new energy.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.121 align:middle line:84%
You could also space clear every
morning just when you wake up.

00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
learn about sounds.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Say, you have a bell.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.121 align:middle line:84%
Just walk your bedroom,
or walk the space

00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that you spend the
most amount of time in.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Ring the bell to call in
fresh, new energy for the day.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.506 align:middle line:90%
What about if someone was ill?

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed
when you go into a room

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.338 align:middle line:84%
and someone's been sick
it feels kind of thick?

00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, in terms
of energy, it is thick.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Simply and easily, you
can refresh that room.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's really good for
the person who's ill,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's also good for
you, when you're in there

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:90%
attending to that ill person.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you've got a new job.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Space clearing.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a new
energy for a new cycle.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone passed
on, someone in your home,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:84%
or a friend, or a family, and
there's kind of a sadness.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Space clear, especially if it's
someone who was in your home.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, this helps them
move to the light.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.116 align:middle line:84%
This helps them keep
from being stuck here.

00:18:17.116 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's been a birth.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You definitely want to
space clear the entire home

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
when a baby's been born,
because you want to create

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:90%
a new energy for this new life.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So those are some
things and times

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that you do want to do
some space clearing.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, growing
up, I never imagined

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be here talking to you
about something in the mind,

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit field.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But I had an experience
when I was 17 that

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:90%
dramatically changed my life.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, before this, my
parents were scientists.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.667 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm Native
American on my mother's side,

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
she was more interested in the
political rights for her people

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:90%
than she was the spirituality.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 17, I went
out on my little motorbike.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
We lived in the farming
community in Ohio.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst
to me, I was being

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
followed by a man in a car.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
He rammed into my
motorbike on purpose,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and as I was on the side
of the road, he came back

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and he shot me.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I was found by
someone passing by,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and eventually taken
to the hospital.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the hospital,
there was a point where

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:90%
the doctors said I'd died.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I remember what happened.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I remember leaving
my body, and going

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
into this amazing
realm of light,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and music, and most of all love.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It was so familiar.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It made my life up to that
point seem like an illusion,

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:90%
because that was the reality.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I saw and understood that
everything was energy.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We are not separate from
the world around us.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
That in every moment we
are influencing and being

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:90%
influenced by that energy.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a moment-- I
didn't want to come back--

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
but there was a moment
when I heard a voice.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And the voice told me
I had to come back.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And I got kind of yanked back.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I was homesick.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to come
back from that place.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Got yanked back into my body.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And my body was really damaged.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I lost a kidney, a
spleen, an adrenal gland.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
There's still a hole
through my spine.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Part of my lung was removed,
my stomach, my intestines.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I was told I would
never have children.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of damage was done.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But I believed
that the activation

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding of energy
that occurred on the other side

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.199 align:middle line:90%
allowed me to heal very quickly.

00:20:44.199 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I got back, I
started to talk to people

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.136 align:middle line:90%
about what I had experienced.

00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, it
was the drugs you were.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.401 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find
anybody I could talk

00:20:52.401 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to you about what had happened,
anyone who even believed me.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:90%
So I quit talking about it.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.465 align:middle line:84%
And then I met a woman who
was a kahuna, a kahuna.

00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
A Hawaiian kahuna.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Kahuna's like an expert.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
But she was a healing kahuna.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time when
I talked about energy, when

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I talked about that I could
hear the grasses sing,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I could see colors around
people and objects,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:90%
this was normal to her.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
This was natural to her.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And she taught me what I
came to call space clearing.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a word I originated.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And now it's become
ubiquitous in the field.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And through her, and through
understanding and working

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
with space clearing, the pain of
my childhood begin to release.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
That feeling of being
isolated, being not connected

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:90%
to the world, began to dissolve.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that this was
something that not only could I

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:84%
use in my own life
for my own healing,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but it was something
that anybody could use.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, when
people do that,

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and they use that space
clearing and the items,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
have you seen their
entire life clear up,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
or new purposes
found and so forth?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Well, in
no small way, we

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
are defined by
our living spaces.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.765 align:middle line:84%
They can affect the way
we feel about ourselves.

00:22:18.765 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:90%
They can affect our health.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
They can even
affect our finances,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at feng shui.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you clear
a space, simply

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
by using some of
these techniques,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and I love sharing them with
people, because they work,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.862 align:middle line:90%
it feels different.

00:22:33.862 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Someone will walk in and
say, what's different?

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Did you paint the wall
a different color?

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And energy, though you
cannot see it, is real.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:90%
It's palpable.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
If you start to feel like, oh,
my house doesn't feel good,

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you had some visitors,
and they left and like,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel so good.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes that's true.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.867 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there's something
called predecessor energy,

00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
which is the energy of the
people that lived in the home

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:90%
before, but residual energy.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
If you've walked into a
room after an argument,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:90%
it can feel thick.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:90%
That's residual energy.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So you've had those
visitors and they leave,

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and maybe things weren't great.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Here's how you can tell
when energy is not uplifted.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Corners won't look sharp.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Colors don't look crisp.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like there's
smoke in the room.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You will feel like you
can't breathe deeply.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:90%
The room will seem even smaller.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few
things that you can do.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
One, is you want to
go to the entrance.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And people say, I don't
want to invest in a tool.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:90%
You've got your hands.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Sound has been used around
the world for clearing.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So you stand at the
entrance to the room,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like you're
allowing your awareness

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to fill the room.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And call your ancestors.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Call spirit guides.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Call angels.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Call for spiritual help.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then see, sense, imagine
the room filled with light.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly begin to
circle the room, and you clap.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And the clap sounds
muted, like this,

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm exaggerating,
that usually

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:90%
means it's not clear energy.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep clapping
until it's crisp.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same with the bell.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If the bell sounds muted that's
probably, stagnant energy.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And once this bell is crisp
and clear, then it's good.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And you keep doing the entire
circumference of the room

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
until you come back
to where you started.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.492 align:middle line:84%
And then it should
feel really good.

00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, have to do a
little bit more, if there's--

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it because of
the frequency of the sound,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:84%
or is it the intention
that you set in the air?

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: If you just
clap in a room,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
make much difference.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, right.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: But if you clap with
the intention of clarity--

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.054 align:middle line:84%
in ancient China,
they understood

00:24:52.054 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:90%
the power of clapping.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So after a performance,
they wouldn't

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
clap, because if it was
powerful and moving,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to take
that energy with them.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't clap,
because by clapping,

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.572 align:middle line:90%
you dissipate the energy.

00:25:04.572 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:90%
That makes so much sense.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip we have
here, you're beating this drum.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of experience
with drumming, don't you?

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Yeah, I'm a drum
maker, and a drum painter,

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.192 align:middle line:84%
and I love drumming
for so many reasons.

00:25:20.192 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
think about it, when

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
we're in the womb, the very
first sound we hear is that.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:90%
It's the heartbeat.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's that rhythm.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.087 align:middle line:84%
And the drum beat can
connect you to all rhythms.

00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Because everything has a rhythm.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it's so beautiful.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a beautiful--
take a look here

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
at Denise Linn with
her beautiful drum.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: One of the things
I love is the drum.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm a drum maker.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
My husband's a drum maker.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We're taught drum making
workshops around the world.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many reasons
why I love the drum.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in pretty
much all native culture,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:90%
they have some form of the drum.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's the idea, it's
that primordial sound,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.382 align:middle line:90%
that primordial beat.

00:26:05.382 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Also, it's interesting.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have found that it
actually changes brain waves.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
There's particular
beats, shamanic beats,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that
change brain waves.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Every native culture uses
the drum for space clearing.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, some
cultures, they say,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
the male, the female, the
grandmother, the grandfather,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
when you bring them
together, you create power,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:90%
you create harmony.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Drums are great.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Anytime there's dense
energy, oh my god, there's

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
dense energy here.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Use a drum.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It will clear it out.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know how to drum,
start with the heart beat.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Dissolve yourself
into that sound.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then allow that
spirit within you

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:90%
to begin to take over.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And don't say, oh, that's
bad, or that's good.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Or don't try to do
a particular beat.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
The space will know
the beat that it needs.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The person will know the
beat that he or she needs.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You'll know the
beat that you need

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.965 align:middle line:90%
for a particular balancing.

00:27:09.965 --> 00:27:21.172 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You can also move
the drum like that.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.278 align:middle line:84%
Just direct it, like you
did with the other tools.

00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you use a drum that
is made from an animal hide,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
it is essential that you
go on an inner journey

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:90%
to find that particular animal.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Now it's in spirit.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:90%
And you give thanks.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You say, I will
honor you forever.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:43.834 align:middle line:90%
And the same for the ring.

00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It's made out of wood.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Find that tree in
the realm of spirit.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Give thanks.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
This thanks is very important.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, with all your tools,
when you're not using them,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:90%
cherish them.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The more you cherish
your tools, the more

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
they're going to work for you.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I love your use of
sound, of space clearing,

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.260 align:middle line:84%
of clearing back into
your ancestral patterns

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:90%
in order to really clear.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking a
lot about clearing.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
going forward a little

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
into the future of creating.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of your
tips, and tools, and techniques

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.213 align:middle line:90%
for creating into the future?

00:28:24.213 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I have so many--

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So many.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, yes.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: OK, here's a great tip.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It is project yourself
one year into the future,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and then write a letter,
maybe to your best friend.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Write a letter as if that
year has already happened.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
remembering it forward.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
You write all the great
things, or you can even

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
get together with
your friend and act

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:90%
as if it's already happened.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's so powerful,
because when

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
someone believes in your
dream, it's like, oh, yeah.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I remember when that happened.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I remember when you met him.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was so great.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:90%
I remember how excited you were.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:90%
That is powerful.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Affirmations work.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They work, because they
reprogram your subconscious

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.787 align:middle line:84%
And so simply just saying, I'm
strong, I'm strong, I'm strong,

00:29:16.787 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to do anything.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It's when you say it
with passion, and belief,

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:90%
and you use your body.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I am strong.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I am strong!

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Change the emphasis.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And to feel it, the more you can
use your voice and your body,

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:84%
it anchors it deep
inside of you,

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes your new
reality rather than, I'm weak,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:90%
or everyone's stronger than me.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.326 align:middle line:84%
It becomes your new
reality by affirmations.

00:29:42.326 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, you
have these great images,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that if you gaze into
them, they can actually

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:90%
take you to a different place.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
These are portals
that you've created.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.016 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show
you one of them now.

00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:90%
This is the healing portal.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:10%
I have something very
similar to this in my office.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:10%
So how does it work?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LINN: This is on my website.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:10%
And for years, I
was a technophobe.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I blew up my first computer.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.209 align:middle line:84%
The first time I touched
a computer, it blew up,

00:30:09.209 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
smoke and everything, because I
the whole thing intimidated me.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And then Facebook and
websites, it intimidated me.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But then I heard this voice say,
cyberspace can be sacred space.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And I felt that to be so.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.865 align:middle line:84%
So I created this
healing portal.

00:30:28.865 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It's on my website,
deniselynn.com.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:10%
It's free.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:10%
And you go to it, and
if you need healing,

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:10%
you turn the sound on.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:10%
And I work specifically
with this image.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
There are healers around the
world sending daily energy

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:90%
into this portal.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can open it up
to receive that energy.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel like it, and
you're in a healing space,

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:90%
put healing energy into it.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Every week, I hear
from people that

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
say, I don't know what I'd do
without that healing portal,

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%
that mystic healing portal.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I felt myself being healed.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Some people leave it on all day.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
They just turn the sound on.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people say
they see images appear,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.257 align:middle line:90%
which I just love that.

00:31:06.257 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
l haven't seen the images,
but so many people say,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:90%
I saw an angel.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And I saw God.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And I saw-- I'm like, really?

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have the directions
below them on how to send

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and how to receive?

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: Yes, it's
all very clear.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:90%
It's on deniselynn.com.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystic healing portal.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I love it, because
so many people don't have

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:90%
the finances to go to a healer.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's free, and it's
available for everybody.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And if someone is
a healer, I really

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
invite them to come
and put energy into it.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, what's the
difference between the healing

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:90%
portals and chakra portal?

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I Have another one here
that says chakra portal.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:10%
>>LINN: Well, I also
have my website,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:10%
have what I call chakra portals.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.630 align:middle line:10%
And I work very
specifically with a designer

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:10%
to come up with the images, and
I always work very specifically

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:10%
for sound.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And the body has these energy
centers called chakras.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:10%
And it's not like we have
little balls of color,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.150 align:middle line:10%
but each chakra, each of these
energy centers on the body

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:10%
has a vibration.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration has
a sound association

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:90%
and a color association.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
out of balance, it

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:90%
can be reflected in that chakra.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So on the website, it has
lists of all different kinds

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:90%
of conditions.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're depressed,
if your blood concerns,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:84%
if your bones are hurt, it's
got all kinds of conditions.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you can look
up and see which chakra

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:90%
might need some balancing.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So you open up
that chakra-- it's

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
so important to turn
the sound on-- and just

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:90%
breathe deeply in and out.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And the one that you
have up on there,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:90%
that's for the crown chakra.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: And that one,
it's just to open you

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:84%
to those higher energies,
open you to intuition.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if your intuition
is not working,

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
or you don't feel
very connected,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and you just feel
like life is mundane,

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:84%
this can help open you to those
higher thoughts, those higher

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's fun, and it's free.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I love, love
being able to support

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.935 align:middle line:90%
people, and especially--

00:33:02.935 --> 00:33:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At any level.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: At any level.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have a new book

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:90%
out that's absolutely beautiful.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: I do.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: "Kindling
The Native Spirit."

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.169 align:middle line:10%
And tell me about it.

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You were really excited
about the practices

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:90%
you've been making.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.032 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: I am actually
really excited.

00:33:18.032 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:10%
It just came out a
few days ago, and I've

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.600 align:middle line:10%
worked on it for years.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:10%
And it contains a
distillation of what

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:10%
I discovered on those journeys
around the world, spending

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:10%
time in native cultures.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
is it's information

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.705 align:middle line:84%
that is so valuable
for us today.

00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:39.374 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.374 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Native isn't necessarily
what's in your blood.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It's what is in your soul.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of our ancestors,
all of our ancestors

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:90%
were native at one point.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And they understood how
to call upon and connect

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to the spirit of the Earth for
healing, and strengthening,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and grounding.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They understood how to listen
to the messages in the cloud,

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's got very
specific information.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, how to make a rattle,
how to make a dream catcher.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But it also has information
that can help each of us

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.772 align:middle line:90%
find our way.

00:34:14.772 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's the
best way of saying it.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.267 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's the first
time ever I wrote a book

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and went, oh my god.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.130 align:middle line:84%
This is actually-- not actually,
but this is really good.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I think, oh I should
have done this or that,

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:90%
but I'm really, really excited.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.429 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: And thank you
for asking me about it.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.489 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's beautiful.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
And I love that even
though I might not

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:84%
have a native heritage, I can
connect into the portals that

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
do connect into the native
heritages, of others

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:90%
or of a universal heritage.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LINN: It's more universal,
and it's also finding

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that native soul within you.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have it, if
we trace our ancestry back.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Fascinating,
fascinating.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And for that knowledge
and permission, in a way,

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to explore
that, and to make it real.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You are such a wonderful, and
friendly, and approachable

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.277 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so
much for joining me.

00:35:08.277 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LINN: Thank you so much.
