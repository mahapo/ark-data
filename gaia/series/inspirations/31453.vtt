>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.725 align:middle line:84%
My guest today has an
extraordinary story

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.561 align:middle line:84%
that if she could make it
through, so could anyone.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Chelsea Roff nearly
died from anorexia,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.134 align:middle line:84%
which caused a stroke
at 15 years old.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:35.336 align:middle line:84%
When she was admitted
to Children's Hospital

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:39.073 align:middle line:84%
at 58 pounds, she pushed
away nearly everything

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:41.475 align:middle line:84%
that was trying to help
her, including food.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.845 align:middle line:84%
And now, six years later,
Chelsea is a yoga instructor

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.516 align:middle line:84%
and lectures around the country
to teens and to caregivers

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:84%
on the fact that
recovery is possible.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.887 align:middle line:84%
Welcome. Thank you
for being here.

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:53.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Thank you.

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:54.822 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here, Lisa.

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So
tell me a little bit

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.359 align:middle line:84%
about your life growing
up, your childhood.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Gosh, I
look back and I think, "Wow,

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.264 align:middle line:84%
I had like five Lifetime
movies rolled into 15 years."

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:04.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Five?

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:05.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Yeah, pretty much.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.768 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And with the
distance, it's - you know,

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.304 align:middle line:84%
you can see it a
little more clearly.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I was born to a lesbian
couple in the heart

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.108 align:middle line:90%
of conservative Texas.

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.443 align:middle line:84%
I was conceived through
artificial insemination,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.646 align:middle line:84%
which was relatively
rare at that point.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.382 align:middle line:84%
My mom had to work really
hard to get inseminated.

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:22.983 align:middle line:84%
She went to like five
different doctors

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and then found one doctor
like four hours away

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.889 align:middle line:84%
who would allow her
to conceive a child.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:30.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:31.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So this
was like 25 years ago.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: This
- yep, about that.

00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.428 align:middle line:90%
About that.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.597 align:middle line:84%
And in Texas, it was really,
you know, just unheard of.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:37.998 align:middle line:90%
So I was born.

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:41.101 align:middle line:84%
My sister was born from the same
donor a couple of years later.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.102 align:middle line:90%
Neither of us know.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.138 align:middle line:90%
It was an anonymous donation.

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:45.706 align:middle line:84%
I've even gone back to
the doctor and asked

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.074 align:middle line:84%
if I could find him
and he says, "No,

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.776 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you you
probably have dozens

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.578 align:middle line:90%
of half-siblings out there."

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, goodness.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Which, when
people say, "That girl looks

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:84%
like she has your nose,"
I'm like, "She might."

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You have an
amazing attitude about it.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.456 align:middle line:84%
Your mom sounds very
strong-willed.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.059 align:middle line:84%
She sounds like the type of
person that would do anything

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:90%
to make something work.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, she was.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.599 align:middle line:84%
And I - I thank her every
day for giving that to me.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.002 align:middle line:84%
I've got friends who call me,
like, the pit bull because I'm -

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.404 align:middle line:84%
I have that fierce
determination.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:22.776 align:middle line:84%
And she was really strong
and I think, as a result,

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:84%
in part because she was a
gay woman and was rejected

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.681 align:middle line:84%
by her own family,
that she was like,

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:31.952 align:middle line:84%
"I am going to do everything and
anything I want to put my mind

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.922 align:middle line:84%
to and I'm not going to
let my being gay stop me."

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So did she run
any of that through you in terms

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:41.195 align:middle line:84%
of making a stand or taking
a stand for your family?

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:42.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.965 align:middle line:84%
She told me when I was
probably four years old

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.735 align:middle line:84%
at our first Gay Pride
Parade that I was going

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.104 align:middle line:84%
to be the Martin Luther
King of the gay people.

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You
remember that at four?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
do, and I carried it

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.444 align:middle line:84%
with me throughout my childhood
and it - you know, I think,

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:84%
at the time, I embraced
it and I was like, "Sure.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.682 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I'm going to
make - you know,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.384 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take a stand."

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:06.253 align:middle line:84%
But I think, especially
in my early teenage years,

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:11.392 align:middle line:84%
I felt a lot of pressure
to be sort of this advocate

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:84%
for my parents and to
wear it on my sleeve

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:18.365 align:middle line:84%
and to take any kind of,
you know, discrimination

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:21.669 align:middle line:84%
or bullying, you
know, myself instead

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.504 align:middle line:84%
of letting it come
off to my mom.

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:27.074 align:middle line:84%
And then I think even - I even
began to resent it, you know.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle line:90%
Like what if I don't want

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:84%
to be the Martin Luther
King of the gay people?

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Of course, right.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:31.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: You know?

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:32.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And say
all of a sudden I want

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.782 align:middle line:84%
to have my own rules
and my own life.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:36.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, now, in what
way did that show up for you?

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
think it instilled in me

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:47.528 align:middle line:84%
from a very early age a sense
of strong social responsibility

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.264 align:middle line:84%
and a commitment
to social justice.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:54.768 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, all throughout
my teenage years I was,

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.704 align:middle line:90%
you know, very up on the news.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.939 align:middle line:84%
I volunteered with Big
Brothers Big Sisters.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.077 align:middle line:84%
I really had a heart for
people who were, you know,

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:07.715 align:middle line:84%
in some ways underserved or
kind of like looked down upon

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.751 align:middle line:84%
in communities because my own
family had sort of been cast

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.455 align:middle line:84%
into the shadows in that
way and I didn't like that.

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:16.156 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt for those
people because I felt

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.025 align:middle line:84%
like my family had
been that way.

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:21.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Did your sister
jump on that bandwagon as well?

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:21.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: No.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:22.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: No?

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
That was you.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
think that was part

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:25.699 align:middle line:84%
of being a first
child with that.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.501 align:middle line:84%
My mom - you know, her
parents when she came

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.003 align:middle line:90%
out of the closet told her,

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:30.938 align:middle line:84%
"You're never going
to have children.

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.506 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to have a family.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:33.807 align:middle line:90%
You're a failure."

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:40.381 align:middle line:84%
And so when - I was in many
ways for my mom the proof

00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.349 align:middle line:90%
that she wasn't a failure.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.521 align:middle line:84%
And so our relationship was
in many ways based on this,

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:50.257 align:middle line:84%
her shaping me into the
person that she wanted

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:51.959 align:middle line:90%
to be, you know, herself.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.763 align:middle line:84%
So - and I think -
I think I came away

00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:57.698 align:middle line:90%
with many gifts from that.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:59.733 align:middle line:84%
You know, like the
fierce - you know,

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:02.669 align:middle line:84%
the fierce determination
[Multiple Speakers].

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.238 align:middle line:90%
The - you know, the heart

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.608 align:middle line:84%
for social justice issues
and minority issues.

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:15.182 align:middle line:84%
But in many ways it confused me
from an early age and I was -

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:17.718 align:middle line:84%
I took a lot more bullying
than my sister did in school

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.987 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't tell anybody
that our parents were gay.

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.022 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Well, yeah,
of course my parents are gay.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:23.891 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a problem
with that?"

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.561 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, I was this - I
was very kind of open about it

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.363 align:middle line:90%
and kids in school were cruel.

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.665 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know, I was gay-wad

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.501 align:middle line:84%
and they played this game
called Smear the Queer.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.903 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:39.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, kids
can be brutal at that age.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.207 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.142 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a picture
of you with your family.

00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:46.513 align:middle line:84%
And so at what point - I saw
you in an interview saying

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:51.017 align:middle line:84%
that you started to use your
body as a way or a message

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.886 align:middle line:90%
that something is going on here.

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.421 align:middle line:90%
Something's going wrong.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:57.024 align:middle line:84%
Exactly how did you
express that?

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I
guess the question underneath

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.396 align:middle line:90%
that is what was going wrong.

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:90%
When I was probably five or six,

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.502 align:middle line:84%
my mom went from being a
relatively healthy individual

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:11.338 align:middle line:90%
to really depending on alcohol

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:14.408 align:middle line:84%
for her emotional
coping mechanisms.

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:19.012 align:middle line:84%
She lost - we lost - her
nephew committed suicide

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:22.216 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's when I
pinpoint alcoholism starting

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:25.052 align:middle line:84%
and it progressively got
worse and worse and worse.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.454 align:middle line:90%
And it got to the point

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:30.357 align:middle line:84%
where she was driving
drunk with us in the car.

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.594 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of violence
in my house between my parents

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:35.362 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
source of unease

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle line:90%
between her and her partner.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.101 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
neglect, so my sister

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:42.903 align:middle line:90%
and I were left at home a lot.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:47.107 align:middle line:84%
And I - what I found
was any time I expressed

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:49.409 align:middle line:90%
to my mom, "I'm scared.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.044 align:middle line:90%
I'm disappointed in you.

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:53.046 align:middle line:84%
You forgot to pick
me up at school.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:55.482 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared when you
drive us drunk.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't trust you.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.452 align:middle line:90%
I need you."

00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:01.321 align:middle line:84%
She would get worse and
she would even threaten

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to commit suicide sometimes.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.496 align:middle line:84%
So I learned from a very early
age that my expression of need

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:17.104 align:middle line:84%
and my expression of emotional
at all verbally was not okay,

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:20.974 align:middle line:84%
was dangerous, and might
even take away the one person

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:24.011 align:middle line:84%
who was most important to me, as
all - you know, for everybody.

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.746 align:middle line:84%
Your mom is the most
important to you.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:28.882 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, I think because of

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:32.619 align:middle line:84%
that I unconsciously learned
that I could not express

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.622 align:middle line:84%
with my words my
emotions or my needs.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.259 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually
I turned to my body

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.695 align:middle line:84%
to express what I
needed to express.

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:43.263 align:middle line:84%
And I think I did
that unconsciously,

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:47.267 align:middle line:84%
but it was like I couldn't
say to Mom, "I'm scared.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.068 align:middle line:90%
I'm unhappy."

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:50.203 align:middle line:90%
But my body could say that.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So where
did you get the ideas

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.708 align:middle line:84%
to start expressing
that through your body?

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.209 align:middle line:90%
How did you turn to anorexia?

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
What started that?

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
That's a good question.

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.713 align:middle line:84%
It certainly wasn't
a conscious choice.

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:00.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: It happened
probably around 11 or 12.

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.688 align:middle line:84%
I was going through puberty just
like every other little girl

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:11.825 align:middle line:90%
and I was emotionally a wreck.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.227 align:middle line:84%
Like I remember - I remember
one moment I was sitting

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.496 align:middle line:84%
in a bathtub and just
started hysterically crying

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.798 align:middle line:90%
for no reason.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.633 align:middle line:84%
And I remember by mom
walking in and being like,

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:20.734 align:middle line:90%
"What is wrong with you?"

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.803 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "I don't know."

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:26.206 align:middle line:84%
You know? And just not being
able to control my emotions.

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in the back
of my mind that my mom

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.779 align:middle line:84%
when she was a kid had struggled
with an eating disorder

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:35.482 align:middle line:84%
and she had a severe
bought of anorexia.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:38.185 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
unhappy with my body,

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.621 align:middle line:90%
as every kid is around puberty.

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:41.287 align:middle line:90%
You know -

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:43.056 align:middle line:84%
It's changing and
you don't know -

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:44.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: It's changing.

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.359 align:middle line:84%
The fat distribution
isn't exactly even.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:46.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You didn't
get a lot of support there.

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:47.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:48.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Did your
mother tell you she had an

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:49.596 align:middle line:90%
eating disorder?

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:50.297 align:middle line:90%
Did she -

00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:50.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: She did.

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: She kind of
wore it as a badge of honor,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.835 align:middle line:90%
like "When I was a kid - "

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:56.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: She
more than told you.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: You know, when
I was a teenager, you know,

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.773 align:middle line:90%
I almost died of anorexia.

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:03.276 align:middle line:84%
Like it was a - it was - she
was in some ways proud of it.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.245 align:middle line:84%
I think more proud
that she had overcome,

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
but it was certainly a source
of kind of pride for her, oddly.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.086 align:middle line:84%
And she still had those eating
habits and was still kind

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.688 align:middle line:90%
of obsessive about her weight.

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.857 align:middle line:90%
And so around that age of 11-12,

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:20.694 align:middle line:84%
when I started expressing
body dissatisfaction

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:21.662 align:middle line:90%
because I certainly wasn't going

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:24.364 align:middle line:84%
to express emotional
dissatisfaction

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:26.133 align:middle line:90%
about what was really going on.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:28.535 align:middle line:84%
So what I did - I think
what most girls learn

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:84%
to do is instead of
saying, "I hate myself,"

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.506 align:middle line:90%
I would say, "I hate my stomach.

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:33.273 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:34.641 align:middle line:90%
I'm fat." You know?

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:84%
I would express all of those
negative emotions with my body

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:41.014 align:middle line:84%
and I think many of
us, women especially,

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
do because that's the
culture we're raised in.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.653 align:middle line:84%
It's permissible to say, you
know, "I have an ugly stomach,"

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:50.457 align:middle line:84%
but it's not permissible
to say, "My heart hurts."

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:51.124 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:51.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:52.893 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: And so I
started expressing those things

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:58.398 align:middle line:84%
to Mom and she said, "Well,
let's go on a diet together."

00:09:58.398 --> 00:09:59.232 align:middle line:90%
You know, "Let's go.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:90%
Let's start a workout routine

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.803 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start eating
healthy together and we'll go

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.237 align:middle line:90%
to the grocery store."

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:06.073 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it being
like, "Oh, my gosh.

00:10:06.073 --> 00:10:08.675 align:middle line:84%
Mom wants to do something
with me.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.677 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
spend time with me."

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I had
been trying so hard

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.683 align:middle line:84%
to get her attention and to
get her to take care of me

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:17.818 align:middle line:90%
and to get that connection.

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.786 align:middle line:90%
And this was - I felt

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:24.725 align:middle line:84%
like dieting was the one way I
was going to get close to her.

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So by saying,
"Look, Mom, this is working

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
for me," you have something
to relate with her about.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.566 align:middle line:84%
It was hopefully going to
give you the connection

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:33.567 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Yeah, and I don't know

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.403 align:middle line:84%
if I was totally conscious
of that at the time,

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:37.571 align:middle line:90%
but that was the feeling.

00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:39.506 align:middle line:90%
It was just this, "Oh, my gosh."

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:42.409 align:middle line:90%
I can't - I think children

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.811 align:middle line:84%
of alcoholics often
have this experience

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.446 align:middle line:84%
that you're spending
time around your parent

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.248 align:middle line:90%
but they're not really there.

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:49.516 align:middle line:90%
They're completely inebriated.

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.785 align:middle line:90%
They're not conscious with you.

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt like maybe -
and this wasn't actually true,

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.057 align:middle line:84%
but maybe this would
be my way of having

00:10:57.057 --> 00:11:00.494 align:middle line:84%
that conscious emotional
connection with her.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And so you
dropped weight rapidly.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I
mean, at first it was just

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.135 align:middle line:84%
like any other diet and I think
this is the way eating disorders

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:12.139 align:middle line:84%
often start, with
teenagers especially.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.507 align:middle line:84%
It just looked like
another diet.

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:14.608 align:middle line:90%
I started cutting out bread.

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.343 align:middle line:84%
I started, you know,
cutting out fat.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.379 align:middle line:84%
Cutting out - but then I
would just keep cutting out

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.982 align:middle line:84%
and Mom eventually was
like, "I'm done with this.

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:22.916 align:middle line:90%
This is way too hard.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.184 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
the gym anymore."

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.586 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Oh,
no, I found something

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.755 align:middle line:90%
that makes me feel good."

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:31.591 align:middle line:84%
I finally found something
that, when I go to school,

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.826 align:middle line:90%
people don't say, "Oh, yeah,

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.661 align:middle line:84%
that's Chelsea who
has gay moms."

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:37.063 align:middle line:84%
It's, "That's Chelsea
who lost like 15 pounds

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:37.731 align:middle line:90%
and looks really good."

00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:39.065 align:middle line:90%
And I was getting -

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That
validation in different ways.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: So much social
validation and outside of that,

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
internally dieting and
obsessing about food

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:56.616 align:middle line:84%
and exercise gave me 1) an
illusion of control over my life

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:59.553 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't really there, but
it was like I could obsess

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.421 align:middle line:84%
about food and calories
and I knew

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.522 align:middle line:90%
that if I ate a certain number

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:04.991 align:middle line:84%
of calories a day,
I would drop weight.

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There was no ifs,
ands, or buts about it.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.561 align:middle line:90%
It was clear.

00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.962 align:middle line:90%
It was controllable.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.197 align:middle line:90%
And I could control my body.

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:11.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, it was
something you could control.

00:12:11.298 --> 00:12:14.334 align:middle line:84%
Wow, you speak for so
many people that get

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.403 align:middle line:84%
into this position
in their lives.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:19.306 align:middle line:84%
So then you kept going with it
and kept going and that will

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:22.809 align:middle line:84%
and determination set in and
you wound up - we have a picture

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:24.978 align:middle line:90%
of you at a very low weight.

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:27.848 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't really
the lowest at this point.

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:28.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: No.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What age
were you in this photo?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
was 13 in that photo.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:33.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Thirteen?

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yep.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.322 align:middle line:90%
That was actually at church.

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.692 align:middle line:84%
I was really involved in the
church when I was younger.

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:42.929 align:middle line:84%
That also came from my mom and
I think that was a few months

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.232 align:middle line:84%
after my first treatment
facility.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So I got down to about - I
probably dropped 40 pounds

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.207 align:middle line:84%
from where I was, passed out
on a marching band field,

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:56.843 align:middle line:84%
and got taken to just
a regular hospital.

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.879 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
was first diagnosed

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.814 align:middle line:84%
with an eating disorder,
diagnosed with anorexia,

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:02.249 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "Go
to a therapist."

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I was in therapy.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What did
your mom do at that time?

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I don't
think my mom really knew how

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:09.522 align:middle line:90%
to handle it.

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:11.758 align:middle line:84%
And she was - she was
really ill by this point.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:16.162 align:middle line:84%
At this point, my mom had -
my parents were separated,

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.532 align:middle line:84%
so my mom and her partner
had separated, so I was alone

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle line:84%
in the house with
Mom and she was -

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.536 align:middle line:90%
she just wasn't present anymore.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:27.674 align:middle line:84%
She was so just taken
by her own demons

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:29.643 align:middle line:84%
and I have compassion
for that now.

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:32.212 align:middle line:84%
But I was kind of
alone in that struggle.

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:33.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Absolutely.

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.482 align:middle line:84%
At 13, when you're going through
that impressionable period

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.183 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
needing support

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.285 align:middle line:90%
in so many different ways,

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:41.121 align:middle line:84%
and you had nothing
there to support you.

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:45.458 align:middle line:84%
So you wound up in the hospital
and at 15 years old you got

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.294 align:middle line:84%
to such a low weight that
you actually had a stroke

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:48.962 align:middle line:90%
from the weight loss.

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:50.764 align:middle line:90%
Was that what it was from?

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:51.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:52.666 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in and
out of hospitals

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.701 align:middle line:90%
from the time I was 13 to 15.

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.671 align:middle line:84%
So I would go away for a month
to a residential facility

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.039 align:middle line:84%
and then I would come
back and get sick again.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.308 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go
away for two months.

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.642 align:middle line:90%
I'd be sent to another facility

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:03.944 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
and get sick again.

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:06.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So why do you
think that wasn't working?

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:07.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well,
it was very clear.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:10.216 align:middle line:84%
So I would go to a
treatment facility

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:84%
and there would be a
structured meal plan,

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.353 align:middle line:84%
there would be doctors
and nurses

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.155 align:middle line:90%
and support groups and therapy.

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:18.825 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so - there
was so much support,

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:20.994 align:middle line:90%
but also there was structure.

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:22.028 align:middle line:90%
There was discipline.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle line:84%
There were consequences
if you didn't -

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.332 align:middle line:90%
there was parenting, you know.

00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:28.668 align:middle line:84%
I was being parented by
these adult residential -

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.437 align:middle line:84%
I was there with
40-year-old women.

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.305 align:middle line:90%
Like there was no one under 18.

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I was the only - and I was 15.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.711 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up really fast, but
I also was parented not just

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.513 align:middle line:84%
by the doctors and nurses
there, but even by other women

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.682 align:middle line:84%
who were struggling
with this illness.

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:45.518 align:middle line:84%
Those are years I actually
look back on fondly.

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:48.655 align:middle line:84%
But I would go back and I'd be
like, "Alright, I'm in recovery.

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:90%
I've got this."

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.626 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go home and it
would be even worse at home

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:58.365 align:middle line:84%
and I would go right back to
starving myself and exercising.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started to
drop weight really rapidly

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
because I would come home
and I'd be so shocked by it.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.606 align:middle line:84%
And by this time - what
happens a lot of time with women

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:08.575 align:middle line:84%
with eating disorders
is they learn tips

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:12.178 align:middle line:84%
and tricks while they're
in hospital and in care

00:15:12.178 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
because you're with all these
other sick people who talk

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.648 align:middle line:84%
about what they did
when they were sick.

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So this
is actually interesting

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:19.619 align:middle line:84%
for parents right
now who have children

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:20.587 align:middle line:90%
who are in this position.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.255 align:middle line:84%
What tips and tricks
did you learn?

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well, I'm
certainly not going to say it

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.159 align:middle line:84%
out loud right now
because I don't want

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:27.594 align:middle line:90%
to give it to anyone else.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:31.564 align:middle line:84%
But for parents, I would
say one of the things I came

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:34.868 align:middle line:84%
across is there's a whole
movement online called

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:38.138 align:middle line:84%
Pro-Anorexia that I heard
about while I was in treatment.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
these websites,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.043 align:middle line:84%
they tell you what
vitamins to taken

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
when you're starving yourself.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.479 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not eating
anything, take these vitamins

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:48.348 align:middle line:90%
and you wont lose your hair.

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:51.317 align:middle line:84%
If you want to lose weight
really, really rapidly,

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:54.087 align:middle line:84%
do this much exercise,
eat this many calories,

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:55.989 align:middle line:84%
and then the next day
do this much exercise.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:16:00.026 align:middle line:84%
So there's structured routines
for starving yourself to death.

00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:84%
And this movement
believes that anorexia

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.298 align:middle line:84%
and any eating disorder
is a choice,

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:09.736 align:middle line:84%
it is a lifestyle choice,
which is such a sick,

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.905 align:middle line:90%
sick, sad perspective.

00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:13.773 align:middle line:90%
And it breaks my heart.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:17.577 align:middle line:84%
And for someone who is in
the beginning of an illness,

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
especially young girls who are
maybe on Pinterest and looking

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.016 align:middle line:84%
at thin-speration
and whatnot, it's -

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:25.351 align:middle line:90%
I think it should be outlawed.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:26.553 align:middle line:90%
Like it's horrible.

00:16:26.553 --> 00:16:28.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That is
amazing that you said that

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.989 align:middle line:84%
and that those types of
groups really believe

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:90%
that they can support that.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Well, unfortunately,

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.829 align:middle line:84%
the people leading these
groups are sick themselves.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:39.833 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's - you know,
I think social media sites

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:44.971 align:middle line:84%
like Pinterest, like Google, all
of these have a responsibility,

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.773 align:middle line:84%
I think, to the larger community
and to children who are

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:51.277 align:middle line:84%
on the Internet to be
regulating these sites.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:52.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I agree.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.146 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.715 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at all
of those social media

00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:58.651 align:middle line:84%
and billboards and
magazines and it's awful.

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:03.389 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's airbrushed
and it's cut and snipped

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.925 align:middle line:84%
and it's definitely not
reality wherever you look.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.628 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it gives a message to us

00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:12.966 align:middle line:84%
that this is what
normal is, and it's not.

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I know.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.268 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard.

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:18.303 align:middle line:84%
And I think when people
ask me - you know,

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:21.773 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I speak about
when I go to universities is,

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:24.511 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, magazines
do not cause eating disorders

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.514 align:middle line:84%
and neither does television
and neither do movies.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:30.483 align:middle line:84%
But what I would say
- so I believe that,

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.986 align:middle line:90%
for me, the - not for me.

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:35.555 align:middle line:84%
I think the evidence
suggests that the causes

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.358 align:middle line:84%
of eating disorders
include genetic factors.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:39.893 align:middle line:84%
So my mom had an
eating disorder.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:44.864 align:middle line:84%
I came with a pre - was
predisposed to addiction

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.866 align:middle line:90%
and to eating disorders.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.835 align:middle line:90%
Early childhood trauma.

00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:50.203 align:middle line:90%
Almost every woman I know

00:17:50.203 --> 00:17:52.906 align:middle line:84%
that has an eating disorder has
struggled with sexual trauma

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.874 align:middle line:90%
at some point in their life

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
or physical trauma
or emotional trauma.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.079 align:middle line:84%
The trauma is the trigger
for an eating disorder.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.749 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a
genetic predisposition,

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:84%
which you can think
of as loading the gun;

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:07.353 align:middle line:90%
trauma pulls the trigger.

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:09.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
then ignites it.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.858 align:middle line:84%
So it's your ultimate need to
get into control again, right?

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:13.993 align:middle line:84%
But here's where
culture comes in.

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:17.864 align:middle line:90%
So I was suffering.

00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:21.768 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling with pain,
with emotional heartbreak,

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:24.437 align:middle line:84%
with not having access
to a parental figure.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.839 align:middle line:90%
I was struggling with trauma.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:28.174 align:middle line:90%
So I believe that our culture

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:31.744 align:middle line:84%
in some ways gives us a
symptom repertoire that -

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:33.613 align:middle line:84%
a culturally appropriate
symptom repertoire.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:37.517 align:middle line:84%
So when you are suffering,
especially with mental illness,

00:18:37.517 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
these are the ways
that we act out pain.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.355 align:middle line:84%
So some of us reach
toward alcohol.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We know that from our culture.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.058 align:middle line:90%
Some of us reach toward dieting.

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:48.928 align:middle line:84%
Some - so when I looked
around at my culture,

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:51.664 align:middle line:84%
what I saw was thin
people in magazines.

00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:53.967 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
first things I reached

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.704 align:middle line:84%
for because my culture
said dieting makes you a

00:18:57.704 --> 00:18:58.938 align:middle line:90%
better person.

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:01.374 align:middle line:84%
You know, losing weight
makes you a stronger person.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:02.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Validates
what you're doing.

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.679 align:middle line:84%
It validated, but it also
- I mean, when I think

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:09.015 align:middle line:90%
about those early moments

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
of really the eating
disorder developing,

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.085 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking about, "Well,

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:14.621 align:middle line:84%
my mom did this when
she did a kid."

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of a way
of feeling close to her

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and then I was looking at the
magazines and there's, you know,

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.964 align:middle line:84%
Nicole Ritchie had lost 50
pounds and blah, blah, blah.

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:26.099 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I mean,
it's a perfect example

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.069 align:middle line:84%
of how children model behavior
of the parents no matter what.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.404 align:middle line:90%
No matter if it's good or bad.

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:33.239 align:middle line:90%
It's just an imprint.

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:36.142 align:middle line:84%
So you got down to this
weight of 58 pounds.

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:41.347 align:middle line:84%
You had a stroke and you would
up in the hospital permanently.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:42.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well, yeah.

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:43.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a long time;
not permanently.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.051 align:middle line:90%
[Multiple speakers]

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:50.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: But you became
a foster in the foster system

00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:54.494 align:middle line:84%
and at the care of
the caregivers there.

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:55.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.663 align:middle line:90%
So I was 15.

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:58.731 align:middle line:84%
It was two weeks
before my 15th birthday.

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.835 align:middle line:84%
I went to - I wanted
to go grocery shopping,

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.838 align:middle line:84%
which I was absolutely
obsessed with, ironically.

00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:08.174 align:middle line:84%
So you would think
anorexics don't want

00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:09.742 align:middle line:90%
to go grocery shopping.

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:11.778 align:middle line:84%
Most people with eating
disorders are obsessed

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:12.979 align:middle line:90%
with food.

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:14.414 align:middle line:84%
They love to cook, they
just don't want to eat it.

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:15.748 align:middle line:84%
They want to go grocery
shopping,

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:18.484 align:middle line:84%
they just don't want
to eat what they buy.

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:22.689 align:middle line:84%
It's a - there's something about
the starved brain that grabs

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:84%
on to anything and
everything about food.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.094 align:middle line:84%
Like I used to read food
blogs for hours on end,

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:30.263 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't eat ever.

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:31.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: So interesting.

00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:33.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, so
it's a very interesting -

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.736 align:middle line:84%
but to continue on, I was at
Whole Foods with my sister.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.939 align:middle line:84%
I remember her actually saying,
"Chelsea, maybe you should sit

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:84%
down on that motorized
grocery cart.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.143 align:middle line:90%
You're on bed rest.

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:45.611 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said you're
not allowed to walk

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.746 align:middle line:90%
around until you gain weight."

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.848 align:middle line:84%
Because I was severely
underweight.

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "No.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That is a cart for handicapped
people and I am not handicapped.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone."

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.423 align:middle line:84%
And so we separated
in the store.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:58.825 align:middle line:90%
I was walking down an aisle.

00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:02.395 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was looking for the
lowest calorie marinara sauce

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:04.931 align:middle line:84%
you could find and they actually
make zero calorie marinara

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:10.603 align:middle line:84%
sauces, believe it or not, and I
was looking for it and I started

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:15.441 align:middle line:84%
to see stars in my right
center - my right visual field.

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.544 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like I was
about to have a migraine,

00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:20.046 align:middle line:84%
like I used to have
migraines when I was a kid.

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:21.314 align:middle line:90%
That's what it felt like.

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle line:84%
And then something weird
happened in my ear, like it felt

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.852 align:middle line:90%
like a change of air pressure.

00:21:25.852 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last thing I
remember, to be honest with you.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:36.129 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any clear memories
of how I got from that store

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:38.531 align:middle line:84%
to Children's Medical
Center in Dallas.

00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:43.269 align:middle line:84%
I believe - I've talked to my
family and caregivers' sons

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:46.873 align:middle line:84%
and I believe my mom's
partner drove me up to Dallas,

00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:49.976 align:middle line:84%
where they had a
special unit for people

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.378 align:middle line:90%
with eating disorders.

00:21:52.378 --> 00:21:54.747 align:middle line:84%
And she thought that was
all I needed was eating

00:21:54.747 --> 00:21:56.182 align:middle line:90%
disorder treatment.

00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:59.185 align:middle line:84%
And I got there, they sat
me down in a wheelchair,

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:03.322 align:middle line:84%
they took me to the Psychiatry
Unit, and the doctor on staff,

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:08.494 align:middle line:84%
who later became actually
my legal guardian -

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.229 align:middle line:90%
he took one look at me and said,

00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:11.931 align:middle line:84%
"She is not coming
on to my unit.

00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:15.001 align:middle line:90%
She is a legal risk.

00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:18.104 align:middle line:84%
You send her up to
cardiology right now."

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:21.407 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they found
out that I had had the stroke.

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:25.645 align:middle line:84%
They put me on telemetry,
which monitors the valves

00:22:25.645 --> 00:22:28.815 align:middle line:84%
of your heart and makes sure
you're - and I was - I mean,

00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:31.517 align:middle line:84%
every organ system in my body
was shutting down at that point.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:32.885 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember.

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:35.455 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't find out that
I was up on the Cardiac Unit

00:22:35.455 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
until several months
ago when I was talking

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Wooten, my doctor.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:40.827 align:middle line:90%
I was like, "Well, you know,

00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:42.195 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
day being this."

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:44.997 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, "Oh, no, you
were on the Cardiology Unit

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:46.999 align:middle line:84%
for two weeks before I
let you onto my unit."

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:49.435 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember any of being
out for those two weeks.

00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:50.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, my goodness.

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:53.973 align:middle line:84%
So when you were there
and you started to recover

00:22:53.973 --> 00:22:56.943 align:middle line:84%
and you started to gain a little
bit more weight and gain -

00:22:56.943 --> 00:23:01.981 align:middle line:84%
did you repair in terms of the
mental damage that was done?

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:03.149 align:middle line:90%
Or was there any?

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:04.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Well, it was slow.

00:23:04.851 --> 00:23:08.421 align:middle line:84%
So I'm fully physically
recovered right now.

00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:13.559 align:middle line:84%
I'm - every single system in my
body seems to have, you know,

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:17.363 align:middle line:84%
come back with that fierce
will and determination.

00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:20.333 align:middle line:84%
The first few weeks I
was in the hospital,

00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:22.568 align:middle line:84%
I think they were just trying to
figure out what to do with me.

00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
When I talked to them
now, they were like,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
"Who is this poor sick child
and can we keep her alive?"

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.244 align:middle line:84%
I remember my cardiologist,
you know - I was like,

00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:32.245 align:middle line:90%
"I'm going to go home tomorrow.

00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:33.412 align:middle line:84%
My mom's going to
come pick me up.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:34.313 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any insurance.

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:35.314 align:middle line:90%
You can't keep me here."

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:36.749 align:middle line:90%
And she'd be like, "I don't know

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:39.018 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
be alive tomorrow.

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my best."

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:42.155 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:42.955 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:44.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I do.

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:44.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Did you
struggle with them?

00:23:44.957 --> 00:23:46.058 align:middle line:90%
Did you fight with them?

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:48.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: I was so mad.

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:51.898 align:middle line:84%
I was - it was the first time
in probably two or three years

00:23:51.898 --> 00:23:53.833 align:middle line:84%
that I had an emotion
because I was

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.668 align:middle line:84%
so numb during my
eating disorder.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:24:00.072 align:middle line:84%
That was probably why
starving was such a -

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Gratifying.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah,
such a gratifying and kind

00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:05.745 align:middle line:84%
of addictive mechanism because
it kept the emotions away.

00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:07.046 align:middle line:90%
But I was angry.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I was really mad to be there
and a few weeks in, they -

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.854 align:middle line:84%
the doctors called Child
Protective Services on my mom.

00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
A caseworker went to my home
and very, very quickly decided

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.197 align:middle line:84%
that it was not a safe place
for my sister or I to be in.

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:84%
My sister was put in foster
care and she went to live

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:31.003 align:middle line:84%
with my godparents and the
doctors at the hospital,

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:33.406 align:middle line:84%
and this is probably a
month after me being there,

00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:35.508 align:middle line:90%
were given guardianship of me.

00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:37.977 align:middle line:84%
So I became a ward
of the hospital.

00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:39.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: A resident?

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:40.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:24:40.413 --> 00:24:42.748 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they literally -
I was on - fortunately,

00:24:42.748 --> 00:24:46.218 align:middle line:84%
when you go into the foster care
system, you're given Medicaid,

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:49.322 align:middle line:84%
which is free state
healthcare basically.

00:24:49.322 --> 00:24:52.224 align:middle line:84%
I - actually I've had
somebody say, "Oh,

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you basically mooched off of
state healthcare," and I'm like,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.531 align:middle line:84%
"Absolutely, I did, and I
will be the poster child

00:24:58.531 --> 00:25:00.466 align:middle line:90%
for Medicaid if you'd like."

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:01.867 align:middle line:90%
It saved my life.

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It saved
your life, absolutely.

00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:04.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:25:04.904 --> 00:25:06.272 align:middle line:84%
Most people with
eating disorders who go

00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:09.375 align:middle line:84%
to treatment get cut off by
insurance if they get in,

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.077 align:middle line:84%
if the insurance company
even approves them,

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:14.146 align:middle line:84%
and usually insurance
companies will not.

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:15.414 align:middle line:90%
They'll pull the plug.

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:19.452 align:middle line:84%
They'll get in there for
maybe a month, maybe 30 days.

00:25:19.452 --> 00:25:22.054 align:middle line:84%
They'll just get to like
a weight restoration place

00:25:22.054 --> 00:25:23.356 align:middle line:90%
and then they're sent home.

00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:24.557 align:middle line:90%
And so when you're asked,

00:25:24.557 --> 00:25:26.592 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you think you went
back to your behaviors?"

00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:29.462 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a strong
foundation of recovery.

00:25:29.462 --> 00:25:32.198 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have enough of
a foundation to go home

00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:35.768 align:middle line:84%
into the chaos of my household
and not get sick again.

00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So how
long did you live there?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I was
there almost 18 months.

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:41.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:41.941 align:middle line:90%
Over a year?

00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:43.776 align:middle line:90%
So you had your 16th birthday.

00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:46.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I had my
16th and 17th birthdays there.

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:47.513 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
my 16th birthday,

00:25:47.513 --> 00:25:49.115 align:middle line:90%
but I do remember my 17th.

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:50.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So you had - did you - what
was life like there for you?

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: The first
six months were agonizing.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.258 align:middle line:90%
I hated everything about it.

00:25:59.258 --> 00:26:00.059 align:middle line:90%
I hated them.

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:01.127 align:middle line:90%
I hated me.

00:26:01.127 --> 00:26:07.133 align:middle line:84%
I wanted - frankly,
I wanted to die.

00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:12.271 align:middle line:84%
I think when I finally
got there and realized

00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that my attempt had
been thwarted,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.843 align:middle line:84%
like my slow suicide
attempt, this slow starvation,

00:26:17.843 --> 00:26:20.713 align:middle line:90%
and I was really delusional.

00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:23.249 align:middle line:84%
When you get down to
that low of a weight,

00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
your brain does very
funny things.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.019 align:middle line:84%
I was having hallucinations
before I got in.

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:30.589 align:middle line:84%
I - to be honest with you,
and I - you know, this is -

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.525 align:middle line:84%
it makes me self-conscious
to share this,

00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:33.926 align:middle line:90%
but I think it's important, too,

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
because I know there are other
people who struggle with this.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.965 align:middle line:90%
I had religious delusions.

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:42.668 align:middle line:84%
I believed that God wanted
me to kill myself and that

00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:45.871 align:middle line:84%
that was my martyrdom
and that was my way

00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:84%
of being the Martin Luther
King of the gay people was

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
of being the person
who killed herself.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.315 align:middle line:84%
So when I got there
- when you asked

00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:58.184 align:middle line:84%
about how those first
six months were,

00:26:58.184 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
I was still pretty
delusional and I was sick and,

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:04.824 align:middle line:84%
at that point, I was
like, "I want to die

00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and you leave me alone.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.828 align:middle line:90%
Let me die in peace."

00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:12.998 align:middle line:84%
I hated the doctors and I had
been taken away from my mom.

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:16.435 align:middle line:84%
So this maybe surprising,
but I didn't hate my mom.

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I loved her very much.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.438 align:middle line:90%
I was very worried about her.

00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:20.206 align:middle line:90%
She was at home.

00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:22.108 align:middle line:90%
She was drinking.

00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I was worried about my sister.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.277 align:middle line:90%
I was all alone.

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:27.146 align:middle line:90%
I felt completely isolated.

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.148 align:middle line:84%
I was in a wheelchair
for the first six months.

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:31.751 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk by myself.

00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:34.153 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in the shower
at one point and them putting me

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.155 align:middle line:84%
in a chair in the shower and
them saying, "Don't move."

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:37.656 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the
lady walked away,

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.925 align:middle line:84%
I tried to stand
up and I fainted.

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.761 align:middle line:90%
Like I didn't have my body,

00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.163 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have my
family, I had nothing.

00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:46.098 align:middle line:90%
I wanted nothing.

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What advice
could you offer the caregivers

00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:53.038 align:middle line:84%
who are dealing with people
that were in or that are

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:90%
in your situation back then?

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.177 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what - when they're
giving every single day

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.814 align:middle line:84%
and coming back every single day
and getting a lot of resistance

00:28:01.814 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and fighting, what
do you tell them now?

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
That's a great question.

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:14.827 align:middle line:84%
I go and I speak now at
treatment facilities,

00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:16.395 align:middle line:84%
whether it be an eating
disorder treatment center

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:18.998 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it's just
counseling centers,

00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and I've made it kind of a
mission over the past year

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.804 align:middle line:84%
to talk to people,
therapists specifically,

00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:26.972 align:middle line:84%
who work with people
with eating disorders.

00:28:26.972 --> 00:28:29.275 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
that I saw when I walk

00:28:29.275 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:84%
in the door is, "Thank you
on behalf of every patient

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:84%
and cannot and may - if
you are listening right now

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:39.285 align:middle line:84%
and you are a therapist,
thank you so much.

00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for not
giving up on us.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.591 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for doing what you do,
for the thankless work you do,"

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:49.895 align:middle line:84%
because it's a difficult illness
to treat and oftentimes -

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:53.032 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a therapist of
seven years and, fortunately,

00:28:53.032 --> 00:28:55.334 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in touch with
her and can thank her.

00:28:55.334 --> 00:29:00.673 align:middle line:84%
But often times you never see
the other side of this illness.

00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:04.176 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times therapists
will treat someone for two years

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.779 align:middle line:84%
and they go off to treatment
and they never see them again

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:10.616 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know if what
they said - your words matter,

00:29:10.616 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:84%
your work matters, and
you're saving lives.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: When you say that
to them, do they break down?

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:19.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: They cry.

00:29:19.325 --> 00:29:20.559 align:middle line:90%
And I cry.

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.728 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I'm holding
it together right now okay,

00:29:22.728 --> 00:29:29.401 align:middle line:84%
but I cry because I don't
get to - I almost feel

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.571 align:middle line:84%
like when I connect with
caregivers who are working

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:35.074 align:middle line:84%
with this illness,
I'm connecting

00:29:35.074 --> 00:29:36.709 align:middle line:90%
with the people who helped me.

00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:38.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You're
connecting with the people -

00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:40.112 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: The
people who helped me.

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:44.049 align:middle line:84%
So those - there's probably a
dozen nurses I have not seen

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:45.651 align:middle line:84%
since my time in the
hospital I have no way

00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.319 align:middle line:90%
to get into contact with.

00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:50.155 align:middle line:84%
But when I sit down with a nurse
who's treating someone who is

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in my place right now, it's my
way of thinking Nurse Connie,

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.095 align:middle line:90%
Nurse Sophia, you know.

00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:59.398 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just such a
beautiful experience and I think

00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:00.799 align:middle line:90%
for them it's beautiful to hear

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
from someone who's reached
the other side for them

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:07.673 align:middle line:84%
to see there is hope,
your work does matter.

00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:12.044 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's such
a blessing to be able

00:30:12.044 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to honor the people
who do this work.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: It's huge.

00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:16.882 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely huge.

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:18.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, CNN got a hold
of your story

00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
and they shot a beautiful piece.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.555 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a look at this.

>> Sanjay Gupta: When you see
Chelsea Roff now looking happy

00:30:28.627 --> 00:30:30.629 align:middle line:84%
and vibrant, it's
nearly impossible

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:33.933 align:middle line:84%
to imagine the day she says
a part of her brain died.

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:36.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: It felt
like a change in air pressure

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:38.537 align:middle line:84%
in the room, like something
happened in my ears.

00:30:38.537 --> 00:30:41.106 align:middle line:84%
Like it was almost like if
you're going up in a plane

00:30:41.106 --> 00:30:43.776 align:middle line:84%
and you feel your ear,
like your auditory sense,

00:30:43.776 --> 00:30:46.211 align:middle line:84%
kind of change a
little bit, I felt that.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:49.048 align:middle line:84%
And then I paused and that's
the last thing I remember.

00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:52.651 align:middle line:84%

suffered a stroke brought

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.321 align:middle line:90%
on by her severe anorexia.

00:30:55.321 --> 00:31:00.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: By the
time I was almost 16,

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.861 align:middle line:84%
I was at a dangerously
low weight.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I know now from looking

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.166 align:middle line:84%
at hospital records
that I was 58 pounds.

00:31:07.166 --> 00:31:10.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Sanjay Gupta: Fifty-eight
pounds and so close to dying

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:13.138 align:middle line:84%
because many parts of
her body were failing.

00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:16.008 align:middle line:84%
There are no pictures
of Roff at her sickest.

00:31:16.008 --> 00:31:18.777 align:middle line:84%

and out of treatment centers.

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:23.282 align:middle line:84%
But she remembers how starting
a diet with her mom in the midst

00:31:23.282 --> 00:31:26.852 align:middle line:84%
of a difficult and sometimes
dangerous childhood spiraled

00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:29.321 align:middle line:84%
into a disorder that
nearly killed her.

I think my body was my only way

00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:34.593 align:middle line:84%
to tell the people around me
that something wasn't okay

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:36.762 align:middle line:84%
and that I was scared
and that I was hurting

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I had nurses and
doctors that showed

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.175 align:middle line:84%
up every day and
were consistent.

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:55.881 align:middle line:84%
And I had food and I had water
and I was finally getting, like,

00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:57.916 align:middle line:90%
digestive function back.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.051 align:middle line:90%
I was getting all those things.

00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I had
real ground beneath me.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.056 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have an eating disorder
providing a false ground

00:32:04.056 --> 00:32:04.757 align:middle line:90%
beneath me.

I had earth beneath me.

00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:08.394 align:middle line:84%
And with that I could
learn to walk again.

00:32:08.394 --> 00:32:10.596 align:middle line:84%
And with that I could
learn to live again.

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.364 align:middle line:90%
And with that I could recover.

>> Sanjay Gupta: As
part of her recovery,

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:16.969 align:middle line:84%
her therapist suggested Roff
try yoga to start listening

00:32:16.969 --> 00:32:19.972 align:middle line:84%
to her body again without
burning too many calories.

00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:22.374 align:middle line:84%
And almost immediately
she was hooked.

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:26.145 align:middle line:84%
Time on her mat helped her gain
confidence, learn to interact

00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:84%
with people, and slowly
change her personality.

it, I'd gained 20-30 pounds

00:32:31.717 --> 00:32:35.421 align:middle line:84%
and had done a yoga teacher
training and was teaching yoga

00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:40.125 align:middle line:84%
in a juvenile detention
center and it became sort

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.094 align:middle line:90%
of a love affair for me.

00:32:42.094 --> 00:32:42.961 align:middle line:90%
My name's Chelsea.

00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:90%

I tell these girls that I am
not afraid of my fullness.

out that yoga is not
a cure for anything;

00:33:20.933 --> 00:33:24.036 align:middle line:84%
it's one of only many tools
that, when used correctly,

00:33:24.036 --> 00:33:25.904 align:middle line:90%
helped her rebuild her life.

tell you your particular way

out of the well, but I can
share with you something

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.346 align:middle line:84%
that was really, really helpful
for me and maybe be a beacon

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:37.649 align:middle line:84%
of hope that you can have
your life back fully.

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:38.951 align:middle line:84%
[ Background noise] You can
live in your body fully.

00:33:38.951 --> 00:33:40.185 align:middle line:90%
You can have happiness.

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:43.288 align:middle line:84%
And that's, for me,
the biggest thing.

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:90%
[ Background noise ]

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.759 align:middle line:84%

Gupta, CNN, reporting.

[ Applause ]

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:54.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So who got
you involved in yoga?

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:57.369 align:middle line:90%
How did you start that aspect.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:01.273 align:middle line:84%
And we're going back
to the hospital now.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:02.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah.

00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:04.376 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think there
was a yoga teacher once

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:05.477 align:middle line:90%
or twice in the hospital.

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I certainly did not
have-want anything to do

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.081 align:middle line:90%
with it at that point.

00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.417 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out of
the hospital, I was 17.

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:15.521 align:middle line:84%
I moved into a garage
apartment right next

00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:17.089 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital to stay close.

00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:18.856 align:middle line:90%
I was out on my own.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.593 align:middle line:84%
I enrolled in college
really quickly

00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:24.563 align:middle line:84%
because I'd gotten my high
school diploma while I was

00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.765 align:middle line:90%
I did distance education.

00:34:26.765 --> 00:34:32.804 align:middle line:84%
And thank - you know,
thank whatever is up there

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:35.140 align:middle line:84%
that there was a -
there was a therapist

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.542 align:middle line:84%
that I had known
at the hospital.

00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:39.111 align:middle line:84%
She was getting her - she was
doing her internship while I was

00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:40.612 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital, so
she was an intern.

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:43.148 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out,
I needed therapy.

00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:44.483 align:middle line:90%
I was not done.

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:46.351 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is part of
what insurance companies don't

00:34:46.351 --> 00:34:49.354 align:middle line:84%
understand is treatment
for anorexia,

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:52.124 align:middle line:90%
probably five years minimum.

00:34:52.124 --> 00:34:54.959 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't happen just like
that, so you've got inpatient

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:57.029 align:middle line:84%
and then there needs to
be outpatient therapy.

00:34:57.029 --> 00:34:58.096 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any money.

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.565 align:middle line:90%
I was completely on my own.

00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get into
college on loans and grants.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have a
GPA to send to schools

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.504 align:middle line:84%
because I had done
distance education.

00:35:05.504 --> 00:35:06.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Did you
have to get a job?

00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes, I
was working at Starbucks.

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:12.277 align:middle line:84%
And I walked to Starbucks
to get to Starbucks

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:13.712 align:middle line:90%
and I rode the train to go

00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:16.081 align:middle line:84%
to outpatient therapy
at the hospital.

00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:17.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well,
you had a routine.

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:18.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
did, and that was -

00:35:18.417 --> 00:35:19.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
a source of income.

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: That
was so important.

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.721 align:middle line:90%
Minimum wage, but it was enough.

00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:23.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:25.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: So
there was this therapist

00:35:25.324 --> 00:35:28.594 align:middle line:84%
that she had just
gotten her Ph.D.,

00:35:28.594 --> 00:35:29.928 align:middle line:90%
was starting her own practice.

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:31.263 align:middle line:90%
I had known her in the hospital.

00:35:31.263 --> 00:35:33.398 align:middle line:84%
She'd been very involved in
my treatment and she said,

00:35:33.398 --> 00:35:36.835 align:middle line:84%
"Chelsea, I'd like to
offer you free therapy."

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:40.005 align:middle line:84%
And at first we bartered,
like I would bring her, like,

00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:44.142 align:middle line:84%
bags of coffees from
Starbucks to pay for my therapy

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.211 align:middle line:84%
and then I would pay her,
you know, maybe $10.00

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.548 align:middle line:84%
or $15.00 a week, which,
you know, she was - she -

00:35:49.548 --> 00:35:52.217 align:middle line:84%
her rates were $175.00
a session.

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:90%
This was a gift.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.422 align:middle line:90%
And she gave me weekly therapy

00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:59.258 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
twice weekly therapy.

00:35:59.258 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
When my mom got sick,
I needed that level.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.195 align:middle line:90%
Probably -

00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:04.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And you
got to talk to someone.

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:06.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I
got to talk to somebody

00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:09.401 align:middle line:84%
and that was helpful and
she knew that was helpful.

00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:12.838 align:middle line:84%
But what she picked up on about
three or four months out was

00:36:12.838 --> 00:36:17.242 align:middle line:84%
that I could talk my way in
and out of every emotion.

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:20.212 align:middle line:84%
But if I wasn't feeling
them in my body, nothing -

00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:22.447 align:middle line:84%
no healing was going
to take place.

00:36:22.447 --> 00:36:24.616 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
disconnected from my body.

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:25.951 align:middle line:90%
I had a meal plan.

00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:28.854 align:middle line:84%
It was 600 calories in the
morning, 300 calories for snack,

00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:31.189 align:middle line:90%
and I followed that to a "T,"

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.791 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't eat
with other people.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:36.461 align:middle line:84%
I was ashamed of letting
anyone see me eat.

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:38.163 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be a normal
social person.

00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:39.464 align:middle line:90%
I had no friends.

00:36:39.464 --> 00:36:41.833 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Chelsea, I
think you need to reconnect

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.336 align:middle line:84%
with your body and I
think yoga might be a way

00:36:44.336 --> 00:36:45.671 align:middle line:90%
for you to do that."

00:36:45.671 --> 00:36:49.408 align:middle line:84%
And my first response to that
was, "No, absolutely not."

00:36:49.408 --> 00:36:50.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Why?

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:51.243 align:middle line:90%
Why did you resist it?

00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:53.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I told
her, "I am surviving.

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:54.479 align:middle line:90%
I have a job.

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:57.949 align:middle line:84%
I am at college and this is the
best it's going to get for me.

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.151 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone."

00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:00.786 align:middle line:90%
And I was so terrified.

00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:04.589 align:middle line:84%
I was so terrified,
Lisa, of my body

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:07.192 align:middle line:84%
and of my emotions
and what was there.

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:09.161 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've eluded
to it a little bit,

00:37:09.161 --> 00:37:11.196 align:middle line:84%
but when you've experienced
trauma,

00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:13.699 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you
want is to be conscious

00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle line:90%
of the sensations in your body.

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:18.503 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that yoga
sounded like that.

00:37:18.503 --> 00:37:20.238 align:middle line:90%
But here's what got me.

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:23.275 align:middle line:84%
I'm three months
out, I hate my body,

00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:24.976 align:middle line:84%
and I am not healthy
at this point.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.945 align:middle line:90%
I'm probably 100 pounds.

00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:29.014 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's the best, you know,

00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's not a health
weight for me at all.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.787 align:middle line:84%
But I hated my body
and I missed exercising

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:38.523 align:middle line:84%
and my therapist said,
"You can't exercise;

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.591 align:middle line:90%
you've still got heart issues.

00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:40.158 align:middle line:90%
You can't run.

00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:40.859 align:middle line:90%
You can't bike.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:42.394 align:middle line:90%
But you can do yoga."

00:37:42.394 --> 00:37:43.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, so you had -

00:37:43.895 --> 00:37:47.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: And
so I was like, "Well,

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:49.968 align:middle line:90%
if it's a way to burn calories."

00:37:49.968 --> 00:37:51.036 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:37:51.036 --> 00:37:53.572 align:middle line:84%
It was slightly pathological
and it came

00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:56.408 align:middle line:84%
from I just wasn't
comfortable in my body.

00:37:56.408 --> 00:38:00.245 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, maybe yoga
will, you know, change my -

00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:03.281 align:middle line:84%
you know, make me more muscular
and that'll make me feel better

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.282 align:middle line:90%
because I just didn't -

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.718 align:middle line:84%
I had such a distorted
view of my body.

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:09.921 align:middle line:84%
So I went to yoga and I fell
in love with it immediately.

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:11.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: You did.

00:38:11.123 --> 00:38:13.058 align:middle line:84%
What was it about it that
you fell in love with?

00:38:13.058 --> 00:38:14.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well,
the first thing I fell

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:15.861 align:middle line:90%
in love with was the teacher.

00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:19.131 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean romantically
in love, but I had this teacher,

00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:21.266 align:middle line:90%
her name was Diana Roehl.

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:24.836 align:middle line:84%
She owned a studio there
called Diana's School of Yoga

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:27.239 align:middle line:84%
in Grand Prairie, Texas,
and she had this offer

00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:29.941 align:middle line:90%
that was ten classes for $10.00.

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Well, that's
something I can afford."

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:32.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah.

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:34.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: And I walked in

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:39.117 align:middle line:84%
and she is this big voluptuous
black woman and so warm

00:38:39.117 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and so open and so lively and
happy and I felt like, like,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.526 align:middle line:90%
you know, just so welcome there.

00:38:47.526 --> 00:38:50.195 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like people
dressed in Lululemon clothing.

00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:50.962 align:middle line:90%
They weren't perfect.

00:38:50.962 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:90%
They weren't athletic.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.033 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were real
people, everyone in the studio.

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:57.068 align:middle line:90%
And she made me feel so welcome.

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:00.205 align:middle line:84%
Now, for ten classes, she's
like, "So are you going

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:01.506 align:middle line:90%
to sign up for a membership?

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.308 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's - you know,
your practice is growing.

00:39:03.308 --> 00:39:04.109 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep you around."

00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:05.844 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Oh, no, no,

00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't afford that,
but it's been fun.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.916 align:middle line:84%
Thanks. You know, I'll
practice at home maybe."

00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:13.518 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "No, I think
we can work something out,"

00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:16.021 align:middle line:84%
and she allowed me to
clean the studio there

00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:17.255 align:middle line:90%
in exchange for yoga.

00:39:17.255 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Oh, my goodness.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.525 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful lady.

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: She's amazing.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: You had a lot

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:25.697 align:middle line:84%
of really wonderful
people help you.

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:26.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
was so lucky, but -

00:39:26.798 --> 00:39:27.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: And you took it.

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, I did.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.037 align:middle line:84%
And so part of it was that
I fell in love with yoga.

00:39:32.037 --> 00:39:34.773 align:middle line:84%
I feel in love with
the structure

00:39:34.773 --> 00:39:35.941 align:middle line:90%
of the Ashtanga practice.

00:39:35.941 --> 00:39:39.511 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was the
same thing every time.

00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:41.947 align:middle line:84%
Diana led it in this
beautiful way.

00:39:41.947 --> 00:39:43.715 align:middle line:90%
I loved the breathing.

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:46.051 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of fascinated
by my toes

00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:47.452 align:middle line:84%
and by these different
parts of my body

00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:48.553 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't really look at.

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but I would
say the real thing

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.124 align:middle line:90%
that hooked me was the fact

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that Diana brought
me into a community.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.764 align:middle line:84%
So she knew my name, she gave
me a role to play at the studio,

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.666 align:middle line:84%
she gave me a sense of
purpose in the community.

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:03.468 align:middle line:90%
I was contributing.

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:05.337 align:middle line:90%
I was cleaning the space.

00:40:05.337 --> 00:40:06.404 align:middle line:90%
I knew the space.

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.706 align:middle line:90%
I was part of home.

00:40:07.706 --> 00:40:10.208 align:middle line:84%
And she had these potlucks
that she would invite me to.

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:11.643 align:middle line:90%
She did these two-day retreats

00:40:11.643 --> 00:40:13.545 align:middle line:84%
that she would bring
me along for.

00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:16.882 align:middle line:84%
And so it was more than just
the practice itself that I fell

00:40:16.882 --> 00:40:20.118 align:middle line:84%
in love with and that really
hooked me; it was this sense

00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:22.587 align:middle line:84%
of belonging and
of tried [phonetic]

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:28.059 align:middle line:84%
and of having a purpose other
than starving and other than,

00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:30.262 align:middle line:84%
you know, being the
child of gay people.

00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:33.865 align:middle line:84%
I was a person valued in
her own right in that space

00:40:33.865 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and that meant a lot to me.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes.

00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:39.037 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're so well
spoken and you are so now

00:40:39.037 --> 00:40:41.072 align:middle line:90%
in touch with your feelings.

00:40:41.072 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:84%
What would you tell teens,
and what do you tell teens

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:48.413 align:middle line:84%
when you lecture, how to get
to the place you're at now?

00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:50.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well, it
depends on the population.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:53.385 align:middle line:84%
If I'm speaking to girls
who are in the throws

00:40:53.385 --> 00:40:55.287 align:middle line:84%
of an eating disorder,
so when I go and speak

00:40:55.287 --> 00:40:57.923 align:middle line:84%
at residential treatment
facilities,

00:40:57.923 --> 00:41:01.826 align:middle line:84%
the biggest message I want them
to know, and it's so simple,

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.162 align:middle line:84%
is just that there
is a way out of this.

00:41:04.162 --> 00:41:06.464 align:middle line:90%
It does get better.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:09.401 align:middle line:84%
I remember, especially in those
early days with my therapist,

00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:10.936 align:middle line:84%
you know, just being
out of the hospital,

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:13.605 align:middle line:84%
I remember telling her
- her name was Melody -

00:41:13.605 --> 00:41:16.575 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying, "Melody,
I look around and everyone

00:41:16.575 --> 00:41:18.109 align:middle line:84%
that I know that has struggled
with an eating disorder,

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:20.812 align:middle line:84%
and I know a lot of them,
they're 40, they're 50,

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:21.980 align:middle line:90%
they are still struggling.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.882 align:middle line:84%
They are still making
themselves throw up.

00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:24.749 align:middle line:90%
They're still dieting.

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:26.184 align:middle line:90%
They still hate their bodies.

00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:90%
There is no way out of this.

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.321 align:middle line:84%
I am going to struggle with
this the rest of my life.

00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:31.489 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hate myself
the rest of my life."

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.158 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel like
there was a way out.

00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:37.162 align:middle line:84%
And so the message I want young
girls who have eating disorders

00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:40.632 align:middle line:84%
and are struggling with this
to know there is a way out.

00:41:40.632 --> 00:41:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It really does get better.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.905 align:middle line:84%
I am happy, I am healthy, I
love my body, I love my life,

00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:49.641 align:middle line:84%
I don't think about food
or calories or exercise.

00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:52.544 align:middle line:84%
I just want them to
know that it's possible.

00:41:52.544 --> 00:41:53.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: I think even

00:41:53.778 --> 00:41:56.982 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have an
eating disorder label,

00:41:56.982 --> 00:41:59.818 align:middle line:84%
most people don't
like their bodies.

00:41:59.818 --> 00:42:01.052 align:middle line:90%
They are dieting.

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:03.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the $60
billion weight loss industry

00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have in America.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.293 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely an issue
for a lot of people

00:42:08.293 --> 00:42:10.195 align:middle line:90%
that we're not comfortable.

00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:13.064 align:middle line:84%
We look at areas of our body
and say we don't like that,

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:84%
we don't like this, we
look stupid in that.

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:18.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think you're
speaking for a lot of people.

00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:19.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: I know.

00:42:19.504 --> 00:42:22.307 align:middle line:84%
It's - and it comes down to
I don't think it's so much

00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
about hating our bodies as
it is about hating ourselves.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.981 align:middle line:84%
So we either don't know how
to deal with our emotions or,

00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:34.486 align:middle line:84%
at the base, you know,
at the base we feel -

00:42:34.486 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:90%
we have a self-loathing.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.224 align:middle line:84%
And that comes out in our body
because it's easier to say

00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:43.561 align:middle line:84%
"I hate my chin" or "I hate
my ears" or "I hate my nose"

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:47.132 align:middle line:84%
than it is to say
"I hate my life."

00:42:47.132 --> 00:42:48.867 align:middle line:90%
You know? I mean, it's just -

00:42:48.867 --> 00:42:53.938 align:middle line:84%
it's a way of making
concrete a feeling

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that is sometimes just a sense

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.643 align:middle line:84%
of existential crises
in the world.

00:42:58.643 --> 00:43:00.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So what
do you suggest instead?

00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:03.415 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you get out of
that general overall loathing

00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:07.252 align:middle line:84%
of the body, even if you have or
don't have an eating disorder?

00:43:07.252 --> 00:43:11.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I think it
starts with, and this is kind

00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:14.225 align:middle line:84%
of where the role of therapy
comes in and just, you know,

00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:18.163 align:middle line:84%
any type of self-exploration
is understanding

00:43:18.163 --> 00:43:19.964 align:middle line:90%
where those beliefs come from.

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:24.969 align:middle line:84%
So where did I learn that
I was not okay as I am?

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:30.008 align:middle line:84%
Where did I learn that being
- needing someone is not okay?

00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:32.577 align:middle line:84%
That's been one of the biggest
things was where did I learn

00:43:32.577 --> 00:43:34.979 align:middle line:84%
that needing another
person was not okay.

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.981 align:middle line:84%
Because that's why
I rejected food is

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:41.853 align:middle line:84%
because I thought my own need
was going to annihilate everyone

00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:43.221 align:middle line:90%
and everything around me.

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.791 align:middle line:84%
So understanding where
that came from helps a lot.

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.893 align:middle line:84%
Once you can recognize
where it comes from,

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:51.896 align:middle line:84%
the origins of that belief, I
think then you have the power

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:53.531 align:middle line:90%
to start changing that belief.

00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:56.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So the opposite
of that would be it's okay

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:58.269 align:middle line:90%
to need somebody else.

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:00.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: It's
okay to need someone else.

00:44:00.205 --> 00:44:04.209 align:middle line:90%
It's okay to want someone else.

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's okay to want a hug.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.278 align:middle line:90%
It's okay to need love.

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It's okay to need support.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.216 align:middle line:84%
That's - when I go to
universities and I speak

00:44:11.216 --> 00:44:13.685 align:middle line:84%
to general audiences who
are dealing with addiction,

00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:16.254 align:middle line:84%
who are dealing with the loss
of a loved one, who are dealing

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:84%
with eating disorders, whatever
it is, whatever that sense

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:23.428 align:middle line:84%
of suffering is coming from,
you've got to ask for support.

00:44:23.428 --> 00:44:26.898 align:middle line:84%
You have to open to being
supported by friend,

00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:90%
by family, by a community.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.569 align:middle line:90%
Because you cant do this alone.

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:33.905 align:middle line:84%
And I think often -
I actually wrote -

00:44:33.905 --> 00:44:35.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
very important.

00:44:35.874 --> 00:44:37.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I wrote
a chapter in a book called

00:44:37.776 --> 00:44:40.979 align:middle line:84%
"21st Century Yoga" about
healing from an eating disorder

00:44:40.979 --> 00:44:45.116 align:middle line:84%
and I do remember this one
section that just sort of poured

00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:49.287 align:middle line:84%
out of me and I said, "Healing
doesn't happen in a vacuum."

00:44:49.287 --> 00:44:50.522 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't.

00:44:50.522 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:90%
We need others.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.192 align:middle line:84%
We need to be reflected
in the eyes of others.

00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:56.227 align:middle line:84%
We need our beauty
to shine back.

00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what
those doctors did

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.365 align:middle line:84%
for me is they looked at
me every day and they said,

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
"I don't care if you
don't want to live.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.901 align:middle line:90%
I want you to live.

00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:04.569 align:middle line:90%
I think you're smart.

00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:05.703 align:middle line:90%
I think you're beautiful.

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:07.105 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a lot
to give to the world."

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:09.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And you eventually
just started to believe them.

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:13.745 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need other
people is sometimes we look

00:45:13.745 --> 00:45:17.348 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror and we don't see
our beauty because it's been

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:20.318 align:middle line:84%
so clouded by all these messages
that we've gotten from the media

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:23.488 align:middle line:84%
or from our family or from
our difficult experiences.

00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:27.025 align:middle line:84%
We need other people to
remind us of our humanity.

00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:28.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:29.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm glad that
you're writing a book.

00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that you're out
there in communities lecturing

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.299 align:middle line:84%
because you're really giving
this message to people.

00:45:34.299 --> 00:45:38.803 align:middle line:84%
And then through yoga you found
a whole new inner strength it

00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:40.638 align:middle line:84%
looks like because
now you teach it.

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:43.641 align:middle line:90%
You went on to become a teacher.

00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:45.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I
love this practice.

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:47.278 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
self-exploration,

00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:51.749 align:middle line:84%
I think yoga has beneath
it a philosophical model

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.619 align:middle line:84%
and also a community
that's interested in growth

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:57.655 align:middle line:84%
and self-growth and so
I completely immersed

00:45:57.655 --> 00:46:00.625 align:middle line:84%
in the community and now I teach
a workshop called "Fall Back

00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:04.262 align:middle line:84%
in Love With Your Body" that
helps anyone, men, women,

00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:07.265 align:middle line:84%
children, you know,
75-year-olds,

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:08.900 align:middle line:90%
who are struggling with that.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are overweight
and some of them are underweight

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and some of them are, you
know, at a perfect BMI.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.011 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, we, through
the practice of yoga,

00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:23.615 align:middle line:84%
learn to connect with the
sematic experience of our body

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:28.086 align:middle line:84%
and to experience the
pleasure and the life

00:46:28.086 --> 00:46:32.023 align:middle line:84%
that our body connects us to
and then, you know, examine some

00:46:32.023 --> 00:46:35.860 align:middle line:84%
of those beliefs that shroud
that light and shroud that life.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, let's take
a look at Chelsea in her -

00:46:38.496 --> 00:46:43.334 align:middle line:84%
teaching a workshop, actually,
on not having fear of -

00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:44.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Yeah, releasing fear.

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yeah, of yoga.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.538 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:56.614 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:46:58.082 --> 00:46:59.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: [Background
music] I'm teaching a workshop

00:46:59.284 --> 00:47:01.886 align:middle line:84%
called "Flying Arm
Balances Without Fear"

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what
the workshop is all

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.259 align:middle line:84%
about is just going
straight into your practice

00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:11.162 align:middle line:84%
without any fear and trying
new things without fear.

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:16.267 align:middle line:84%
I think arm balances are
sometimes these postures

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:84%
that are really intimidating
and we walk in

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:29.714 align:middle line:84%
and we see somebody's
feet flying off the ground

00:47:29.714 --> 00:47:33.151 align:middle line:84%
and we're like, "I'm
never going to do that.

00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:39.724 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even want to try it
because I don't want to fail."

00:47:39.724 --> 00:47:45.263 align:middle line:84%
This is about stepping onto
your mat and trying something

00:47:45.263 --> 00:47:51.269 align:middle line:84%
and being willing to fail
and being willing to fall

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:56.941 align:middle line:84%
and really even, you know, like,
crushing what that's all about

00:47:56.941 --> 00:48:02.447 align:middle line:84%
and bringing a sense of
playfulness into your practice.

00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So not only do you
teach yoga, but you also lecture

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:11.189 align:middle line:84%
across the country to caregivers
about how to handle people

00:48:11.189 --> 00:48:14.625 align:middle line:84%
who are in your -
were in your situation

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:17.028 align:middle line:90%
or are in your situation.

00:48:17.028 --> 00:48:19.864 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
explain to them?

00:48:19.864 --> 00:48:22.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
Well, when I was 20,

00:48:22.367 --> 00:48:25.903 align:middle line:84%
so this is like a few
years after I'd been

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:28.973 align:middle line:84%
out of the hospital,
my mom was diagnosed

00:48:28.973 --> 00:48:32.744 align:middle line:84%
with a disorder called
Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.

00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I actually got a panicked
call from my sister.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.249 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't living at home.

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:41.052 align:middle line:84%
She found blood all
over the house.

00:48:41.052 --> 00:48:43.955 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know where
my mom was.

00:48:43.955 --> 00:48:46.457 align:middle line:84%
I drove down there,
found my mom in a jail,

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:49.227 align:middle line:84%
and my mom had no
idea who I was.

00:48:49.227 --> 00:48:51.562 align:middle line:84%
So she was in jail
for three months.

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:55.033 align:middle line:84%
Over that time, it came out that
she had this disorder called

00:48:55.033 --> 00:48:57.969 align:middle line:84%
Wernicke-Korsakoff
Syndrome, which is a form

00:48:57.969 --> 00:49:00.938 align:middle line:90%
of alcohol-induced dementia.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:05.476 align:middle line:84%
So when you drink a
lot and you don't eat,

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:09.514 align:middle line:84%
so she was not eating, you
develop a thiamine deficiency,

00:49:09.514 --> 00:49:11.949 align:middle line:84%
which depletes Wernicke's
area in the brain,

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.118 align:middle line:84%
which is responsible
for short-term memory.

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:16.521 align:middle line:84%
So simply, in simple terms,
this looks like Alzheimer's.

00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:17.889 align:middle line:90%
She came out of the hospital.

00:49:17.889 --> 00:49:21.526 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, she has a sister
- four brothers and sisters

00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:23.561 align:middle line:84%
and one sister stepped
up, thank God.

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:27.065 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't connected
with my mom's family at all.

00:49:27.065 --> 00:49:29.667 align:middle line:84%
We weren't - we were never -
we didn't go to family reunions

00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:31.069 align:middle line:90%
or anything when I was a kid.

00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But she came out and helped me
get my mom into a care facility

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.508 align:middle line:90%
in Austin, where she was.

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:40.378 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Dallas
at the time.

00:49:40.378 --> 00:49:42.713 align:middle line:84%
And she's been there
for three years now.

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:44.015 align:middle line:84%
She functions at about the
level of a ten-year-old.

00:49:44.015 --> 00:49:45.416 align:middle line:84%
She now recognizes me and
she recognizes my sister,

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:46.651 align:middle line:84%
so that source of long-term
memory has come back,

00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:47.952 align:middle line:84%
but she'll call me
ten times a day

00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:49.053 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't remember
she called the first time.

00:49:49.053 --> 00:49:50.455 align:middle line:84%
And she leaves the same
message every time.

00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:51.722 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as hard as that
sounds, when I go and I speak

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.657 align:middle line:84%
about caregiving, because
that's really - you know,

00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:53.858 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of come
into this place

00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:54.959 align:middle line:84%
of being her primary
caregiver and, in some ways,

00:49:54.959 --> 00:49:56.094 align:middle line:84%
being her parent, I
talk about - you know,

00:49:56.094 --> 00:49:57.295 align:middle line:84%
I talk about 1) just the
host of issues that come

00:49:57.295 --> 00:49:58.229 align:middle line:84%
from grieving the loss
of someone with dementia.

00:49:58.229 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't come back.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:00.932 align:middle line:84%
They're never going to be the
same person you knew them as.

00:50:00.932 --> 00:50:02.066 align:middle line:84%
And they really - I mean,
those first couple of years,

00:50:02.066 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying it's
like talking to a ghost.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.001 align:middle line:90%
It's her body, but it's not her.

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:04.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's very
confusing, I'm sure.

00:50:04.936 --> 00:50:05.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
It's so confusing.

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:07.271 align:middle line:84%
And especially when
you're young.

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:08.272 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some people out
there who lose their parents

00:50:08.272 --> 00:50:09.607 align:middle line:84%
at an early age to
a similar illness

00:50:09.607 --> 00:50:10.708 align:middle line:84%
or they lose their parents
altogether and that's something

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:11.542 align:middle line:84%
that we all have to
confront at some point.

00:50:11.542 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Right, but you had

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.146 align:middle line:84%
to become your own parent
at a very early age.

00:50:15.146 --> 00:50:18.716 align:middle line:84%
And now, still, you're
now in the parent role.

00:50:18.716 --> 00:50:20.384 align:middle line:84%
So you're not only
parenting yourself,

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.953 align:middle line:84%
but you're also parenting
your mother.

00:50:21.953 --> 00:50:24.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah, so
there's a couple of kind

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:27.725 align:middle line:84%
of big lessons I've
learned from that.

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:33.898 align:middle line:84%
One is that I'm not responsible
for her illness and I think

00:50:33.898 --> 00:50:37.668 align:middle line:84%
for all - for every
caregiver I know,

00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:39.237 align:middle line:90%
whether they be 80 years old

00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:41.772 align:middle line:84%
and have a spouse that's
developed Alzheimer's

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:44.375 align:middle line:84%
or they be 40 years old
and are just struggling

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:46.944 align:middle line:90%
with losing a mom or dad,

00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:49.046 align:middle line:84%
there's this sense
of survivor's guilt.

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:52.917 align:middle line:84%
There's this sense of just why
can't I do better for them.

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:55.153 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I get them
into a better place?

00:50:55.153 --> 00:50:56.921 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I bring
them happiness?

00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:58.623 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a bad daughter.

00:50:58.623 --> 00:51:00.057 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a bad spouse.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.025 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a bad husband.

00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a bad mother.

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:05.429 align:middle line:84%
So there's this sense
of responsibility and,

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:08.132 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can tell,
I think that comes

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:11.202 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know how
to sit with just grief.

00:51:11.202 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And so we want to control it.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.507 align:middle line:84%
And so guilt gives us this
sense of control over it.

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:18.809 align:middle line:84%
Like, "Well, if I feel guilty
about it, I'm responsible

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.378 align:middle line:90%
for it and I can fix it."

00:51:20.378 --> 00:51:23.447 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just accepting
the fact that my mother

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:26.184 align:middle line:84%
as I knew her is gone,
I felt guilty about it

00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:28.853 align:middle line:84%
because that made me feel a
little more in control of it,

00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:31.956 align:middle line:84%
like I might be able to fix
it if I feel guilty enough.

00:51:31.956 --> 00:51:34.892 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of the messages
I give to caregivers is just

00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:41.999 align:middle line:84%
that it's not your fault and
the real process of healing

00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:44.936 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with this comes from
sitting with grief and comes

00:51:44.936 --> 00:51:49.106 align:middle line:84%
from just acknowledging the
sadness and mourning the loss

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:50.208 align:middle line:90%
of the person you loved.

00:51:50.208 --> 00:51:52.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And also
support groups are -

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:54.712 align:middle line:84%
you're not the only
one going through this.

00:51:54.712 --> 00:51:56.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: And
I'm in this process now.

00:51:56.681 --> 00:52:00.785 align:middle line:84%
It's only three years in and so
I'm learning myself that I need

00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:02.486 align:middle line:84%
to have a support
group around me.

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:05.423 align:middle line:84%
I need to have not just
my friends and family,

00:52:05.423 --> 00:52:07.558 align:middle line:90%
but people who know this world.

00:52:07.558 --> 00:52:10.094 align:middle line:84%
So I work with a group called
the Los Angeles Caregiver

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:12.663 align:middle line:84%
Resource Center and they have
support groups once a month.

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:16.767 align:middle line:84%
And I go and most of the people
at the support group are 50,

00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:20.271 align:middle line:84%
but I'm surrounded by people
who are in the struggle

00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:23.608 align:middle line:84%
and who can hold that
sense of pain with me

00:52:23.608 --> 00:52:24.742 align:middle line:90%
and can also share the joy.

00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:27.712 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's so much
joy in caregiving, too.

00:52:27.712 --> 00:52:30.181 align:middle line:90%
My mom is, in some ways, happier

00:52:30.181 --> 00:52:32.383 align:middle line:84%
than I've ever seen
her in my life.

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:33.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: She's not complex.

00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:35.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: She's not -

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:37.822 align:middle line:84%
whatever was making her drink
is not in her awareness anymore

00:52:37.822 --> 00:52:40.825 align:middle line:84%
and she giggles and
laughs like - you know,

00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:42.627 align:middle line:84%
like I'm sure she
did as a child.

00:52:42.627 --> 00:52:44.328 align:middle line:90%
And I never got to see that.

00:52:44.328 --> 00:52:46.998 align:middle line:84%
And being in a support group,
I get to share that joy

00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:49.767 align:middle line:84%
with others and sometimes
they need to remind me

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:51.435 align:middle line:90%
of that when things are hard.

00:52:51.435 --> 00:52:53.871 align:middle line:84%
That's why, once again,
I think you've got to be

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.373 align:middle line:90%
with community, you know.

00:52:55.373 --> 00:52:57.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Yes, absolutely.

00:52:57.642 --> 00:52:59.543 align:middle line:84%
In all of the levels
that you speak about,

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:84%
you talked about eating
disorders and to teens,

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you talked to the caregivers of
the people in those facilities,

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.186 align:middle line:84%
and you now have another
perspective yet of speaking

00:53:09.186 --> 00:53:14.225 align:middle line:84%
to one who is caring for their
parent, all at a very young age.

00:53:14.225 --> 00:53:16.294 align:middle line:84%
You just had your 25th
birthday, is that -

00:53:16.294 --> 00:53:17.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Oh, no, 23.

00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:18.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Twenty-third,
23rd.

00:53:18.963 --> 00:53:20.965 align:middle line:90%
I cant - 23.

00:53:20.965 --> 00:53:22.199 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
You keep aging me.

00:53:23.668 --> 00:53:27.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: You better
come back when you're 25.

00:53:27.338 --> 00:53:28.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Deal.

00:53:28.406 --> 00:53:29.774 align:middle line:84%
I will have a book
in hand by that time.

00:53:29.774 --> 00:53:31.542 align:middle line:90%
We will set that commitment now.

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:33.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: I think you're
going to have several, Chelsea.

00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a movie about your life.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have - and the
wonderful thing that I love is

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:42.286 align:middle line:84%
that you are so well
spoken about your emotions

00:53:42.286 --> 00:53:46.557 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to look at
an overarching theme in all

00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:48.893 align:middle line:84%
of this, what would
you say that it is?

00:53:48.893 --> 00:53:52.296 align:middle line:84%
What's the one thing that you
live your life by every day?

00:53:52.296 --> 00:53:55.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Love is found
in the arms of other people.

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Wow.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I think
that's where it is.

00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:01.972 align:middle line:84%
I think we all seek love
and we all need love deeply

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and we do find self-love
and we do need self-love,

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:08.512 align:middle line:90%
but I think we need people.

00:54:08.512 --> 00:54:12.883 align:middle line:84%
And I think that love and joy
comes in connecting with people

00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:16.020 align:middle line:84%
in an authentic and a
real and a genuine way.

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And being able
to actually receive that love.

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:19.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff:
That's sometimes

00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:21.692 align:middle line:84%
where the self-love
comes in because you have

00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:24.895 align:middle line:84%
to love yourself enough
to be open to that.

00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:26.097 align:middle line:90%
To be open to a hug.

00:54:26.097 --> 00:54:28.532 align:middle line:84%
Like, my friends tell me
that I give the best hugs

00:54:28.532 --> 00:54:30.634 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably because
I really need them.

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:32.370 align:middle line:90%
So when I hug, I really hug.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.306 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I - I've got
a friend who calls me The Cub

00:54:35.306 --> 00:54:38.409 align:middle line:84%
because I hug like a
cub and it's probably

00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:40.811 align:middle line:84%
because when I hug, I
want that connection.

00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:42.613 align:middle line:90%
And we need that connection.

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:47.218 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
overarching message is

00:54:47.218 --> 00:54:49.553 align:middle line:84%
that we need love
and we find that love

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:52.456 align:middle line:90%
in others and with others.

00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:53.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: With others.

00:54:53.591 --> 00:54:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And as well - but it's
important that you said

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.561 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just
counting the self-love.

00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: No,
you need that as well,

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:05.169 align:middle line:84%
but I do think that, for me, the
story of healing and that sort

00:55:05.169 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of magic dose was in loving
myself enough to being open

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.609 align:middle line:90%
to being loved by others.

00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:13.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And so now
you're teaching at Omega

00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and various places
around the country.

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah,
I've got a work -

00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:18.282 align:middle line:90%
I've got a retreat coming

00:55:18.282 --> 00:55:21.552 align:middle line:84%
up at the Omega Institute
June 21st through 23rd.

00:55:21.552 --> 00:55:25.756 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching a program on
the Keys to Resilience,

00:55:25.756 --> 00:55:28.058 align:middle line:84%
which is what my upcoming
book will be about.

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.494 align:middle line:84%
It's a memoir/book
about resilience,

00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:33.864 align:middle line:84%
but that's at the Feathered
Pipe Institute in Montana,

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:84%
and that's the last
week of August.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: That's
an important thing

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.602 align:middle line:84%
that you just said
is about resilience.

00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:41.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yeah,
I'm fascinated by it.

00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:42.206 align:middle line:90%
I -

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:43.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Well, you've
done it all your life.

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:45.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: Well, but what
- you know, the big question

00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:48.846 align:middle line:84%
for me is why do some people
thrive in the face of adversity

00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:52.716 align:middle line:84%
and why do some people turn to
addiction and turn to, you know,

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.185 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy coping mechanisms?

00:55:54.185 --> 00:55:55.753 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
a time in my life

00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:57.087 align:middle line:90%
in which I wasn't resilient.

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.956 align:middle line:90%
I didn't thrive.

00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:00.224 align:middle line:90%
And then eventually -

00:56:00.224 --> 00:56:01.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: What is the
difference, do you think?

00:56:01.659 --> 00:56:02.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Roff: I'm
trying to figure that out.

00:56:02.793 --> 00:56:05.496 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm writing the book.

00:56:05.496 --> 00:56:08.032 align:middle line:90%
For - and I'll let you know.

00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:10.201 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of trying to
unlock the variables.

00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:12.636 align:middle line:84%
I think it's multifaceted
and I don't know

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:15.172 align:middle line:84%
that it can be answered
in a single variable,

00:56:15.172 --> 00:56:19.844 align:middle line:84%
but I think part of it is
having the structure and support

00:56:19.844 --> 00:56:24.114 align:middle line:84%
around you to be able to mine
the gems in the adversity.

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:27.451 align:middle line:84%
So finding - okay,
so this - you know,

00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:31.755 align:middle line:84%
losing my mom was just
agonizing, but it taught me

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.959 align:middle line:84%
to forgive and it taught
me that I was stronger

00:56:34.959 --> 00:56:37.027 align:middle line:90%
than I believed myself to be.

00:56:37.027 --> 00:56:41.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: So maybe it's
that you can go from crumbling

00:56:41.031 --> 00:56:44.235 align:middle line:84%
in the face of adversity
to becoming resilient

00:56:44.235 --> 00:56:45.836 align:middle line:90%
in the face of adversity.

00:56:45.836 --> 00:56:48.205 align:middle line:84%
It's not one or the
other, but it's both.

00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:49.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Yes.

00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:50.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Maybe that's it.

00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:51.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Absolutely.

00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:52.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Alright,
well, thank you so much.

00:56:52.076 --> 00:56:53.577 align:middle line:90%
You're such an inspiration.

00:56:53.577 --> 00:56:56.614 align:middle line:84%
You have spoken the words and
the feelings and the emotions

00:56:56.614 --> 00:56:59.149 align:middle line:84%
and the thoughts that many
people have never been able

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:00.718 align:middle line:90%
to put words to.

00:57:00.718 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So you represented a
lot of people today.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.955 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:05.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Thank you.

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me, Lisa.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: And
for being so open

00:57:07.992 --> 00:57:09.827 align:middle line:84%
and you're a pleasure
to talk to.

00:57:09.827 --> 00:57:12.062 align:middle line:84%
So thanks, good luck with
everything you're doing,

00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:13.764 align:middle line:84%
and let us know when your
book comes out, okay?

00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:14.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Chelsea Roff: Okay.

00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:15.466 align:middle line:90%
