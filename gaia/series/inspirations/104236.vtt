00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are broadcasting
here from Denver, Colorado.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to find out
how our ancestors lived

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:90%
50,000 years ago?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Before there were processed
foods and Type 2 diabetes,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
what exactly accounted
for their well-being?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today is researcher
and medical anthropologist Dr.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Alberto Villoldo to talk
about "One Spirit Medicine."

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Based on an extreme
health crisis,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Villoldo discovered that
these ancient shamanic healing

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
methods that go back to
our paleolithic ancestors

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
50,000 years ago are
what helped him heal.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. ALBERTO VILLOLDO:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.004 align:middle line:90%
Great to be with you.

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You too.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
You have an enormous
amount of information

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.612 align:middle line:84%
that I want to cover
in this next hour.

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But I first want to start
off with your journey

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and your story.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
What was the health crisis
that you experienced?

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: I'm a
medical anthropologist

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:84%
by training, which
means that I spend time

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles in the Amazon, in
Mexico, in Asia, in Indonesia,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and the savannas in Africa.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere I
went, I picked up

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
some traveler, unknown
traveler, a bug or a parasite

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:90%
that accompanied me.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And then 40 years later, a few
years ago, three years ago,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:90%
my health collapsed.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't walk
more than 100 feet

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
without being totally
out of breath.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went in for a
head-to-toe medical check-up.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors put
me on a world map.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had four different
kinds of parasites,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
three different kinds to
worm, five different kinds

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of hepatitis.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And they
said, you should be dead.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Now, I've never had
a diagnosis like that before.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.891 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And it
wasn't that encouraging.

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They told me I should
go in for a liver

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
transplant, that my heart
was riddled with worms,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.665 align:middle line:90%
and I had parasites in my brain.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, you know
how hard it is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.562 align:middle line:90%
to find a good brain these days.

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so it's not like
you just had the liver to deal

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
with, the heart and the brain,
and each one of those are

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.129 align:middle line:90%
major--

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.295 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely major

00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --repair system.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, I was going
to go on a liver transplant list

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.012 align:middle line:84%
and possibly a
heart list as well.

00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So I decided
instead to grow a new body.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.057 align:middle line:84%
And we know how to
grow a new body.

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You would have to.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO:
Literally, I made it.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So, we know how to grow a
body because we did once.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
We grew a body once.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We grew hearts and livers and
organs and 10 fingers, 10 toes.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, in utero, though.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but we know how to do it.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
these instructions in our DNA

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
are now in
password-protected regions.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want
to be growing new fingers

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
throughout your life.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to do, which
is what the shamans have all

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
learned to do, which
is how to break

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
into those password-protected
regions in our DNA

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
to grow new organs.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the energy medicine

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the ancients is
about, is how do we

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
grow a new body that ages and
heals and dies differently?

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And today I have a brand
new liver, brand new heart,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.826 align:middle line:84%
and my old brain back, better
than it's ever been before.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But they were
not transplanted.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
These are your original organs.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.549 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: These
are new organs.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain the difference.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, every
cell in your body's

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
replaced every
eight to 10 months.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no one in
the planet that's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:90%
more than seven years old.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So the option that
you have is to grow.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Every seven years you're going
to grow a new body anyway.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
You can grow one that's a little
bit older, a little bit more

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.956 align:middle line:84%
wrinkled than the last one, or
you can grow a brand new one.

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does this
just have to do

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.472 align:middle line:84%
with a mindset, or
chemical physical changes?

00:03:57.472 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: It's biochemical.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the biochemical,
with the food that you eat.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we don't
heal as well as we used to,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:84%
because of foods we're
eating today are toxic.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:90%
They're poisoning us.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have access
to these regions in our DNA

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.791 align:middle line:84%
that can trigger the growth
of new healthy tissue.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.229 align:middle line:84%
So if we continue to eat
the way that we're eating--

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: We're going to die.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It's going to kill us.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is the difference
between the paleolithic diet

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors and our diet
today, which is mostly grains,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:90%
which are carbohydrates.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.415 align:middle line:84%
They're turning to sugars
that are killing us.

00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, these
grains, though,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
are different grains than we
had maybe 50,000 years ago.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain?

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, 50 years ago,
but explain what our ancestors

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:90%
ate 50,000 years ago.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, our
paleolithic ancestors

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
were primarily
hunters and gatherers,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:90%
so they ate fats and proteins.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:90%
That was the primary diet.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have a minimum
daily requirement of fats

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and of proteins.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But carbohydrates, the
minimum daily requirement

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of carbohydrate, do
you know what it is?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Not for brain function?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We do not need any
carbs in our diet.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So carbs are introduced--
well, we did of course

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.612 align:middle line:90%
eat carbs 10,000 years ago.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Through
vegetables though, right?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.778 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Through
the vegetables.

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But then around 6,000
years ago, at the end

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of the last glacial period, you
have the dawn of agriculture.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And with agriculture coming
we begin to eat cabs,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and we begin to eat grains.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.577 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe the grain, the
preferred grain was the wheat,

00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and they're people of the wheat.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
In America were
people of the corn.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
In Asia, they're
people of the rice.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you
have the rise of religion

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and the rise of warfare.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And you find this embedded
in religion, the relationship

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
to the grains.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Lord's Prayer that we

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
learned when we were children
says, and give us this day

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
our daily fats and
proteins, right?

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Give us this
day our daily bread.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.376 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Our daily bread.

00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So then religions are tied
to grains and to agriculture

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and to warfare.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So many wars are
waged in the name

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.647 align:middle line:84%
of whose god is the real god
or the more powerful god.

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does that
have to do with rice?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
because the carbs,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
the grains turn into
sugars, and they

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
feed a part of the brain that is
very ancient, that is violent,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:90%
angry, and predatory.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.068 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:84%

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The fats do, particularly the

And they feed the
higher brain, which

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
is the brain that is able to
see our interconnectedness

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%

an interesting topic.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So, eating carbs could cause you

angry temper?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: The brain that feeds
on carbs is the limbic brain,

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%

fundamental programs, which

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%

It thrives on being
self righteous.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It has very poor self esteem.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It lives in scarcity, and it's
not able to live in intimacy.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's the brain of fear, the
brain of fear and of violence.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.034 align:middle line:84%
And it feeds on
sugars, on carbs.

00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've
described what most

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.908 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, these programs are encoded
in the form of emotions,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
because emotions are
a very, very good way

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
to remember things.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So what the shamans say, the
old medicine people, they say,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
you cannot ever
heal you emotions.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
You have to get rid
of your emotions.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.489 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are residues
of ancient survival programs

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:90%
that are dated.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.575 align:middle line:84%
And you have to replace
them with feelings.

00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember
reading this in your book.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So
feelings are authentic.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are ancient
survival programs.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And the way to know the
difference between them

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
is that, see, the brain resets
itself every 20 minutes,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:90%
the brain and nervous system.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And if anything lasts
longer than 20 minutes,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:90%
it's not a feeling.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotion.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.117 align:middle line:84%
Feelings of love, of caring,
but they wash through you.

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:90%

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:90%

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You have that great, delicious

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
to your therapist

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not going

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.721 align:middle line:84%
you have to shift the

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Which
is the blueprint.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
important, but I

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to the
grams for a second.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter
of people being

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
allergic to the genetically
modified organism in the grain.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of it
feeding, as a grain,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
or not, feeding

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
the limbic system of the brain,
thus causing the emotions

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.305 align:middle line:90%
to take over the body.

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: That's
one of the problems.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The other is that most of
us, 98% of the population

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:90%
is gluten sensitive.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you're gluten sensitive,
you end up with a leaky gut,

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have particles
of gluten and food

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
going into the bloodstream.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system mounts
a huge response against it,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
because it says, hey, this
food particle, that's foreign.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.126 align:middle line:90%
And then you have inflammation.

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the leaky gut
part-- and we have so much

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to talk about-- but the leaky
gut, the glue, the gluten

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
basically sticks to
the side of the walls.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.316 align:middle line:84%
I learned this from
watching one of the videos

00:11:10.316 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to watch
in a second of yours.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
cause a leaky gut?

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.489 align:middle line:90%
Explain that barrier.

00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, the way
the leaky gut is caused

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:90%
is by a protein called zonulin.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And zonulin is these
unrecognized by the body.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a new protein that's only
developed since agriculture.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And our DNA doesn't
recognize it,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
so it tends to wedge itself in
the tight junctions in the gut.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember, what the
job of the gut is

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is to take what is not
you, which is food,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and turn it into you.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is energy.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is done by the
microbes in your gut.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But zonulin wedges itself
between the tight junction

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and creates openings, and you're
able to have food particles

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and microbes from your own flora
are going into the bloodstream,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a huge
immune response, which

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
results in inflammation
and results

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
in your brain getting
inflamed, on fire.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.787 align:middle line:84%

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
we need to step beyond the
Western paradigm of disease.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
shamanic traditions,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
there was only one ailment,
which was our disconnection

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
from spirit, and
only one treatment,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:90%
which was one spirit medicine.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
One spirit medicine is
founded on three principles.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that we
have to repair our brain.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
When we repair our brain, we're
able to heal our emotions.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We cannot heal our emotions
by talking about them.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.225 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only way
to heal our emotions

00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
is to get rid of our
emotions, because emotions

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
are ancient survival
programs programmed

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.812 align:middle line:84%
into a predatory and
primitive region in the brain.

00:14:33.812 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
A brain that lives on
scarcity, a brain that

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
lives on fear, a
brain that projects

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.072 align:middle line:90%
its own turmoil onto others.

00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Through one spirit
medicine, you'll

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
learn how you can get rid
of all of your emotions

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and replace them with feelings.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.029 align:middle line:90%
Feelings are authentic.

00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:53.695 align:middle line:90%
They don't last.

00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Emotions linger.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Emotions keep us angry
with someone for 20 minutes

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.785 align:middle line:90%
or 20 days or 20 years.

00:15:02.785 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When we repair the brain, we
heal ourselves of our emotions.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And this book will tell you how
you can do that in six weeks.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
The second step is that we
need to repair our guts.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:90%
The human body is a colony.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
90% of our DNA belongs to
microbes that are not even us,

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
600 different varieties of
microbes that inhabit our gut

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and our skin and our mouth.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And our microbe colonies
are out of balance.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, so much so
that we can no longer

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
trust our gut instinct anymore,
because our gut has gone bad.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
In one spirit
medicine, we teach you

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
how you can repair your
gut through probiotics,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
through specialty
probiotics that

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:90%
bring balance to the colony.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when your gut is
out, your instinct is gone.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
You start gravitating
towards the wrong people,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the wrong relationships,
and the wrong decisions

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and miss the great
opportunities in life.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
When we re-establish
our gut, what happens

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:90%
is that our allergies disappear.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Our brain fog clears.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:90%
We're able to sleep and to rest.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And then our body's able to
establish balance once again.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The third cornerstone
of one spirit medicine

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is that we must experience
states of communion

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
with all of life, what
has been described

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient literature
as states of enlightenment

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and that are available to
us once we repair our brain.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
In these states of communion,
we understand the oneness

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, and we
are able to download

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
from the great hard
drive of the universe

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
the techniques for dreaming
a new world into being,

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
for dreaming our
health into being,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
for dreaming our
relationships into being,

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
for working actively
with our abilities

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
to create the world with
beauty and with health

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and with generosity and
to create really the world

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.729 align:middle line:84%
that we want our children's
children to inherit.

00:17:16.729 --> 00:17:23.851 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so
that covered three ways

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
to heal the brain.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But first I want to go back
to the conversation about fats

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and proteins.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Because we did talk about the
carbs and the limbic system.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
The fats and the proteins,
and what about vegetables?

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And what part of the
brain do they feed?

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO:
Vegetables, are carbs,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:90%
but they're complex carbs.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't turn into
sugars very readily.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.348 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What category do
they fall into though?

00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: They fall
into the carbs category.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But remember that we
co-evolved with the plants,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
not with the animals.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The vegetables are nutrient
dense and calorie poor.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the key to
your health, nutrient dense

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.884 align:middle line:90%
and calorie, sugar poor foods.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is all the veggies.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But they contain
the instructions

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
for switching on the
genes that create health

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and switching off the
genes that create disease.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.884 align:middle line:84%
When you eat your
veggies or you drink

00:18:15.884 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
green juice in the
morning, you're

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
switching on more than 500
genes that create health.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And this is the
principle of energy medicine,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.809 align:middle line:84%
is you create the conditions for
health and disease goes away.

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Side note--

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.099 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You
don't treat disease.

00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it
matter if it's juiced,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
or does it have to
be cold pressed?

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Just a real quick
side note there.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Ideally it's juiced.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.677 align:middle line:84%
Ideally it's juiced, and
you don't want the fiber.

00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You can eat your
fiber somewhere else.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.936 align:middle line:90%
You want the instructions.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:90%
These are genetic switches.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:90%
This is epigenetics.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're instructing
your genes to switch

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
on the conditions
that produce health

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.279 align:middle line:84%
and switch off the genes
that produce pathology.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you said you
don't treat the disease.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:90%
You treat the--

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, this is
the basis of shamanic healing

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is that you create the physical,
the dietary, the energetic,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
conditions for health.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
And disease goes away.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Create the conditions for
health, disease goes away.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:90%
So you don't treat disease.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the obsession
that we have in the West.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.889 align:middle line:90%
That makes disease real.

00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You great health.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: You treat health.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Create health,
disease goes away.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, the
proteins, the vegetables--

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm throwing that in
there-- and the fats,

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:90%
feed what part of the brain?

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Let's start with
the first fats than we ever had.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Breast milk is 40% DHA,
omega 3 fatty acids.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
essential fatty acids

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
because we can't get
them in our food.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:90%
So, we used to get it from fish.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But today's fish
are all farm raised,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
so they contain
minimal omega 3s.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason mother's
milk is so rich

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
in omega 3s is because
it repairs the brain.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The DHA and the omega
3s repair the brain.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have a
friend who's lactating,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:90%
you need to supplement.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.972 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why does the brain
need repairing at birth?

00:20:07.972 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: It needs growing.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It needs growing.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.315 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh,
it needs growing.

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And then later the pesticides
and the stress hormones,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the adrenaline and
the cortisol, they

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
damage a region in the brain
known as the hippocampus, which

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%
is where learning happens.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.375 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot learn how to
have a better relationship,

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
or how to feel better
about yourself,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
or how to create health if this
region in the brain is damaged.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is repaired by DHA.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:90%
DHA repairs this in six weeks.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
How do you get DHA as an
adult through foods that are,

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
many of them are in
contaminated by--

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, you need to
supplement with the omega 3s.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
DHA is one of the
omega 3 fatty acids.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So you need to take
your fish oils.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:55.584 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And again, you
cannot get it from the fish you

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
eat anymore because they're
raised on corn, on grain.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat fish
that's farm raised,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
you're eating
grains second hand.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can't get
vegetarian oils, right?

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.295 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah, you
can get it from seaweed.

00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
You can get DHA from seaweed.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the one that I take.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Seaweed.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.845 align:middle line:84%
Do you put that
in a green juice?

00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.205 align:middle line:84%
You actually get
the oil extract,

00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:90%
and you take it as a supplement.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And you need to take
3 to 5 grams a day

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:90%
to repair the hippocampus.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And today we all
have a broken brain.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.236 align:middle line:90%
Our brains are broken.

00:21:36.236 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just
recently have been

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
researching the phytoplankton
oils that you're talking about.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Is this what you take?

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, I take
the seaweed extract,

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:90%
the seaweed oils.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:90%
This is where fish make it from.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:90%
They eat seaweed.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then they turn
that into omega 3s.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.044 align:middle line:84%
So you can get it
directly from the seaweed.

00:21:59.044 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
went to the source,

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.672 align:middle line:84%
the veins of the ocean,
basically is the seaweed.

00:22:02.672 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's what
you think is contributing

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.629 align:middle line:84%
to the best possible use of
supplements for the brain.

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: The omega 3s,
regardless of how you get it.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Fish oils, for those of you
who are not vegetarians,

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:90%
get the cod liver oil.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Get the omega 3 capsules, 3 to
5 grams a day within six weeks

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
repairs the hippocampus.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.077 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn
how to create health.

00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we've covered the fats.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Now what about other
types of supplements

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that are great for the brain?

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: The brain loves
the fats, and particularly

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
coconut oil, olive oil, almonds,
avocados, all the natural fats.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It loves it.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, coconut oil is a
medium chain triglyceride.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Means that it goes directly
to your mitochondria,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
to the fuel factories
in your brain cells.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:90%
And the brain loves it.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.232 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you take a medium
chain triglyceride by itself?

00:22:58.232 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.898 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so just
the oil itself.

00:23:00.898 --> 00:23:03.585 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: A scoop of coconut
oil, I put it in my coffee

00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: And it's delicious.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great new trend.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And whipping it up,
you can make a latte with it,

00:23:09.545 --> 00:23:10.504 align:middle line:90%
but it feeds the brain.

00:23:10.504 --> 00:23:12.003 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It feeds
the brain food.

00:23:12.003 --> 00:23:13.055 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate is brain food.

00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But you got to be
careful with the sugar.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.451 align:middle line:84%
You want to get the 70
to 80% dark chocolate.

00:23:20.451 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It has medium

>>LISA: Really?

00:23:24.065 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the propensity

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to gain weight from
eating too much?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
How much would cause
you to gain weight?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:90%
How much is too much?

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.342 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Fats
don't make you fat.

00:23:34.342 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They won't,
no matter what.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: They will
not make you fat.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter how.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Look at people that
live in the Arctic.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
All they live on is
whale fat and blubber.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Fats don't make you fat.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Carbs make you fat.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Carbs turn into sugar.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Sugars are stored as fat.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're
having a carb craving,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do would be
to switch to something that has

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.515 align:middle line:90%
a medium chain triglyceride.

00:23:59.515 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.681 align:middle line:84%
If you're having a carb craving,
like you want that chocolate

00:24:02.681 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
chip cookie really, really bad,
it's not you who wants it--

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the chips,
the corn chips.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It's basically,
it's your gut flora.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The microbes in your
flora, they are 90%

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:90%
of who we are, 90% of our DNA.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%
They outnumber us 10 to 1.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who
want the chocolate chip

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.085 align:middle line:84%
cookie, because you've got
the wrong kind of microbes

00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that are addicted to sugar.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you cannot change your
food cravings unless you change

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
your flora, your probiotics, and
that's where you have to begin.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to begin
with the colony,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:90%
because we're a colony organism.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we'll begin
with eliminating grains,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
then go to the
fats for the brain.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about the gut.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk more about this.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.961 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the difference
between a probiotic

00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:51.929 align:middle line:90%
and a prebiotic?

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Is there one?

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Probiotics
are living creatures,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and we have over
600 species of flora

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of microbes, good microbes.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And microbes, we have a
symbiotic relationship with,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%
not parasitic.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Those we get sick
from, symbiotic.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And humans are
colony organisms so

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have hijacked the DNA
of the 600 species of microbes

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to put them to work for us.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They produce
vitamins, nutrients.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:32.125 align:middle line:84%
Humans, we only have 25,
26,000 genes in our DNA.

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:36.850 align:middle line:84%
A grain of rice has
80,000, much more complex

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
than humans are because we
rely on the colony to produce

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:90%
vitamin C, to digest foods.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we
contribute to digestion

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is peristalsis, little bit of
movement and stomach acids.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The bugs do the
rest of the work.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So eating
rice could disrupt

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that naturally
digestive process,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
according to what you
were just talking about?

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Eating rice is going to be
great if it's good, whole grain

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:90%
brown rice.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to disrupt
the process, because an earth

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:90%
worm has 60,000 genes.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:90%
We only have 25,000.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Nature's experimenting
with humans as a colony,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
not as a single
stand-alone organism.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And 90% of the colony is not us.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever wake
up in the morning

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.712 align:middle line:84%
and you're not quite
feeling yourself,

00:26:33.712 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
it's because you're not.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.742 align:middle line:90%
Because 90% of you is not you.

00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's Been

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It's been colonized
by these helpful organisms.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you
take an antibiotic,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:90%
you're destroying the colony.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Even one dose of
antibiotic can throw off

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%
your colony for the
rest of your life

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
so that you get food allergies.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You get sensitivities
to pollen, to the things

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that you could
eliminate if you were

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
to re-settle the colony with
the right microorganisms.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you did this.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.242 align:middle line:84%
You basically had parasites
and worms and all sorts of--

00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: That's
where I started.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you started
with re-colonizing

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:90%
your liver, your gut.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah, totally.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you do that?

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: I did
that with probiotics.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What kind?

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Probiotics
are basically

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:90%
the good bugs that we have.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Prebiotics are the things
that the probiotics eat.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's what feeds them.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But remember, when
you eat food, they're

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the ones that eat first.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They eat first, and then they
give you the metabolized food.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
They turn what's
not you into you.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And are these the higher
stomach or the lower stomach?

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: They're
actually in the GI tract.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:90%

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so after you've
broken down the food then

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
they--

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: After
you, your stomach

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
turns around with
digestive acids,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
then they get to work on it.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they take all the
nutrients out of the food

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.412 align:middle line:84%
so that they can be absorbed
through your GI tract

00:28:08.412 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and through your bloodstream.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a mood
disorder, for example,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and you have the wrong
flora, the wrong microbes,

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.450 align:middle line:84%
you're reacting to their poop,
to their waste product that's

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:90%
toxic to the brain.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you're trying
to medicate the brain

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:90%
without changing the gut.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm tracking
here, the oils first

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and then a good probiotic.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.027 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is now, there's a
million out there on the market

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
based in dairy.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Can I
recommend a brand?

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.063 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: OK, the
best brand in the market

00:28:45.063 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%
is called Ascended Health.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Ascended Health, and you can
get them at ascendedhealth.com.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What makes it the best?

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
they're harvested

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
from the blue zones around the
planet, the longevity zones.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're living probiotics.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.254 align:middle line:84%
Most of the ones we get
in the market are dead.

00:29:03.254 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, even
though they say a billion.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Billions
and billions.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
This is like sending in
the Navy Seals instead

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:90%
of 100 billion dead.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're extraordinary.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:84%
They're so potent you
can only take five drops.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And in a month, they can
re-settle the colony.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can do
this after antibiotics.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: This is
essential you do it after.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But this is what the shamans do
to be able to repair the gut,

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to repair the brain,
to reach the higher

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness
where they can create

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
psychosomatic
health, and then they

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:90%
can train the world into be.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's take
it from the micro

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
to the macro conversation here,
because I appreciate that.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
how the details,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
but do the shamans
take the probiotics,

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.805 align:middle line:90%
or do they really just heal?

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh,
take the probiotics.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.638 align:middle line:90%
They buy them through Amazon.

00:29:57.638 --> 00:29:58.888 align:middle line:90%
They're for the Amazon, right?

00:29:58.888 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.976 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's perfect.

00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But you know
where the probiotics

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:90%
come from originally?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
organic garden, you

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.400 align:middle line:90%
don't need to take probiotics.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because you're--

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.108 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Because
they're in your food.

00:30:14.108 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
When you pull out a carrot,
it's full of probiotics.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just eat it raw.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Eating it raw--

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.766 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You're reading in
raw right out of the garden.

00:30:22.766 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You're eating a tremendous
amount of probiotics.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to order it
from your local health food

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.511 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:32.609 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And gardens these
days, you can do so many things

00:30:32.609 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:90%
with gardens.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.108 align:middle line:84%
You can create gardens
in a box and stack them.

00:30:35.108 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: It's incredible.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Be sure that you get
clean fertilizer,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.302 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise
you're taking toxins in.

00:30:42.302 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But that's where you
get your probiotics.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's how we
used to stay healthy.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, we used to
have this incredible health

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:84%
maintenance thing
called a garden, called

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:90%
the backyard actually.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And we used to put
things in our mouth

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and put dirt in our mouths.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But today, we want our
children to be sterile.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have them, and
we have sterile guts

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.672 align:middle line:84%
that are the cost of so
many of our food allergies.

00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the immune system
doesn't have a chance to work

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:90%

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: It does not.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --building itself.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
world, though,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:84%
because hand sanitizers
and all the things

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that we do, because
these superbugs out there

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.545 align:middle line:90%
are so strong.

00:31:27.545 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh yeah.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But yet
at the same time,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
we haven't empowered our immune
system yet to fight them.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.847 align:middle line:84%
But with that said, that would
have taken years to do, right?

00:31:36.847 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
We have weaker immune
systems now, don't we?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah, we do.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.380 align:middle line:90%
But we can strengthen them.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, 80% of our
immune system is in our gut.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.986 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So if you
can strengthen the gut,

00:31:46.986 --> 00:31:48.985 align:middle line:84%
you're actually strengthening
the immune system.

00:31:48.985 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to talk about later

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is how you can upgrade the
quality of the information

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:84%
in your field so that you can
upgrade your immune system

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
by downloading the
codes directly instead

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.084 align:middle line:84%
of by having to get sick
to train the immune system.

00:32:05.084 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so this has to do
with the luminous body, yes.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you take a
look at a video first talking

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.174 align:middle line:90%
about the luminous body.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
-The Luminous Body,
the way of the shaman,

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.922 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Alberto Villoldo.

00:32:16.922 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:84%
In this fascinating
and informative DVD,

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Alberto Villoldo
introduces viewers

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to the luminous energy field
that surounds and informs

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
our physical body like
a blueprint of life.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.170 align:middle line:84%
-This luminous
energy field is what

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
contains the imprints of
our early life experiences,

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:84%
of genetically
inherited illnesses,

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:84%
even of memories before we
were born, when we were still

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:90%
in the uterus and before.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.575 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to perceive
the luminous energy field,

00:32:54.575 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
we learn to perceive the
luminous nature of life.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The visual spectrum,
what the eye can see,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is a very narrow band of the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:90%
very, very small.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of what's happening
in the universe

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is happening outside
of the visual spectrum.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to perceive
with our inner eyes,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
with the eyes that can perceive
the luminous nature of life,

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
we recognize our
interconnectedness

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
with all things, with the
stars, with the rivers,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
with the mountains, with the
valleys, with each other.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:84%
-Unveiling the secret of
ancient shaman healers,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
he teaches us that many of
our physical and psychological

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:84%
problems stem from imprints
within our luminous body.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Villoldo reveals the
nature of this luminous field,

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:84%
how it acts as a blueprint
for our physical body,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and how by
understanding its nature

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
we can actually heal
ourselves and each other.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Once the luminous body is
clear, Dr. Villoldo explains,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.998 align:middle line:84%
physical and emotional
healing can begin.

00:33:56.998 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Trained as a medical
anthropologist,

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Villoldo left the academic
world behind 20 years ago

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to study among the
ancient shamans.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It was in the Andes
Mountains of South America

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that he discovered the
wisdom of the luminous body

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:90%
from the indiginous shamans.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.834 align:middle line:84%
This ancient knowledge
reveals the secret

00:34:17.834 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:90%
of true health and happiness.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
To aid Dr. Villoldo in
explaining the luminous energy

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:84%
field, the paintings of
visionary artist Alex Grey

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.724 align:middle line:90%
are presented.

00:34:26.724 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:84%
No other artist has
depicted the luminous energy

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:84%
form in all of its intricacies
as clearly as Alex Grey.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Villoldo's
presentation, together

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
with Alex Grey's
images, helps all of us

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to understand the nature of
our spiritual and physical

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.248 align:middle line:90%
well-being.

00:34:49.248 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
-And today, we're training
people from all cuts of life

00:34:55.909 --> 00:35:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to learn to heal themselves,
to learn to heal each other,

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:90%
and to learn to heal the world.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is who the shaman is.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:90%
We are caretakers of the earth.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And my mission is to
train Western shamans that

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
can dream a dream of
healing and of peace.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:84%
-Many of our illnesses, the
psychological disorders,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
addictions, and
failed relationships

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
can be traced to faulty
imprints in our luminous body.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In this DVD, Dr. Villoldo
unvels how to heal and recover

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:84%
from these destructive
imprints and how

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to regain our physical, mental,
and spiritual well-being.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so we just watched
a video on the luminous body

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and on our outside of our body.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But what's the connection
between what we eminate

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and what goes on
inside our brains?

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, the
luminous energy field

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is a blueprint that
organizes the body

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the same way that a
magnet organizes iron

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:90%
filings on a piece of glass.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's a matrix.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interface between
the luminous energy

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
field and the physical body is
the brain and nervous system.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the command center.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.200 align:middle line:84%
If your brain is
damaged, if it's broken,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
let me give you a
frightening statistic.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
If you live to be 85
years old in America,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.677 align:middle line:84%
you have a 50% chance of
having diagnosable Alzheimer's.

00:36:24.677 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which you'll
detect way before that.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Which
already the deterioration

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
will begin way before.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:90%
50%.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the year 1900,
Alzheimer's was not even known.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't been discovered yet.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
In today, one in two Americans
will get some form of cancer.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.375 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1900, less than
3% of Americans got cancer.

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One in two
Americans will get cancer.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: One
in two Americans.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: 50% of Americans
will get cancer.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.802 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does
that contribute to?

00:36:57.802 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: 120 years
ago less than 3%,

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
so we're having a health
crisis that's extraordinary.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's due to many,
many-- it's hard to say,

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:90%
this is the source.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we cannot
create psychosomatic health,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:90%
the levels of stress toxins.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
In 1900, everything you ate
was free range and organic.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
make a difference.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So today we need to be able
to rely on the brain's ability

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.382 align:middle line:84%
to create health, to create
psychosomatic health.

00:37:29.382 --> 00:37:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
that several times.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.298 align:middle line:90%
What is psychosomatic health.

00:37:32.298 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Psychosomatic
health is how you can envision,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
you can dream your
health into being

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:90%
through use of your intention.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, you have
to access the higher brain.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So just to wrap up the brain,
no sugars, no dairy, no gluten.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Fats and proteins is what
you want to feed it on.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And eliminate grains
from your diet.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And within a month, you can
actually grow a new brain.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:90%
You can renew your neurons.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the process that
does this is a substance

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.620 align:middle line:84%
called BDNF-- Brain-Derived
Neurotropic Factors.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Because when you and
I went to college,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:84%
we thought that every
shot of tequila we

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.727 align:middle line:84%
had meant that we
wiped out 20,000--

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brain cells.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: --neurons.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Today we've discovered that
the brain produces stem cells

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
actually trigger

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:84%
the production of stem cells in
the brain to grow new neurons.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:90%
This is how I grew a new brain.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is the
news of the century.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So, you don't have to
take the stem cells.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So many questions.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.814 align:middle line:90%
Wait, let's go back, coffee.

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:90%
You didn't add coffee.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:90%
What about coffee and alcohol?

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.074 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me about those two.

00:38:40.074 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
alcohol, forget it.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.302 align:middle line:84%
Coffee is actually an
amazing detoxifier.

00:38:47.302 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But your fight or flight
system has to be tranquil.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.836 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, it'll
just hype you up.

00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And the way you can
tell the difference

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.580 align:middle line:84%
is if you get jittery
and hyped up with coffee,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
you need to first go back and
reset the fight or flight.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of it is that
it's a great detoxifier.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.260 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the top detoxifiers.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But you need to use it
wisely with no sugar.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And no cream.

00:39:11.539 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: And no cream.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.205 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of course
because of the dairy.

00:39:14.205 --> 00:39:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But what about if you eat
protein along with coffee.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Would it neutralize it?

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.814 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:39:17.814 --> 00:39:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.005 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:39:19.005 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Coffee doesn't neutralize.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it detoxifies.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: What coffee
does is that it triggers

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:84%
a detox pathway called
the Nrf2 detox pathway,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Nrf2, which gets cells,
the inside of the cells,

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.580 align:middle line:90%
to release toxins.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Most of the detoxification
programs we do

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:84%
are cleaning out the filters,
the liver or the kidneys.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:47.232 align:middle line:84%
But you want to get the
junk that's inside the cell.

00:39:47.232 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You want to get that out.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And coffee, and broccoli
seeds, curcumin,

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
curry are wonderful detoxifiers
of the inside of the cell.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you get the junk
out, then your mitochondria

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.155 align:middle line:84%
can begin to recover
their health.

00:40:05.155 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
talking with someone

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
who does the green coffee
enemas as a way of detoxifying

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.310 align:middle line:90%
the liver.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of this?

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yes.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.559 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But the liver
is one of the filters.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And you need to do
that first, but you

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:90%
want to detoxify brain cells.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter how many
times you clear your liver,

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the brain fog is not
going to go away.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It's important
that you clean the liver.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But the detoxifiers that do
that, we know what they are.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Coffee is one of them.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.275 align:middle line:90%
Curcumin is another one.

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eat some broccoli--

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Broccoli
seeds, extraordinary.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Sulforaphane is the
active ingredient,

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and it'll trigger
cellular detox.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
When you detox the
inside of the cell,

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
your mitochondria, the fuel
factories, begin to repair.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondria
don't belong to us.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They are actually microbes that
integrated into our own cells.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And they are responsible
for producing energy,

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.330 align:middle line:84%
but they also set
the death clock.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They are charged with the
death clock inside cells.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They tell cells when
they need to die.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they're not
functioning properly,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:84%
you have cells that believe
that they can live forever.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And what do we call those cells?

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Cancer.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Cancers are cells that don't
know that they need to die.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:84%
When you reset the
mitochondrial death clock,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.380 align:middle line:90%
new set of instruction goes out.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have cells
that die too quickly, which

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:90%
makes you age too rapidly.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So you want to clean out
the inside of the cell

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to restore
mitochondria to have

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:90%
your energy be at its prime.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And over 200
illnesses, including

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:84%
cancer, cardiovascular
disease, dementia,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's, are related to
mitochondrial dysfunction

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
because of toxins
inside the cell.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
clearing the toxins.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you clear the
liver, which the blood

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.260 align:middle line:84%
filters through the liver,
what, once every four

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:90%
minutes or something like that?

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you cleansing
the blood in the cells

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:90%
by cleansing the liver?

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, you're
cleansing the blood.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Blood is a transport system.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So you're cleansing
the river, but you've

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:84%
got to get the
factory way upstream

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:90%
to stop polluting the river.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so it'll
continue to-- OK.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I was thinking,
if you cleanse the blood,

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:90%
it'll just cleanse the brain.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.425 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: No.

00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The blood will not
get inside the cell.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
See, the cell doesn't
have any blood in it.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The cell is like
a little sphere,

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and it releases its waste
into the bloodstream.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And it takes nutrients
from the blood.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So when the waste builds up
too much inside the cell,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.769 align:middle line:90%
it damages your mitochondria.

00:42:49.769 --> 00:42:51.976 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These are certain
cells, because there's also

00:42:51.976 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:90%
blood cells, right?

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, there are many
kinds of cells in your body.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.175 align:middle line:90%
You have brain cells.

00:42:58.175 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:90%
You have blood cells.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:42:59.995 align:middle line:90%
You have bone cells.

00:42:59.995 --> 00:43:01.875 align:middle line:90%
You have muscle cells.

00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're talking
about specifically--

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But we want to
specifically detoxify the brain

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.270 align:middle line:84%
so you can dream your world
into being and your health

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.995 align:middle line:90%
into being.

00:43:10.995 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.077 align:middle line:84%
So you want to go
after the brain cells.

00:43:14.077 --> 00:43:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Neurons.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, you talked about
the psychosomatic health.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Is cleansing the brain
cell more effectively done

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.600 align:middle line:84%
through the health
measures you're talking

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:90%
about or through your thoughts?

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Which is more powerful?

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: You have to do both.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to first get the
junk out of the cells,

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to get the
junk out of your mind.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can't get the
junk out of your mind

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.990 align:middle line:84%
unless you get the junk
out of the cells first.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking, I
should have paid that bill.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I've got to respond
to these emails,

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm so upset with my-- you
can't get that garbage out

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:84%
unless you get the
physical garbage out first.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And how much does exercise
contribute to detoxifying brain

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:90%
cells?

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Exercise
is fabulous.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.440 align:middle line:90%
You need to exercise.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:90%
It contributes.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But what the shamans
have all discovered

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:84%
were the plants that helped
you to detoxify the brain

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and trigger the production of
new neurons, neural stem cells,

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:90%
so you could grow a new brain.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they learned how
to switch the brain on

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to download
the codes for a new human

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.620 align:middle line:90%
from the luminous energy field.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole nother topic.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into that.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Downloading the
codes of a new human

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to the luminous energy
field, what does that mean?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: OK, so, we have DNA.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.470 align:middle line:90%
We know what DNA is.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
luminous energy field.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.900 align:middle line:90%
DNA is a hardware.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And the luminous energy
field is a software.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: So, the problem
is that we're upgrading

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:90%
the software all the time.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Nature's informing us.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.885 align:middle line:84%
The field is connected
to everything.

00:45:03.885 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:84%
To everything in the cosmos, so
it gets upgraded all the time.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But what translates
that upgrade is

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:84%
the brain and nervous system,
and then the DNA gets it,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
gets new instructions, because
DNA only manufactures proteins.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing DNA does.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're a
protein-based life form.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:90%
This is protein.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you upgrade the field
to version 7.1 of the software,

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be able to
transmit that to the DNA

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
so that you can not
just heal and repair

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.295 align:middle line:84%
but literally grow a new body,
grow a new liver, a new heart,

00:45:41.295 --> 00:45:43.037 align:middle line:90%
a new brain.

00:45:43.037 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's the hardware.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And that's
what the hardware can do.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
update the hardware

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:90%
by updating the software.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So you update the physical body
by updating the luminous field.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.405 align:middle line:84%
Luminous field is updated
automatically all the time.

00:45:58.405 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:84%
You know how your computer
gets automatic updates

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.925 align:middle line:90%
on the software?

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The luminous energy field,
because it's a field,

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:08.670 align:middle line:90%
it extends to infinity.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it can be
updated with malware.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:90%
That's was sorcerers do.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Sorcerers will
insert some malware,

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:84%
will insert bad
instructions into your field

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and trigger the expression of
a gene that creates cancer.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And they'll harm, they'll
kill someone that way.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Seriously.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh yeah.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw this when I was an
anthropologist in Haiti,

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:33.590 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.724 align:middle line:90%
Voodoo works that way.

00:46:35.724 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to go
punch you in the face.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
tweak your energy

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
field to express a gene that
will create a breast condition.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.660 align:middle line:90%
You've seen this.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh yeah.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.095 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this also,
but we call it stress.

00:46:50.095 --> 00:46:52.685 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very well said, yes.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So, does that take a certain
level of skill to do?

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking this question
because you can also

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.530 align:middle line:84%
do the same thing the
opposite way, where

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:09.692 align:middle line:84%
you can insert a program through
the luminous energy field--

00:47:09.692 --> 00:47:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.344 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that could
reverse a cancer

00:47:12.344 --> 00:47:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and that could cause health.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.884 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But that's what
teach our students how to do.

00:47:15.884 --> 00:47:19.390 align:middle line:84%
What I do today is to train
modern shamans in the practice

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:21.230 align:middle line:90%
of energy medicine.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And energy medicine has
to do with upgrading

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the
information in the field

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to create the conditions
for health energetically

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:84%
so the body can
eliminate disease.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And we train practitioners in a
very ancient modality of energy

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.300 align:middle line:84%
medicine that is actually
very modern, because physics

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:90%
has finally explained it.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:52.809 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so, I'm still a little
bit stuck on the voodoo magic,

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk
about that for a second.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.264 align:middle line:84%
Because that is an
ancient art that's

00:47:57.264 --> 00:47:58.430 align:middle line:90%
been around for a long time.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And did those shamans have
to train in a certain form

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.240 align:middle line:90%
in order to have that?

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You know, when you
have-- voodoo's actually also

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.830 align:middle line:84%
a very elevated form of
healing, but it has--

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.494 align:middle line:90%
the practitioners go both ways.

00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It has the
darkness to it.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It has a dark
side and a light side.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But life has a dark
side and a light side.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
There's so much black magic
being practiced in corporations

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:22.830 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
going to bring that up.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Sabotaging each
other, undermining each other.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Undermining our planet.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.408 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO:
Undermining the planet.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you send anger
or rage at someone,

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.905 align:middle line:84%
it's like sending
a psychic dark.

00:48:35.905 --> 00:48:37.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like doing black magic.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:39.274 align:middle line:90%
You're hurting someone.

00:48:39.274 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you send
love to someone,

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.540 align:middle line:90%
it's a beautiful blessing.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's information
that goes into the field.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
interesting because you

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:49.870 align:middle line:84%
talk about social movements
towards cleaning up

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:84%
our environment and
so forth and some

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
of the injustices in the
world that are being done.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't those
shamans take out

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
people that are human
trafficking and that

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.250 align:middle line:84%
are throwing massive
loads of toxic waste

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:90%
into our environment?

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You can not
actually heal somebody

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:09.150 align:middle line:90%
without their consent.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But you can harm somebody
without their consent.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
when you practice

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
with a certain level of ethics,
you can not work on anyone

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.860 align:middle line:90%
without their consent.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can heal or harm
someone without their consent,

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.765 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is that
you take on their karma.

00:49:26.765 --> 00:49:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
high price you pay.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
to be fixing people

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.840 align:middle line:90%
without getting their approval.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting I say
the whole thing consciously

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:84%
because those types of shamans
that are trained enough

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.079 align:middle line:84%
to do something like
that have to understand

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:90%
the karmic ramifications.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.129 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Oh yeah.

00:49:45.129 --> 00:49:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we
teach our students

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is the ethics and
the intentionality.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Intentionality without
ethics can get you

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.230 align:middle line:90%
into a lot of trouble.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For lifetimes.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Absolutely, yeah.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about now the healing

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.820 align:middle line:90%
aspects of modern shamans.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So, you train modern people to
become these types of healers

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.872 align:middle line:90%
for their own bodies, right?

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, the
way that the shaman

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:14.370 align:middle line:84%
learns how to become a healer
is by healing themselves.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So you learn the techniques by
going through your own healing.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And the very first one is
you learn that your deepest

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.520 align:middle line:84%
wounds are also your sources of
greatest power and compassion.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.926 align:middle line:84%
So as you heal from
these very deep wounds,

00:50:30.926 --> 00:50:32.360 align:middle line:90%
your compassion awakens.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You know what it is to
hurt, so you understand

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.790 align:middle line:90%
somebody else's pain.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through
your own healing

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:45.300 align:middle line:84%
by clearing the
imprints for disease

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.990 align:middle line:90%
from your luminous energy field.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you do this?

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: And first let me
tell you what the imprints are.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.060 align:middle line:90%
The imprints are two types.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.140 align:middle line:84%
One of them are genetic so
that if heart disease runs

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.130 align:middle line:84%
in the family it's
also in the field.

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And the other are karmic that
we bring from former lifetimes.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are packets of
information in the field

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that the shamans learn how
to clear out so you would not

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
have to replay the same
illnesses and the same family

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:90%
dramas that your parents did.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.579 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And those shamans
are doing this-- of course

00:51:20.579 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:84%
they're skilled in doing it,
but they're working specifically

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.380 align:middle line:90%
on the luminous energy field.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: They're
working on the field.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.426 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they
are trained to be

00:51:27.426 --> 00:51:28.939 align:middle line:90%
able to see what the blocks are.

00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah And
we train our students.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.310 align:middle line:84%
They are able to
perceive the field

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:35.110 align:middle line:90%
after six months of training.

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you could look,
you, yourself, Alberto,

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.630 align:middle line:84%
could look at someone right now
and see in my energy field what

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.599 align:middle line:90%
needs to be repaired.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yes, I could.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You could.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.247 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: But I
need your permission.

00:51:46.247 --> 00:51:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like there would
be a ceremony or a session

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:84%
around it that allows you to
be able to go into that state,

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.080 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Basically you
switch perceptual states.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you're not seeing
the obvious and the apparent,

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:84%
but you're reading the
energy in the field.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And they have stories
that are attached to it

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:84%
so that all of
your past, you hold

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.890 align:middle line:84%
your past in the form of stories
that I can read in your field

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and tell you, ah,
this happened to you,

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:16.820 align:middle line:90%
or you remember this happening.

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.430 align:middle line:84%
To me, not it really
happened to you,

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.660 align:middle line:84%
but you believe that
it did because you

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:90%
created a story around it.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you go
through your healing,

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.740 align:middle line:84%
then you change the story
around whatever happened to you.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Our stories are
so powerful that they

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.070 align:middle line:90%
can change our DNA.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Totally.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so, as much as
they can change our DNA,

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.447 align:middle line:84%
we can unchange them
by undoing the story.

00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: In fact,
that's one of the keys.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You change the story,
you change your life,

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.400 align:middle line:90%
you change your genetics.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:90%
What was your story?

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Why did you get into the
riddlement of the parasites?

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever discover that?

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well,
I remember one time

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.260 align:middle line:84%
we were in the Southwest
in Canyon de Chelly,

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and there was an old
Navajo medicine woman.

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
Alberto-- we had

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.020 align:middle line:90%
become friends over the years.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And one day she said,
what's your story, Alberto?

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about yourself.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, my father left
home when I was very young,

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and I never had a really
positive role model of what

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.670 align:middle line:90%
it was like to be a man.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
looking for that.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.660 align:middle line:90%
She goes, hm.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, well,
what's your story?

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about yourself.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And she says, the
Red Rock Canyon

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.360 align:middle line:84%
walls am I. The
desert wind am I.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The child that not eat today at
the reservation am I. And I go,

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:84%
How much better of a story than
little boy looking for daddy?

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Any way, the end of
the story is that I

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:51.238 align:middle line:84%
was catching an airplane the
following day to go back to LA.

00:53:51.238 --> 00:53:55.674 align:middle line:84%
And in an airplane, you don't
talk to the person next to you

00:53:55.674 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:84%
until you're almost
ready to land.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And the man next to me says,
well, tell me, what do you do?

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:90%
What's your story?

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I go, the Red Rock Canyon
walls am I. The desert wind.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh my god.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:90%
He changed seats.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course I wasn't
any of those things.

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I was still a lost little boy.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I healed
myself and I healed that story

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that I could become
the desert wind

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.645 align:middle line:84%
and I could identify with that
child that did not eat today.

00:54:25.645 --> 00:54:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot change your story
simply by writing up a better

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:32.660 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It has to be cellular.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.690 align:middle line:90%
It has to be in your field.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you said you have
to get rid of the old emotions.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: You got to
get rid of the emotion.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.576 align:middle line:90%
They're all wrapped in emotion.

00:54:42.576 --> 00:54:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
bring in the feelings.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Mm-hmm.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so triggering
and the emotions

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to any wrongness or story
that we're holding onto

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:56.250 align:middle line:84%
can be replaced by a different
feeling around that event.

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: It simply
becomes a memory.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.095 align:middle line:84%
It happened to
someone, but it was not

00:55:02.095 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you, because at that point,
that you that you thought

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.540 align:middle line:90%
you were no longer exists.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, because my
authenticity meter went up

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.351 align:middle line:84%
there, and that was
not truthful for me.

00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But what was the last
thing you just said?

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.308 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, that you
that you thought you were,

00:55:17.308 --> 00:55:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that wounded little
boy looking for daddy,

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.970 align:middle line:84%
was not really who
you really were.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:84%
You were much bigger than that,
but you had become attached.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:28.737 align:middle line:84%
I had become attached to that
story of the wounded boy.

00:55:28.737 --> 00:55:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.797 align:middle line:90%
So you replaced that with what?

00:55:31.797 --> 00:55:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: With a better story.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is?

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Well, the story of
my life has been the explorer.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've been an explorer
of consciousness.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I started out in a
brain research laboratory

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.090 align:middle line:84%
at San Francisco
State University

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and ended up in the
rainforests of the world.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And many of the anthropologists
that I met at that time

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:90%
were dead.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.570 align:middle line:90%
The jungle is very clean.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a very pristine
and clean place.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go through the
last outpost of the white man's

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:09.670 align:middle line:90%
filth.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the white man
is the only individual

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:16.705 align:middle line:84%
or people that
contaminate their nest

00:56:16.705 --> 00:56:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and that poison their own well.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was in those
malaria-infected regions,

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.190 align:middle line:84%
mosquito-ridden regions
that I picked up

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:30.847 align:middle line:84%
all of these parasites that took
me to meet my possible death.

00:56:30.847 --> 00:56:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was your last hope.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Three
years ago, yeah.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.430 align:middle line:90%
And then I changed my story.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
three years ago?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VILLOLDO: Three
years ago, yeah.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.963 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was it?

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Yeah.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.159 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's so much more
to talk about with you.

00:56:45.159 --> 00:56:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is just going
to be a cliffhanger,

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.540 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
have to have a part two.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Alberto Villoldo is going to
join me for another interview

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.470 align:middle line:84%
because there's still
so much more to cover.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And you are just a
wealth of information,

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.524 align:middle line:84%
so I'd love it if you'd
stay for another hour.

00:56:59.524 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VILLOLDO: Thank you.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.041 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:57:02.041 --> 00:57:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you would like to watch
a replay of this interview,

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.060 align:middle line:90%
please do.

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
gaiamtv.com and learn

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.590 align:middle line:90%
so much from Dr. Villoldo.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we can continue on
for another interview as well.

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I invite
you to stay inspired.
