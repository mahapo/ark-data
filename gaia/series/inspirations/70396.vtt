00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you experiencing any of
these symptoms-- fatigue,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:84%
bloating, depression,
weight gain, hair loss,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:90%
thinning eyebrows, or brain fog?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Have you tried various
supplements and medications

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.054 align:middle line:84%
for digestion and
thyroid disease,

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and either they haven't
worked, or you've just

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
had to increase the
medication so much

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:90%
that you are on that track.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we're
talking about today

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
very, very helpful.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Because an estimated
20 million Americans

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
have some form of
thyroid disease

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and they suffer from the
symptoms that I just mentioned.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Dr. Gil Kajiki.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And he's from the Valley
Thyroid Institute,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
where he has been
helping people reverse

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
many of the symptoms
of thyroiditis.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GIL KAJIKI: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.172 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
the thyroid gland itself.

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, let me talk about
about that statistic I just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.412 align:middle line:84%
Is it true 20 million, or is it
more, less, in your experience?

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's probably more.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
20 million, which people
get off the internet,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:84%
it's probably just the
diagnosed conditions.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
cases of undiagnosed

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that that doesn't even
reach the statistics.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's about, it
could be anywhere between--

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: 50--

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GIL KAJIKI: 100 million.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: People that contact you.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.809 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
function of the thyroid gland.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.454 align:middle line:90%
Where is it located?

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:36.828 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well,
the thyroid gland

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
is a little butterfly
shaped gland located

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
right in front of
your throat here.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And the thyroid gland is the
spark plug for metabolism.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%
That's where it all starts.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So everything starts at
that spark plug right there.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
But that spark plug controls
every cell in the entire body.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
It controls the metabolism and
mesobolic rate for everything

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.582 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:01:57.582 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that
including hormones,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:90%
or is it just metabolism?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Including hormones.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in the
body has something

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
called a thyroid receptor site.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a little garage
for that thyroid hormone.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:90%
And every cell has that.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.915 align:middle line:84%
So if that car
doesn't work right,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
or that cell doesn't work
right, or that receptor doesn't

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
work right, you don't get
proper hormone function.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So every cell,
three million or whatever,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
trillion cells are in your
body has a little receptor

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
site that that tiny
little gland emits.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.577 align:middle line:90%
Is it a hormone?

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: A hormone.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The hormone that the thyroid
travels through the body

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.867 align:middle line:84%
to get to that cell to make
that cell function properly.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's about cell function,
metabolism, hormone balance,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.935 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Absolutely.

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:42.107 align:middle line:84%
So when your thyroid goes bad,
everything starts to go bad.

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
why I was mentioning

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
all those, that laundry list
of items that we're going over.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:84%
How does it relate to the
hair loss, and the dry skin,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.514 align:middle line:84%
and the lower third of
the eyebrows coming out.

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
What does that
have to do with it?

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, the problem with
symptoms is that a lot of them

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
overlap each other.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So just thyroid,
poor thyroid function

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
alone could give you
all those symptoms.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But so could female
hormone imbalance.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got these
mixture of different symptoms

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that you really never know
where is it coming from.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.703 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:14.655 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So it's a
very complex condition.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do people
ever make the mistake

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
of addressing the female
hormone problem first, and not

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
addressing the thyroid?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Absolutely.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And all depend upon
which doctor you go to.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose the
doctor you go to.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And you think it's hormone, then
you go to the hormone doctor.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The hormone doctor's going
to find a hormone problem.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.782 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.711 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: If you go to
the endocrinologist,

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the endocrinologist
will find a--

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thyroid problem.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.803 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Thyroid problem.

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So this actually can help
with the hormone issue

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.904 align:middle line:84%
if you fix the thyroid or
treat the thyroid first.

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I will tell
you that the thyroid has

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
a very strong influence over all
the male and female hormones,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
very strong influence.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we don't know if
it's the chicken or the egg.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Both have an influence
on each other.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, obviously, you
can't fix one without the other

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.695 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's a
little off balance.

00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's talk about
the underdiagnosed portion

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
of the statistics that
we mentioned earlier.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
What are the ranges based
on in an average blood test

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.375 align:middle line:90%
or thyroid test?

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well,
there's something

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
called pathological ranges,
which is the lab test

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
range that you get
with the blood test.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
taken note on that,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
if you've gone to
several labs, you'll

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.825 align:middle line:84%
notice that the ranges
differ from lab to lab.

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, I wouldn't
have known that.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.791 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Yes, which
is very strange.

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the doctors tell
you you're in normal range.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Or you're out of normal range.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet how could the lab ranges
be different from one lab

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.102 align:middle line:90%
to another?

00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a
look at your labs,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the lab
ranges differ from one lab

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.451 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And they also
differ from one city or state

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the way they
get those lab ranges

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
are they take all the
people from last year.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.659 align:middle line:90%
They put them in a bell curve.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:90%
They throw out the highs.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:90%
They throw out the lows.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.024 align:middle line:90%
And this is the range.

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But now you have to
consider that range.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Who's actually in that range?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.527 align:middle line:84%
These are people who are on
medication, not on medication.

00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sick in the first place.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
came to the doctor.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.376 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's not really
a normal range.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.206 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call a
statistical average.

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's like
if you were to take

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
the obesity rate of a nation.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And you were to take last
year's average weight

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and make that the new norm.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.511 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That's exactly
what they're doing.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's why.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.047 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It doesn't make sense.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But because there's no
quote unquote "normal"

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that the standard of
medical care uses,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:90%
they use these averages.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.751 align:middle line:84%
Because it is different from
different parts of the country.

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.657 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that is acceptable.

00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Medically.

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:46.188 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:05:46.188 --> 00:05:50.052 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yet it's worth it to
educate ourselves about so we

00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
know why we're not feeling
well, even though our ranges are

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%
within--

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.002 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Absolutely.

00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The norm.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.952 align:middle line:90%
So what should the range be?

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So the
ranges should be--

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
we use what we call
functional lab ranges.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And functional
averages were developed

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
by health care practitioners
such as myself,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
where we look at
early detection.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We want to catch the problem
before it becomes a disease

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
By the time the pathological
ranges are overtaken,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
then it's a
pathological process.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But with a functional
range, it's much narrower.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's a tighter range.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.062 align:middle line:84%
So we can see
things that are just

00:06:23.062 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:90%
starting to become a problem.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we can decide if we're
going to jump on that right

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
away or not, rather than let it
get worse and worse and worse.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because the
longer that it's in place

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
without being treated, does
it make it harder to reverse?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: In a
lot of cases, yes.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way the medical
and drug community work

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
is there has to be a
certain number that lab

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
has to reach before they're
able to dispense medication

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
You're kidding.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.395 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes, yes.

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.446 align:middle line:84%
So early detection is the
best prevention at this point.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Absolutely.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's for anything.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's better to catch it and
then decide to work on it.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why
does the thyroid go

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:90%
into an attack mode on itself?

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
That's otherwise knows
as Hashimoto's, right?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right, right.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's an immune attack
of the immune system

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:90%
on the thyroid.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Why does it?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the million
dollar question there.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: But what we do know is
there's genetic predisposition.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of a bummer.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
There are uneducated
lifestyle choices.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: There are--

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk
about those today.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
There are poor food choices.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There are other
things like triggers

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that cause this
autoimmune attack.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's the case
of people just not even

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
knowing, not even knowing
it exists in their body.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, just feeling
fatigued, and tired,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and going after all those
supplements out there.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a supplement
for every single thing

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Memory.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:90%
For the brain fog.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got the
inflammation and all of that.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:90%
There's supplements for.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
There's antacids
and all of that.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's all fixable
from the outside in.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're not ever addressing
the root cause, right?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.466 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:00.966 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I find so
interesting, because there's

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
multi-billion dollar supplements
for every single thing

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.629 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:09.211 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.964 align:middle line:84%
And going back to your response
about under diagnose-- I mean,

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
the reason it gets
under diagnosed

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
is because the standard
for medical care

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
is fix the TSH
levels, and that's it.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So they'll do free
T3, free T4, TSH,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
but what about all
the other tests?

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
standard medical care.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:90%
So they go after fixing the TSH.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there might be
all these other underlying

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
problems, like an
autoimmune attack,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
that they don't even know about.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so these problems worsen
and worsen and worsen.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The body starts
breaking down more,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
and more, and more,
even though their lab

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.841 align:middle line:84%
ranges may be
within normal range.

00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's take
a look at this slide

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
here that kind of
explains a path-- which

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I love Dr. Kajiki's put this
into a really easy way for us

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.814 align:middle line:90%
to learn about it.

00:08:53.814 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:90%
So take a look at this here.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We've got the thyroid,
and the immune system,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation
completely linked here.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain this?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So in most cases, people come
see me for a thyroid problem.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Most of the cases of
thyroid are hypothyroid.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a sluggish, slow thyroid.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The way the doctors determine
it is a test called TSH.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.485 align:middle line:84%
That's your thyroid
stimulating hormone.

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:17.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:19.401 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Now it's
kind of strange

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:84%
because if the TSH is high,
you have a slow thyroid.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But if the TSH is low,
you have a fast thyroid.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's reversed.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's reversed.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
What you think of is
if it's hypo and slow,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
you want high stimulation.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.695 align:middle line:90%
That's why the TSH is high.

00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.362 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why those
types of people go

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.534 align:middle line:84%
for the coffee and
the stimulants.

00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More than, OK.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Because
they're sluggish.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.879 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So what we know
is that 70% to 90% of all

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the people who have hypothyroid
have a condition called

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune Hashimoto's.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 70%.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: 70 to 90% of all the
people who have hypothyroid.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're diagnosed
with high TSH, which

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
means you're going to get
medication, Synthroid,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
levothyroxine,
Armour, Nature-Throid.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
There are 70% to
90% of those people

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
who have an autoimmune
component to that condition.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:90%
That's autoimmune Hashimoto's.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now is
there a high chance

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that they'll have a
secondary autoimmune issue?

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.267 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: At least 40% chance.

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's huge.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.683 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:10:21.683 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So if your immune system
is attacking your thyroid,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:84%
there's at least
a 40% chance it's

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
attacking your brain,
your colon, your pancreas,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
your connective
tissue, your joints.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And those are known

>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And that is my
concern as the health care

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
Hashimoto's thyroid.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's if we don't get
control on this autoimmune,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
it's going to open
up Pandora's box.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:12.757 align:middle line:84%
So can this be started to
be solved through food?

00:11:12.757 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a start.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, food is
probably the one thing

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.527 align:middle line:84%
that we put into our bodies
multiple times per day.

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And nobody
really knows how to eat.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: We've
kind of all fallen

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:90%
for what the media has told us.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.895 align:middle line:84%
But we really don't
know how to eat.

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting..

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, we've all bought
into the low fat lies, that

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
eat low fat and that'll
keep you from getting fat.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we
drift towards carbohydrates,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
which are nonfat, like rice,
and corn, and potatoes.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
What that does is just
skyrockets the blood sugar,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
which will cause
inflammatory processes,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.135 align:middle line:84%
insulin resistance,
hormone imbalance.

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.395 align:middle line:84%
It just starts a whole
cascade of problems.

00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:58.353 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so people
that are also hypothyroid

00:11:58.353 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to look for
those fast burning carbs

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to get the energy from.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.166 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Energy
they need, right.

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.994 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But they're in turn
inflaming the immune system.

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Turning, just
lighting them on fire.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.203 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: The immune system is
very sensitive to inflammation.

00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And that inflammation
could come from foods.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:90%
It could come from infections.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.099 align:middle line:84%
It could come from
cortisol surges.

00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can come from
a whole number of areas.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.173 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look
at this other slide.

00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is very in
depth slide here,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but it shows the triggers of
the inflaming the immune system,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.809 align:middle line:84%
So there's how many triggers
have you identified here?

00:12:32.809 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So these are the
seven most common triggers.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are certainly
many, many more.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
most common seven,

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
which is anemia and blood sugar
instability, adrenal gland

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
dysfunction, hormone
imbalance, inflammation,

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
gastrointestinal problems,
and food sensitivities.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And you could easily add
on environmental toxins.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Genetically modified foods.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Genetically
modified foods, right.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Stresses.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So there's
a whole nother

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
list of things you could put on.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is if
you address these most

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.611 align:middle line:84%
common seven, you will get a
good jump on your condition.

00:13:07.611 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's break it
down a little bit.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's start off with the anemia.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
How would you know
that you're anemic?

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Would this be
through a blood test?

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Through a blood test.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And many people don't
know they're anemic.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:90%
They just know they're fatigued.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the most
common thing to think

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
is that you have an iron anemia.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But it could be an
iron deficiency but not

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:90%
an iron anemia.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It could also be a B12
anemia, or folic acid.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Or a B1.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh. and
is there inability

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
for people with
Hashimoto's or thyroiditis

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.707 align:middle line:90%
to absorb vitamin B?

00:13:40.707 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.956 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
autoimmune condition,

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
where they are autoimmune
to the intrinsic factor.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.397 align:middle line:84%
And so they can't
absorb the vitamin B.

00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.979 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So you could
be taking a vitamin

00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:53.685 align:middle line:84%
B that has intrinsic
factor in it.

00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you're creating
your own autoimmune attack

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.545 align:middle line:84%
against the very
vitamin you're taking.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My, god.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:90%
That's not fun.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm going through
this myself physically now.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So I am relating to the audience
in a way that most people,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
My body responds the same way
that you're talking about.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm discovering all of
this along with you.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:90%
So this is really super helpful.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking very, very
detailed questions here.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.775 align:middle line:84%
So anemia-- did you mention
what the ranges for TSH

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.636 align:middle line:90%
that you consider high?

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: What I use,
I use something--

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.911 align:middle line:90%
I use the range of 1.8 to 3.0.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That would be a
functional lab range for TSH.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:90%
1.8 to 3.0.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Anything above or below,
anything above that

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.747 align:middle line:90%
is going to be hypo.

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It's going
to be hypothyroid

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:90%
and below is hyperthyroid.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And then hyperthyroid,
we can also touch on,

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.419 align:middle line:84%
is when you feel
cold all the time.

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get your
body temperature up?

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It could be.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.835 align:middle line:90%
That could be hypothyroid, too.

00:14:52.835 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
out there with hypothyroid

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
saying I feel cold all the time.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.519 align:middle line:90%
And I can't get moving.

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
low blood pressure,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.101 align:middle line:90%
so they don't heal right.

00:15:00.101 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't have good circulation
to their hands and their toes.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's really difficult
to name a symptom

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.049 align:middle line:84%
and then call that
a disease process.

00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, interesting.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.524 align:middle line:84%
All right, now let's take
a look at the second one.

00:15:15.524 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:90%
It was unstable blood sugar.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So these are not
eating often enough,

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.261 align:middle line:84%
eating too much sugar
when you do eat.

00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Skipping a meal.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Skipping a meal is one of
the most notorious things

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So many people who have
hypothyroid have weight gain.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.252 align:middle line:84%
And so they feel
like if they eat,

00:15:33.252 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:90%
they're going to gain weight.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.316 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So their
answer is well,

00:15:36.316 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
skip this meal.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.241 align:middle line:84%
And then I won't
put the calories in.

00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And they won't gain weight.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The blood sugar
instability is probably

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
the number one physiological
stressor in the body.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.526 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is it one of the
main causes of weight gain?

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It is, yes.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's one
of the main causes.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not eating.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.988 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I mean,
if you just think

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.174 align:middle line:84%
of it from a logical
perspective, if you don't eat,

00:15:58.174 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
then your body's
not going to know

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.798 align:middle line:90%
when that next meal's coming.

00:16:00.798 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to say, I'm
not letting go of this fat.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when I'm
going to eat next.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But the best thing you can
do is eat very consistently

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
every two to three hours
so that your body knows

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
when to burn that sugar and when
it's going to expect it again.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Really stable blood sugar.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So every two to three
hours, eat consistently.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But you have to-- we're going to
talk about what kinds of foods

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:90%
to eat.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.796 align:middle line:84%
And that can actually-- we
could skip ahead to that,

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
to the food.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a specific
order, right?

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.771 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: No.

00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
food sensitivities.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you determine
what foods, I mean,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.447 align:middle line:84%
that a particular person is
going to get inflamed by?

00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: You don't.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, you don't know.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I do something called
a de-inflammatory diet.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I take
away all the possible foods

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.154 align:middle line:90%
that could inflame you.

00:16:51.154 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're foods
that you wouldn't even

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
think about, like nuts, and
beans, and rice, and corn,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and potatoes, and nightshades,
and yeast, and eggs, and dairy,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and gluten.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: People would think
that eating nuts, and seeds,

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.693 align:middle line:84%
and beans, and rice
is a healthy diet.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And in some cases, it is.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not saying that
everyone is sensitive to them.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, I've
been very surprised at people

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
who are sensitive
to eggs, people

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:84%
who are sensitive
to nuts, people

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
who are sensitive to rice.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
We would have never known this
unless we took 'em away first.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rice.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So you do individual testing for
people so that they can learn--

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and how many different
types of tests do you do?

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Oh, gosh.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We probably do at least
four to five basic tests.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That test for adrenal
gland dysfunction, and hormone

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
imbalance, and blood
sugar instability.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
We cover the basic triggers with
the initial tests that we do.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But then there are those very
difficult, complicated cases

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
where we to get into
carbohydrate metabolism

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and heavy metal poisonings.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a whole
nother level of complication.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But we start with
everybody with the foods.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do blood
tests, urine tests.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Saliva tests.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Saliva tests.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Stool tests.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stool.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So you go through every
function of the body to find out

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
what's-- so for example, the
urine tests are the best way

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.504 align:middle line:84%
to determine cortisol
levels, right?

00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Cortisol
levels, and even male

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.566 align:middle line:90%
and female hormone levels, too.

00:18:15.566 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So that'll bring us to the
adrenal part of the triggers.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you said
adrenal dysfunction,

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
how would you know that
the adrenals are shot?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
How would you know?

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: There would be no
way unless you got a test.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.358 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
is the urine test?

00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: A urine
test is one way.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: You could do
saliva test is another way.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
There's different
methods of doing it.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I personally feel like the
urine test is the most accurate.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And it tells you the
most information.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.394 align:middle line:84%
The saliva test
would be secondary.

00:18:43.394 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does the urine test
tell you about cortisol levels?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It'll tell you
how much you're making.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:84%
It'll tell you when
you're making them.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, it
tells you what are you doing

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:90%
with the cortisol you're making.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So cortisol's a
stress hormone, right?

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Cortisol
is a stress hormone.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it releases
when you're under stress.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.982 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what's its function?

00:19:03.982 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, your body
doesn't know the difference

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
between you missing a meal
or being chased by a lion.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Because you
have a cortisol surge.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're in a
fight with your spouse,

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or if you're stressed under
work, or if you're in traffic

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.639 align:middle line:84%
and you're late, you're
surging your cortisol.

00:19:19.639 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't know
that it's not a lion.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.221 align:middle line:84%
It just knows you're
surging your cortisol.

00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating
this stress situation,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
raises your cortisol, then it
starts looking for blood sugar

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.331 align:middle line:84%
to supply your body being
under higher metabolism.

00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:90%
To give it energy.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: To give
you energy, exactly.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.129 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so does that cortisol
eventually release in the body?

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Does it pool?

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.635 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause damage?

00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes, all those.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.516 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely
releases in the body.

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's great
about the urine test.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It tells you what are you
doing with the cortisol

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.484 align:middle line:90%
you're releasing?

00:19:51.484 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if it's detoxifying
properly in the body.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.546 align:middle line:84%
Or is it getting
caught up in the brain,

00:19:55.546 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
or is it being distributed
through the bloodstream.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
The saliva test, unfortunately,
tells you the quantity,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't tell
you what you're

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:90%
doing with that quantity.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So there are
different kinds of test

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you can use to determine
what's going on

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:90%
with those adrenal glands.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So now back to the
food part of it,

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
so once you've determined
what the cortisol's doing

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
in the body, we're going to
talk about some solutions here

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
on what foods you
can eat and how

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
do you get the cortisol wicked
out of the body, detoxified

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.919 align:middle line:84%
in the proper way, so it doesn't
affect the brain and the blood.

00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: OK.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big one.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah, that's a lot.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big one.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Did we get through the seven
triggers of-- of course,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
inflammation is caused,
hormone imbalance, and then

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.564 align:middle line:90%
the gastrointestinal.

00:20:40.564 --> 00:20:42.105 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That's a
big one in itself.

00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is?

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:84%
We should spend some
time on that one.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.673 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
stick with the triggers.

00:20:46.673 --> 00:20:48.299 align:middle line:90%
So gastrointestinal issues.

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: OK.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Gastrointestinal issues.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Many people confuse
common for normal.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.215 align:middle line:84%
In other words, oh, I
have the normal gas.

00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Or I have normal burping.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.086 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
gastrointestinal dysfunctions.

00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dysfunctions.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.793 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Your body's
not functioning right.

00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
If you've got burping, acid
reflux, bloating or swelling

If you have bowel movements
that don't occur every day.

00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have stools
that properly sink,

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
or are the proper

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
a gastrointestinal dysfunction.

>>KAJIKI: My biggest concern
about gastrointestinal

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have an

such as Hashimoto's or
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%

your GI track.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, so--

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: The majority.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you're
having acid reflux

00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and the acid alkaline
balance is off,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.084 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
continually be inflamed.

00:21:42.084 --> 00:21:44.083 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It's going to
continue to be inflamed.

00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It's going to let off these
inflammatory cytokines,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
inflames the immune system, the
immune system gets the message.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It attacks your thyroid.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It attacks your brain.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It attacks your colon.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so just
having an imbalance

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of good and bad bacteria,
like a dysbiosis,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
could fire off an
autoimmune attack.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all
autoimmune disease

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.075 align:middle line:90%
is based on inflammation.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: As one
of the triggers.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.385 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I mean,
that's only just one.

00:22:08.385 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It's also based on
hormone imbalances.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It's also based on
food sensitivities.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:90%
It's also based on infections.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I hope that people
are realizing, as I am,

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that this is not a one
thing fix all solution.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just take a
medication to fix this.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just do-- you have to
do like seven or eight things.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's doable.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.349 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
The body, unfortunately,
there's a domino effect.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So when one system goes bad,
it creates multiple body

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctions.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't work the
opposite way around.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GIL KAJIKI: Where you fix
the one and they all fix it.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
No, you've got to work on
all these other things, too.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it
also helps to know,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
for someone that understands
what it is that you're talking

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
about, because there's-- I
mean, many of the doctors that

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I've seen are into the
one step fix all solution.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Take the Synthroid.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
See me in six months in
order to get more Synthroid.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And, unfortunately--

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
that for years.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the specialist,
that's even more so true.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.261 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.611 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: The specialists
have a specialty.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%
They're focused.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They're very laser
focused on the one system,

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
even though they know all these
other body systems affected,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
they're focused on
that one system.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, people
will know that have

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:90%
been through this experience.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.468 align:middle line:90%
You take the Synthroid.

00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:90%
You call in six months.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:84%
You get another test read
to see that's working.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.627 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, you just up the
dosage to another six months,

00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%
see if it's working.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, you up the dosage.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.822 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's a hamster
wheel that's going uphill.

00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:34.405 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:23:34.405 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.408 align:middle line:84%
And that gets back to
our underdiagnosis.

00:23:36.408 --> 00:23:38.985 align:middle line:84%
If all they're looking at
is that TSH and that dosage,

00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to completely
miss the underlying condition

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.201 align:middle line:90%
of Hashimoto's.

00:23:42.201 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
autoimmune dysfunctions

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%
we talked about as well.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So then let's talk a little
bit about the-- well,

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
hormone imbalance

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:90%
and how that's related.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So take, for example,
if you go get

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the bioidenticals,
the hormone creams.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Could somebody with an
autoimmune dysfunction

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
seem like they're getting an
allergic reaction to something

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.665 align:middle line:84%
like that because it's
inflaming the system?

00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes, it could be.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.998 align:middle line:84%
I mean, inflammation is
definitely one of the things.

00:24:10.998 --> 00:24:13.845 align:middle line:84%
But it also could be
just strictly thyroid.

00:24:13.845 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just the thyroid
dysfunction in itself

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.847 align:middle line:84%
could give you hot flashes
and night sweats, which

00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:84%
makes you think you
have a hormone imbalance

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.647 align:middle line:90%
but it may not be.

00:24:21.647 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And so this is part
of the whole underdiagnosing

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.331 align:middle line:90%
condition is really what is it?

00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, most people
would think that's menopause.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.538 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes, exactly.

00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very often
mistaken for menopause.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.862 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So I get a lot
of people who say yeah,

00:24:35.862 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking the bioidenticals.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.302 align:middle line:90%
And I don't understand.

00:24:38.302 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:90%
I still have the hot flashes.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.759 align:middle line:90%
I still have the night sweats.

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm still burning up.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.489 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:24:43.489 --> 00:24:45.155 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I spoke to a
woman the other day

00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
who has been having for every
single hour of life for seven

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.475 align:middle line:90%
years has had a hot flash.

00:24:49.475 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: That's miserable.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it doesn't
have to be that way.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.117 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody has
a healthy thyroid,

00:24:55.117 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
they could go through menopause
without any of those symptoms,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Should be, as long as
their female and male hormones

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:90%
are in balance as well.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Now I could tell you
that one of the triggers that

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
throw off hormone the
most is blood sugar.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
So not eating enough.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.123 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Not eating enough
will cause an insulin surge.

00:25:15.123 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Or eating foods too high in
carbohydrates cause insulin

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.760 align:middle line:90%
surges.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Insulin surges then create an
overabundance of testosterone

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.379 align:middle line:90%
in your system.

00:25:23.379 --> 00:25:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, and that
throws off the whole--

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:25.836 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:25:25.836 --> 00:25:29.056 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you call PCOS,
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.

00:25:29.056 --> 00:25:30.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:25:30.055 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That's excess of
testosterone that is created.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that causes cysts.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.623 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It causes cysts.

00:25:35.623 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It causes unwanted facial hair.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Tender breasts.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the food now.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a chart here
that you've put together

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
about thyroid
dysfunction and some

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of the signs of the
metabolic dysfunction.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
We talked about some
of the testing here.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:90%
We went through this.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked about food
sensitivities enough here.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
gluten, first of all.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Many people have taken
gluten out of their diets

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:84%
only to find that they still
have the same symptoms,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
by eating the gluten free
breads, the gluten free pastas,

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:90%
the gluten free pizzas.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.434 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:11.434 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, first
up, the first thing I'll

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
ask them is, are you
sure you're gluten free.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Because some people think gluten
only exists in pasta and bread.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's in soy sauce.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.594 align:middle line:90%
It's in makeup.

00:26:23.594 --> 00:26:24.635 align:middle line:90%
It's an hair conditioner.

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's in shampoo.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's in cosmetics.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It's in beer.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.790 align:middle line:90%
It's in food colorings.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It disguised as
natural flavorings.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.715 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's in, I
think, rootbeer also.

00:26:36.715 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's in rootbeer.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.548 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rootbeer.

00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's in some wine.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.233 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So maybe your best
attempt at eating gluten free,

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
not eating bread and
pasta and cereal,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
you may be eating some of these
other items that contain gluten

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:90%
that you just don't realize it.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
problem, is maybe

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:90%
you're not really gluten free.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And if your body is in that
state of an inflamed state,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
then those things
like the shampoo,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and the conditioner,
and the makeup

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.397 align:middle line:84%
will cause your body to
go into the same reaction.

00:27:08.397 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Gluten to Hashimoto's
is like jet fuel on fire.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.967 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just lights.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It just
lights the fire.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.701 align:middle line:84%
It just makes everything worse,
makes the inflammation worse,

00:27:18.701 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:90%
makes the condition worse.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that that's
probably the number one

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
trigger, or do you
think that it's

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.134 align:middle line:84%
just dependent on the person
with the eggs, and the nuts,

00:27:27.134 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and all of the other things.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.383 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah, I don't
think it's the number one.

00:27:30.383 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
necessary trigger.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if somebody is diagnosed
with Hashimoto's or any kind

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune, they need
to be off gluten.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing good
about gluten for you.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like hands down.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing
is there's testing

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that we do by a
company called Cyrex.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
They have a test called gluten
cross reacting proteins.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And so for these are the people
who they say, I'm perfect.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat any of these
gluten containing foods.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
But they do eat rice
and corn and soy.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, gluten cross
reacting foods

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is these foods have the
same molecular structure.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:84%
The first three molecules
look the same as gluten.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And in some people's
bodies, they

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:84%
eat this corn and their
body thinks its gluten.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So it attacks the corn
as if it were gluten.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Creates an autoimmune attack.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
That immune system then
attacks that thyroid gland,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
even though you're gluten free.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about
these-- I mean, those

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.730 align:middle line:84%
are the three most
genetically modified crops

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
out there, wheat,
corn, soy, those three.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So do you think it's the
genetic modification?

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it's
the chicken or the egg?

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It is the
genetic modification.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to my knowledge, you
can't find any natural forms

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.085 align:middle line:90%

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been modified so
many different times,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.645 align:middle line:84%
your body doesn't
know the difference

00:28:53.645 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:90%
between that and a pencil.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over-- wow.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.287 align:middle line:84%

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And all around the world?

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.742 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: All around the

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:90%
less than others.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:84%
People can go to
Europe and eat wheat

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't get as much
of a reaction, or one at all.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So it's different in

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.707 align:middle line:90%

00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:39.035 align:middle line:90%
It's vegetable oil.

00:29:39.035 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vegetables.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:90%
What is canola oil?

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.822 align:middle line:90%
What's a canola?

00:29:43.822 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:90%
What is a canola?

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: There's

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.459 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And I just
learned this the other day.

00:29:49.459 --> 00:29:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's an offshoot of
different kinds of oils

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:90%
that they put together.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very rancid oil.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It burns very quickly.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a very,
very low burn rate on it.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's a synthetic oil.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Synthetic oil.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.205 align:middle line:90%

00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:08.145 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It's not

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a combination

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:84%

if you read the label,

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.954 align:middle line:90%
it's not just olive oil.

00:30:18.954 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's different things.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.495 align:middle line:90%
It could be safflower.

It could be all sorts
of different things.

00:30:23.377 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:90%

Can you-- so what
oil do you recommend?

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Olive oil's great.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:90%
Coconut oil is really good.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That also has a
low burn rate, though.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
What's that got to
do with the oil?

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Nothing as far
as the burn rate goes.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.716 align:middle line:84%
But it's got the good
fats in it that you want.

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
very-- it doesn't

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk a little
bit about that poor corn.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, corn is the only
thing that gluten free people

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:90%
could eat.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.341 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so bad in terms
of causing inflammation?

00:31:08.341 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well,
once again, it's a--

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's just wrong.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.731 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It's a gluten cross
reaching protein for one thing.

00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like gluten
in some people's bodies.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Which is just bad luck.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, it's
genetically modified, you know.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:90%

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.665 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not very
good at the agriculture,

your blood sugar,

00:31:46.575 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%

You can most likely go
to the stock exchange

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and see the most highly

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and bet that those are
genetically modified, right,

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's such a
high demand for them.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So even if
you grow the stuff

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in your backyard, the
seed that you bought,

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:84%
even if it says
organic, is most likely

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.936 align:middle line:84%
from some type of
genetically modified source.

00:32:08.936 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah,
the seed is going

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.209 align:middle line:84%
to be genetically
modified to some degree.

00:32:12.209 --> 00:32:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's going to be better
for you because you're not

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:84%
going to use the pesticides and
the sprays like other places

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:90%
would.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But once again, you

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:90%
going to flare up to it.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's a very
high glycemic vegetable.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.779 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess you need to
do your research.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe there's certain
corn farms in Idaho that have

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
specific non-genetically
modified if it's a family farm

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
that's been in generational--

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:36.996 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:32:36.996 --> 00:32:39.287 align:middle line:84%
And we don't take corn
away from people forever.

00:32:39.287 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we do is we go
through this de-inflammatory

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.411 align:middle line:90%
We fix the gut.

00:32:43.411 --> 00:32:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we start
reintroducing these foods back

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.626 align:middle line:90%
in one at a time.

00:32:46.626 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing is
when you reintroduce foods,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
if you get flared
up to that food,

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't fix
that gut, you don't

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.697 align:middle line:84%
know is that a gut reaction,
or is that food reaction.

00:32:54.697 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So you've got
to fix that gut first.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your
protocol basically lasts

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
for a certain period
of time, right?

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
How long before
people will start

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.432 align:middle line:84%

full period of time?

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's going to vary.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.543 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish I could
give you time period on it.

00:33:09.543 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But basically, the way it
works is we de-inflame the body

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
by we take away all
those inflammatory foods.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:90%
First.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.481 align:middle line:84%
We give them
de-inflammatory supplements,

00:33:19.481 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:84%
which I think we'll talk
about supplements, too.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.241 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So we
de-inflame that body.

00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Then we start searching
out that gut process

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's any kind
of infections or leaky gut

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Once I'm convinced that
leaky gut is fixed,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.005 align:middle line:84%
then we could start
reintroducing foods back in.

00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
that's two months.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.088 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
that's six months.

00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:40.610 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
that's five months.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It just varies from
person to person.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
What is leaky gut?

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.845 align:middle line:84%
That's such an overused
term at this point.

>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seems
really know what it is.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, yeah.

00:33:49.673 --> 00:33:53.145 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Your gut houses--
your gut digests all your food.

00:33:53.145 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And none of that
food is supposed

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.459 align:middle line:90%
to escape into that bloodstream.

00:33:56.459 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it goes through the
small intestine into the large

intestine and it's--

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Then it's processed by the body.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And then out comes your stools.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.447 align:middle line:84%
Well, these walls absorb
all the nutrients.

00:34:07.447 --> 00:34:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.905 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: These walls
have little cells,

00:34:09.905 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a picket fence.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that picket
fence is broken,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that has a direct link
down to the bloodstream.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can even eat something
as healthy as an organic carrot,

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.174 align:middle line:84%
and if that little particle
escapes through those cells

00:34:24.174 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
into that bloodstream,
the immune system

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:90%
sees that as an enemy.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not supposed to be there.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:84%
So it will attack
that organic carrot,

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
consequently causing
another autoimmune attack

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.090 align:middle line:84%
on your thyroid or
your joints, or your--

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.666 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the little picket
fence part that's missing would

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:90%
have been caused by--

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Inflammation,

>>KAJIKI: Acid, right.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.960 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: OK.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So does the
overproduction of acid,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
when somebody takes an
antacid for, say, heartburn,

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
does that actually
interrupt the process

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of the proper acids
going into the body

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:90%
to break down the food?

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: If somebody's taking
an antacid because they think

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.176 align:middle line:84%
they have an
overproduction, what they're

00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:84%
doing is they're
telling the body

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.589 align:middle line:84%
to shut down the
acid production.

00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:90%

00:35:17.426 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so really, most cases of

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.986 align:middle line:84%
they need more

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Right, the

as long as people take them.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the
food just gets undigested

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:84%

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Butter's fine.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me rephrase that.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Coconut butter is fine.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coconut butter?

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.513 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Coconut butter's fine.

00:36:50.513 --> 00:36:52.359 align:middle line:84%
I don't want regular
dairy butter,

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:90%
because that's a dairy product.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The dairy product will
tend to inflame people.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Gluten and dairy are the
two most notorious items

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:90%
for flaring people up.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked
about our friend dairy.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Why does that cause
so much inflammation?

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.061 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It's a gluten cross
reacting food, number one.

00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies weren't designed
to digest animal proteins

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
like that, animal dairy
products like that.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why is it
designed to digest

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:90%
the meat but not the dairy?

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.144 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: The body's designed--
the hydrochloric acids is

00:37:25.144 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:90%
what digests the food.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what breaks down food.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But you already have these
dairy proteins in your system.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And those aren't
good for everybody.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people, I can
have dairy, no problem.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not probably
the best thing for me.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So the body doesn't
produce the enzymes

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:90%
to break down the dairy?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.551 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It could.

00:37:42.551 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in some cases, they
call that lactose intolerance.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times people, they
don't have a lactose problem

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
as much as they have a
milk protein problem.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.265 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The casein.

00:37:52.265 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard of the
casein free, sugar free,

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:90%
gluten free diet.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
That's usually, it's very common
in the autistic community.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So casein is a milk
protein that the body

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.675 align:middle line:90%
doesn't digest very well.

00:38:03.675 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't
like milk very much.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:06.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:06.615 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we also haven't
talked very much about,

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:84%
sugar, and what that
does to the body.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Because-- but I'm into the
foods that you can eat.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But real quickly, tell
me what sugar does.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Well.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.445 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the sugar,
number one, is the sugar

00:38:22.445 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is energy for your
body to utilize.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it uses that.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat a fast burning
sugar like a carbohydrate,

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of corn,
or a potato, or rice,

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:90%
it's a very fast burning sugar.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:90%
So it surges your insulin.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is it's
got to get into the cell.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, if your body's
been constantly eating

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.630 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrate foods
and high sugar

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.492 align:middle line:84%
foods like corn, and
rice, and potatoes--

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
have to just be candy.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.866 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:38:50.866 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be candy,
you get insulin resistance,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:84%
which means now that cell
doesn't respond to the insulin

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:90%
like it should.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.526 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't open up to let
that blood sugar into the cell.

00:39:01.526 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's what
insulin resistance is.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.566 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: That's what it is.

00:39:04.566 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then when someone
is diabetic, what happens there?

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.675 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So then
what happens is

00:39:08.675 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
you have all this blood
sugar left in your system.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So that blood sugar gets
shuttled over to the liver

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes triglycerides,
cholesterol, and fat.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what's the liver's
function with thyroid?

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Are they very closely linked?

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Or does the liver have a
lot to do with thyroiditis?

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: One main
thing it has to do

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
is it converts the T4
hormone into T3 in the liver

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.174 align:middle line:90%
and the gut and other tissues.

00:39:34.174 --> 00:39:35.215 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's important.

00:39:35.215 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: But about
60% of that T4

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.670 align:middle line:84%
is converted into
T3 in the liver.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the Synthroid is
effectively T4, taking T4.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And then like if you were to do
any type of a glandular, that's

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:90%
the T3?

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Is that why most of
that is prescribed?

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That's why
it's prescribed, right.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does that
over-compensate

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.460 align:middle line:84%
for the liver doing its
natural function when

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.814 align:middle line:90%
you're taking those medications?

00:40:02.814 --> 00:40:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I don't know
if it over-compensates,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
but what it does is it
tricks the body into thinking

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's enough
T4 and enough T3

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in the system, when the
liver doesn't have anything

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:90%
to do with that now.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It's bypassing that step.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if it
untrains the liver

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.996 align:middle line:90%
to do what it's supposed to do.

00:40:21.996 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I'm sure
it could-- I'm

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:90%
sure it causes sluggish liver.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And your liver's responsible
for detoxifying your body.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So it will not allow these
excess female hormones

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to be processed
out of your body.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've got a
thyroid hormone problem.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:84%
And you have an estrogen
problem on top of that.

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Estrogen dominance
or lack of estrogen.

00:40:40.295 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So taking the medications
could cause the secondary issue

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that could very well
be the initial trigger.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:90%
This is very complicated.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- I mean,
it's making sense.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.025 align:middle line:90%
It's just, it's a wheel.

00:40:57.025 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
There's just a lot of
moving parts in this.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And very few doctors understand
all the moving parts.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because there's a lot.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.766 align:middle line:90%
Well, all right.

00:41:05.766 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about continually
fixing this with food.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So we talked about fats.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got coconut oils, olive
oils, avocados, and fish,

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.829 align:middle line:90%
fish oils, right?

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:17.328 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:17.328 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So those are the four,
and then certain butters

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.342 align:middle line:90%
like ghee, clarified butter.

00:41:20.342 --> 00:41:20.967 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Ghee.

00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Clarified butter's probably OK.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.229 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So those are
five different types

00:41:24.229 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
of fats that I've just
talked about, right.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.646 align:middle line:90%
Those are safe.

00:41:26.646 --> 00:41:27.686 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Those are safe.

00:41:27.686 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For most diets.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Do the fats actually
decrease inflammation?

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I believe they do have
an anti-inflammatory component

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.350 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's not really the
reason why we use them.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
We use them because
your body needs fats.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're really cutting
out a lot of the fats

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.931 align:middle line:84%
that you might have in
your diet typically.

00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So we really want you
to have those fats.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about supplements
like CLA, the lipoic acid.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And you see these supplements
on the shelves that talk about

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:84%
take this oil and it reduces
inflammation and takes fat out

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It may be true.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what you call
a single nutrient deficiency,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.311 align:middle line:90%
single supplement solution.

00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, OK.

00:42:13.518 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: My line of practice
is I look at the triggers.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I give my supplementation
out to fix the triggers.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel like I
look at the big picture

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and try to take care of the
small details along the way.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:25.737 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:25.737 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.695 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to keep
going back to the solutions.

00:42:28.695 --> 00:42:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's really very,
very simple solutions.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It's fats.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.824 align:middle line:84%
It's animal proteins, you
mentioned, and vegetables.

00:42:36.824 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And to simplify
it even more, it's

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:84%
eat foods that are not
likely to inflame your body.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, well--

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: That's really what is.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The right fats.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
The right animal proteins.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you're talking about
all animal proteins?

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: All animal
proteins are fine.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then vegetables.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: And vegetables, yeah.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
vegetables do you not eat?

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: We don't allow
you to eat potatoes.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't allow you
to eat nightshades.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nightshades, which are--

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.275 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Potatoes,
tomatoes, peppers.

00:43:06.275 --> 00:43:06.983 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eggplant.

00:43:06.983 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Eggplant, yeah.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these have a
certain toxin in them, right?

00:43:10.615 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: They do
have a certain toxin,

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:84%
but once again,
they typically, they

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:90%
will tend to flare people up.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.495 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's not everybody.

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So when we start reintroducing,
then it'll be fine for them.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are just specifically
people with thyroid issues,

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
those types of foods can
inflame the thyroid issue.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And we do
it for everybody else.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:84%
We do it for our
diabetic people.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
We do it for our
arthritic people.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:84%
We do it for people who
just want to lose weight.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:84%
We do it for-- I mean,
it's a good eating plan

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:90%
to have for anybody temporarily.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:90%
So we didn't talk about eggs.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.620 align:middle line:84%
You said your
body's OK with eggs.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:90%
But certain people--

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Some people are not.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.490 align:middle line:84%
That comes through
the tests, right?

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:50.865 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: It comes
through tests.

00:43:50.865 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Or it could come through
food reintroduction,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.930 align:middle line:90%
food provocation.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I've had three people
in history, my history, that

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:84%
swore they ate eggs up
until when they met me.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I took them away from eggs,
cleaned their gut out.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:90%
They reintroduced eggs.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.677 align:middle line:90%
And they got a reaction.

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you
don't get a reaction--

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have three
that have said that?

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah, and
so it's very few.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But to those three people,
they're glad they found out.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.366 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:16.366 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: So they either
have to not eat eggs

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.595 align:middle line:84%
or they're experimenting
now with duck

00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:22.600 align:middle line:90%
eggs or other types of eggs.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So when you're-- OK.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So the three things, the
fats, the animal proteins,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.780 align:middle line:90%
and the vegetables.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.086 align:middle line:90%
What about vegetarians?

00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Vegetarians
is a little bit tougher

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.165 align:middle line:84%
because most of their protein
comes from beans, and legumes,

00:44:39.165 --> 00:44:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and soybeans.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And those we don't allow that.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little tougher.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:90%
It can be done.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.007 align:middle line:84%
We supplement their protein with
pea protein or coconut protein.

00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they can
get away with hemp.

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hemp.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say hemp seeds.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.271 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: But they're
a little bit tougher.

00:44:55.271 --> 00:44:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Their choices are
lot more limited.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's not impossible.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not impossible.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You just have to just
pay more attention to it.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.093 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:45:01.093 --> 00:45:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Now supplements.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.556 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Supplements.

00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you mentioned some
anti-inflammatory supplements

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that are sure fire to get
rid of the inflammation.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.720 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Key ones are turmeric,
resveratrol, fish oils,

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.931 align:middle line:90%
and vitamin D.

00:45:17.931 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:19.899 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about turmeric.

00:45:19.899 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It's been around forever.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Capsule form,
pill form, food form.

00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Spices.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:90%
What kind of form?

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: You can't get
enough turmeric in your system

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to make a noticeable difference
in inflammation unless it's

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.586 align:middle line:90%
in a liquid form.

00:45:37.586 --> 00:45:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Liquid.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.184 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just
powder it on your fish.

00:45:40.184 --> 00:45:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.205 align:middle line:84%
You can do that, and
yes it's good for you,

00:45:43.205 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and no, it won't hurt.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can't take
enough to get enough

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.520 align:middle line:84%
of a physiological effect
to reduce that inflammation.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I use a liquid
form of turmeric,

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.990 align:middle line:84%
which is about
six times stronger

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:59.010 align:middle line:84%
than any kind of capsule
formula that you can take.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's OK take the capsules
maybe on an ongoing basis

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.240 align:middle line:84%
after you've squelched
that inflammation.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's difficult to get
enough turmeric in your system

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.307 align:middle line:90%
by just using capsules or foods.

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.262 align:middle line:84%
So a liquid form of turmeric and
a liquid form of resveratrol?

00:46:12.262 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Resveratrol, right.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.303 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:14.303 --> 00:46:15.597 align:middle line:90%
Now resveratrol is--

00:46:15.597 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: From the grapes.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From the grapes, right.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
those products out there.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Does it matter if it's
liquid or if it's powder or--

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.442 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Once again,
liquid ideally.

00:46:25.442 --> 00:46:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when you combine
it with the turmeric,

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.830 align:middle line:90%
has a very synergistic effect.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.656 align:middle line:84%
Is it red or is it, commonly,
is it the color of grapes?

00:46:35.656 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I would
say no, not commonly.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.017 align:middle line:90%
I mean, our liquid is white.

00:46:39.017 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: White?

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Believe it or not.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It comes from grapes.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It comes from grapes.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The middle
of the grapes.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:43.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.594 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And we
have other types

00:46:44.594 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of resveratrol--
capsules, powders,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.580 align:middle line:90%
which are white as well.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:55.064 align:middle line:84%
And then you mentioned
vitamin D. How much vitamin D?

00:46:55.064 --> 00:46:55.957 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Whoo.

00:46:55.957 --> 00:46:57.290 align:middle line:90%
It varies from person to person.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.395 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you
this by experience

00:47:00.395 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and what I've learned,
is that you can't just

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.240 align:middle line:84%
arbitrarily supplement
people with vitamin D.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Because even though we're all
pretty short on it, about 60%

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
of the population has
something called a vitamin D

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.407 align:middle line:90%
polymorphism.

00:47:13.407 --> 00:47:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Which means that
they can't process the vitamin

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.340 align:middle line:90%
D properly.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's another blood test
for that, called a vitamin

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:90%
D 125.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's the storage
form of vitamin D.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.071 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
usable form of vitamin D.

00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:28.069 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: And you
can't overdo one

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in search of raising the other.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.786 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you know?

00:47:34.786 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: You have
to have a doctor who

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:37.520 align:middle line:90%
understands the test.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.936 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
get the test done.

00:47:38.936 --> 00:47:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's a level for
the 125, and then there's

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.327 align:middle line:90%
a level for the 25.

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I have
to settle for somebody

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.434 align:middle line:84%
having a low vitamin D 25
because their 125 is maxed out.

00:47:51.434 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can't
just say to anyone,

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.875 align:middle line:84%
take 5,000 IUs of vitamin
D and you'll fine.

00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It depends
on the person.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Depends on the person.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes
so much sense.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one thing fixes all.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.187 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right,

00:48:02.187 --> 00:48:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the theme
of this whole show.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, vitamin D is very good.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good
for most people.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But people will take
some bits of advice

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and then do it forever.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.742 align:middle line:84%
And you just don't
know if, you know--

00:48:14.742 --> 00:48:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your
body changes, too.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Your body changes.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to chance
getting vitamin D toxicity.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.361 align:middle line:90%
And that's very possible.

00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So then you mentioned
fish oils as well.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And then can those be--
you can't get enough fish

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.385 align:middle line:90%
oils from the fish alone, right?

00:48:27.385 --> 00:48:28.385 align:middle line:90%
You need to take a supplement.

00:48:28.385 --> 00:48:29.265 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: You've got
to take a supplement.

00:48:29.265 --> 00:48:30.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that do?

00:48:30.605 --> 00:48:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, the fish oils
have so many great properties

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's de-inflammatory.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Helps your cholesterol.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.827 align:middle line:90%
Helps your brain function.

00:48:36.827 --> 00:48:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Helps your nerve function.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's almost
nothing bad about a fish oil

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.575 align:middle line:90%
that I can I think of.

00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Except there's
vegetarian fish oils, right?

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.636 align:middle line:84%

00:48:46.636 --> 00:48:48.677 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Well, they're
not vegetarian fish oils.

00:48:48.677 --> 00:48:52.110 align:middle line:84%

Well, I think that you can get
them from some of the beans

00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.680 align:middle line:90%

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.694 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:00.694 --> 00:49:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Depends on if your body is

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.570 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.171 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:04.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And then salt.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.534 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why salt is, or an
iodine, is good or not good

00:49:10.534 --> 00:49:11.700 align:middle line:90%
for people with thyroiditis.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that people
that have thyroid issues

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.170 align:middle line:90%
crave salt.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.397 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:19.355 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Honestly, I
hadn't heard that before.

00:49:19.355 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you haven't?

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:22.120 align:middle line:90%
That's been my experience.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Really?

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.249 align:middle line:90%
Is that they crave salt.

00:49:23.249 --> 00:49:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as my
take on salt goes,

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I always like to use some
kind of a sea salt, where

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.800 align:middle line:84%
you get the minerals
and the vitamins.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.420 align:middle line:84%
My position on iodine with
Hashimoto's is that iodine will

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.014 align:middle line:90%
flare up the Hashimoto's.

00:49:38.014 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:84%
There's enough
research out there.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:42.720 align:middle line:84%
There's enough evidence out
there to show that iodine will

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:90%
flare up the Hashimoto's.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.176 align:middle line:84%
And in Southern
California, we just

00:49:46.176 --> 00:49:47.425 align:middle line:90%
don't have an iodine shortage.

00:49:47.425 --> 00:49:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:49:48.025 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:84%

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.380 align:middle line:90%
parts of the Midwest.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
an iodine shortage

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.160 align:middle line:90%

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.359 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I think just because

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: There's

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.030 align:middle line:90%

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly salt water
fish that have the iodine.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because of the salt.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.948 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Yes,
because of the salt.

00:50:08.948 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And we get the seaweed products
that we have here, too.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you recommend
those, eating a lot of seaweed

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and what about cultured foods?

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.322 align:middle line:84%
Cultured vegetables, foods
that are fermented, probiotics.

00:50:20.322 --> 00:50:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Fermented food,
definitely fermented foods,

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:23.960 align:middle line:84%
right, to help
with the probiotics

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:84%

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.415 align:middle line:90%

00:50:27.415 --> 00:50:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever recommend
additional probiotics

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.730 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, like
little capsules?

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Always.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.010 align:middle line:90%

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Always.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But once again,
based on lab tests.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
certain strains

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:84%

over on or under on.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, aren't most of

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.834 align:middle line:90%

00:50:43.834 --> 00:50:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Um.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but ones that I get
don't contain any dairy.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.114 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:50:49.114 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:84%

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.171 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
naturally fermented

>>KAJIKI: My wife.

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:32.600 align:middle line:84%
My wife came down with an
illness about eight years ago.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could
get it figured out.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I started studying
functional medicine.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I figured out
she had Hashimoto's.

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I started talking
to other doctors that

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.720 align:middle line:90%
knew more about it than I did.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I learned, is
I learned how to manage her

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Hashimoto's.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And so to this day,
eight years later,

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:51.807 align:middle line:84%
she's hasn't been
on any medication.

00:51:51.807 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:84%

But the answer to yes, you're
right, You have Hashimoto's.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:90%
You're on medication forever.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:84%
That just wasn't
good enough for us.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And and so luckily,
we caught it early.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I knew people who
knew more than me.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you learned.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.061 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: And I learned, right.

00:52:19.061 --> 00:52:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And I did the testing.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And I did the protocols.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And I customized it for her.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now you wouldn't even
know she has Hashimoto's.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:84%
She's been relatively
asymptomatic

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:29.907 align:middle line:90%
for almost seven years.

00:52:29.907 --> 00:52:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.187 align:middle line:84%
Do most people look you up
because of the weight problem?

00:52:34.187 --> 00:52:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: I would say yes.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say weight problem is
a big issue, weight and hair

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.476 align:middle line:84%
loss are probably two of the
biggest issues that women face.

00:52:40.476 --> 00:52:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The cosmetic
reasons, but it gets you

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to the root causes
as to-- yeah, diets.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who has this
type of specific illness

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:53.460 align:middle line:84%
with Hashimoto's or thyroiditis
knows no diet works.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
No hair supplement works.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.845 align:middle line:90%
It's all temporary.

00:52:56.845 --> 00:52:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: You've got to
get to the root cause.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get to the root
cause unless you do testing.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:04.714 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Testing and also
the inflammatory triggers.

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right, yeah.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Eating
every three hours.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Keeping your blood sugar stable.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Finding out if you have
any anemias or absorptions.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Did we cover B, vitamin
B and B12 and six

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and folate and all of that?

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: A little bit.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
When people have a B12
problem, it's very often

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.190 align:middle line:84%
times because of this
intrinsic factor.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They have an autoimmune
attack on the intrinsic factor

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.560 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So which means
they probably have

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.270 align:middle line:84%
some kind autoimmune attack
going on in their stomach.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
absorbing this B12,

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.360 align:middle line:90%
even though they're taking it.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.193 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:53:37.193 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Or they're
causing an autoimmune attack

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.820 align:middle line:84%
with the type B12
that they're taking.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:43.430 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.245 align:middle line:90%
It gets so specific.

00:53:45.245 --> 00:53:45.995 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It does.

00:53:45.995 --> 00:53:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And B12 deficiency
could mask itself

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:84%
as an iron deficiency,
which could mask itself

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:52.645 align:middle line:90%
as chronic fatigue.

00:53:52.645 --> 00:53:54.365 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you just don't know.

00:53:54.365 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, we haven't
mentioned that- chronic fatigue.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So your organization is called
the Valley Thyroid Institute.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.984 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is it called
the Valley Thyroid

00:54:02.984 --> 00:54:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's located in the
San Fernando Valley, or?

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.842 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what why we called it.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But now we've
found a way to work

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.810 align:middle line:90%
with people all over the world.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we can Skype with
them or phone with them.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.069 align:middle line:84%
And we found very effective
ways to work with them

00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:18.360 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the world.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.244 align:middle line:84%
Have you found
out that there are

00:54:20.244 --> 00:54:22.850 align:middle line:84%
more people with this
illness worldwide?

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Or is it really is it
specific to the US?

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: It's all over.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:30.826 align:middle line:84%
And I would think it's more
underdiagnosed in other parts

00:54:30.826 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of the world, just because we
have more advanced medicine

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:38.500 align:middle line:84%
We easily get to the
kind of doctors we need.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the case
of the United States,

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:84%
it's better not to have
socialized medicine.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's interesting.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.127 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not one
thing fits all again.

00:54:48.127 --> 00:54:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:49.687 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing that--

00:54:49.687 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: I get calls
from people in Canada

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and people in London who
have socialized medicine.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And don't have
access to this specific--

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Right.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Testing and information.

00:54:58.755 --> 00:55:01.088 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: Exactly, because
if you don't fit their model,

00:55:01.088 --> 00:55:02.250 align:middle line:90%
you don't get the care.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:02.958 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:04.170 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't fit a model.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even really
fit it here in the US

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.590 align:middle line:90%
until you dig into it deeper.

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's at
the surface level.

00:55:11.297 --> 00:55:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yes.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why I think so
many people are underdiagnosed

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in terms of this.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So you do help people
all over the world.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.280 align:middle line:84%
You can help them
wherever they're from

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and just go through this
protocol with people.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've had the
most success with that.

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:25.981 align:middle line:84%
And actually reversed
many of the symptoms.

00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Do people actually get
off their medication?

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Some.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:29.291 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Some.

00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Some, yeah.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say a
sentence to medication

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.990 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's a
lifetime sentence.

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:38.245 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on if
you really need it.

00:55:38.245 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The earlier you catch
it, probably the better.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But you have to find out is
it really a thyroid problem?

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just multiple
triggers going on?

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many
people do you think

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that are on the medications
don't need to be,

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:53.190 align:middle line:84%
because didn't you say that
those people are not getting

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.350 align:middle line:84%
any better, even
though they keep

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.546 align:middle line:90%
increasing their medication?

00:55:55.546 --> 00:55:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAJIKI: Yeah.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say
at least 25% of them

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.730 align:middle line:84%
can at least get off their
medication or lower the dosage.

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAJIKI: That
would be my guess.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I've
learned so much.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.240 align:middle line:90%

>>KAJIKI: Thank you very much.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.010 align:middle line:84%
