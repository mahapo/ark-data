00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: According
to a recent article

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
in "Psychology Today," 50%
of marriages end in divorce.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And while no one wants
to go through this,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
there is a way to
consciously uncouple

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
from a long term relationship,
so all can live happily even

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Joining me is the author
of a national bestseller,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:10%
"Calling in 'The One,'" a
marriage and family therapist,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:10%
and the creator of the
conscious uncoupling process,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:10%
Katherine Woodward Thomas.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:10%
In order to break the family
pattern of a terrible divorce,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Catherine established a way for
people to consciously uncouple.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And she created the household
term, conscious uncoupling.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is now a number one "New
York Times" bestselling book.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KATHERINE THOMAS:
It's a joy to be here.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.287 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to have you here.

00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Thank you.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me a little
bit about your childhood.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
You started, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
from a very tumultuous
past, history.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, luckily, I
had a spiritual awakening

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.955 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 14, which I just
want to clarify for everybody.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean I'm enlightened.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I think people
get confused with that.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Spiritual awakening just
means that you're suddenly

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:10%
transported into a
different way of seeing life

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:10%
or a different way
of experiencing life.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And it opened up a portal.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It opens up a portal,
so that it repositions

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:90%
what your life is about.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So that happened to
me when I was 14.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 14.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you know that?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I mean, I
was already a youth at risk.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I was a troubled kid.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
My mom had me when
she was a teenager.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:90%
My parents had a nasty divorce.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
There were custody
fights, two of them.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.583 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: My mother was
married three times before I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
was 14 years old.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was just a lot
of change, turmoil.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't ready to be a
mother, so she was really

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
understandably so as a
teenager very rejecting,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
which of course,
as a young child,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
is completely confusing
and overwhelming.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So there were just
a lot of things

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that were unstable, and
unloving, and unkind.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was that kid who
would steal cigarettes

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.605 align:middle line:84%
from my mother's
purse at the age of 10

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.188 align:middle line:84%
and go smoke them
with all my friends.

00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I had multiple
lovers by the time I was 14.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I was clipping classes and
running across the street

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to the bar across the street
and getting drunk instead.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I was
really out of control.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the midst of
this, a friend of mine

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
invited me to her
house to do drugs,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:90%
which was very exciting to me.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And then at the last
minute, she got sick.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So I had nothing
to do that weekend.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And another friend invited
me to go to her little church

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
with her.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So I said yes because
I had nothing to do.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
So off we go.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Better than
going home, right?

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.747 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Better than just
staying at home, exactly.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So off I go, and I'm
in this Sunday school

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:90%
class for teenagers.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm way too
cool for the room.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the woman who
was in the Sunday school class

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And her name was Faith, aptly.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.347 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And she had
little buck teeth,

00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and she was just the
sweetest person ever.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.582 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying you have to
invite Jesus into your heart.

00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to invite
Jesus into your heart.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So I argued with
her the whole time.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.795 align:middle line:84%
But at the very
end of the class,

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
as she was going
around the room,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
she said, let's just all
say one line of a prayer

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:90%
to close ourselves out.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And unpremeditated by me, out of
my mouth for no reason at all,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I just said, Jesus,
please come into my heart.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I had never
heard of any kind

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
of supernatural
experience, but the moment

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I said that, it was
like a vortex of light

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
entered into the top of my head.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It was orange.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It was gold.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:90%
I can still see it to this day.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And it washed
through my body like a wave.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And it startled
me in that moment.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that moment
that I knew only two things.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
One was that I was
really loved by whatever

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%
it was that that was.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
that God probably

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.175 align:middle line:90%
didn't want me to do drugs.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.634 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Probably.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But that love you hadn't
felt before, right?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: No, I'd never
had that experience before.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never heard of
such a thing before.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this was one
of those very simple,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:90%
quiet Christian churches.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But see, and it
didn't fix my life.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But what it did is
it gave me this place

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
to go to to find grace.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I knew that on a very deep
level that I was loved by life.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to serve
that life force.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I had this desire to
know God and to do good.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was the kid in
high school where

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd sit in the girls' room
with a cigarette hanging out

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of one mouth and
a Bible and start

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
talking about-- reading Bible
verses to my friends to give

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.685 align:middle line:90%
them relationship advice.

00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:08.187 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:08.187 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is how you started.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That was the
beginning of my life.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I get this picture.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So you kept going back
to the Bible school.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, it was the
place where I found love.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I went back there.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my family was still--

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.695 align:middle line:90%
my stepdad had alcohol issues.

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was just a
bunch of stuff going on.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that was
your safe haven.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: So that was my home.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:90%
That was my safe place.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't quite sort
me out, but as I said,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
it gave me a hunger
that was moving me now

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to this day, I've
never done drugs because

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:90%
of that experience, right?

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She saved you.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.608 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, I
think for me, because I

00:05:43.608 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of
addictive personality.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time, I was doing
things that were troublesome.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:90%
So both were growing.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 18, I decided
not to go to college,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and I went off to
Bible school instead.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Long
Island Bible Institute.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you really dove in.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Which it
drove my family crazy.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So they were so upset, they
threw me out of the family.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%
That was their response to that.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:90%
They were distraught over that.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:90%
And off I went.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So I landed on my feet, and I
got this job cleaning someone's

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
house to live in the attic in
exchange for room and board.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I managed it, and I
went off to Bible school.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what kind of
family throws the child

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
out that goes to seek
Bible school, truth?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, my
family was-- well,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
this particular Bible
school was not prestigious.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And to give my mother
credit, I mean,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
she would have said,
go to Oral Roberts,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
like a prestigious
good Bible school.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So really, what
she was responding to

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is that I wasn't on
the track to become

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
who she wanted me to become.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of parents
have that transition problem.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I think if I look
back, she just wanted

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:90%
me to be a successful person.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:84%
She had an idea
about what that was.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And she had no relationship
to this experience

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that I was having, of falling
in love with this force

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and field of life
greater than me,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that I had this deep connection
with, that would talk to me

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and fill me with light and love.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't understand
that at the time.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense to her.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So off I go to Bible college.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And for about six months--

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and this is important
to the point

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with everybody
today-- so about six months,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I went in the chapel every day.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:90%
I prayed.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I read spiritual scripture
and spiritual books,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and I cried, begging God
to use my life for good.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a deep desire
to be of service.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is not only
was I a stranger in my family,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
but my best friend
turned against me

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and took all of our
friends with her.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
My boyfriend from
high school went off

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and married somebody else.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The eating disorder I
began at the age of 14

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
escalated, and I
gained 50 pounds.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So here I am living
in poverty, and I'm

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
in this body I don't recognize
and don't know how to navigate.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really alone.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
more than I could bear.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, at that age.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So I thought
that God had abandoned me.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I had this
idea, like, oh,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
if I'm praying to be
used by the light--

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You'll be saved.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I'll be elevated
to positions of leadership.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Good things will happen.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not always like that.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes that initiates
a dark night of the soul.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Initiation
is the word, yes.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And I went
down into the underworld

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:90%
for several years.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Years.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And I
stayed in addiction,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and I did reconcile
somewhat with my family

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
because I did end up
going back to college

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and went a route that
made more sense to them.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But I was very unhappy,
and I was very troubled.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
lot of abandonment

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that's happened up to this point
with your family, your friends,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:90%
God.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:84%
At this point, you
felt very alone.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I did.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a
saving grace along the way.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
So I was an artist.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I was a creative.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I was studying theater.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I love the theater.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, that's good.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.363 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So there were
gifts along the way.

00:09:21.363 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I loved literature.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I found solace in the classics.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And but it didn't
really all make sense

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to me, this time period,
until when I was about 25,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I decided I needed to get well.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing therapy
and 12 step programs.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
12 step programs--

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
because for all those years,
I didn't really talk to God.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You really gave up.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I felt
really let down.

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.363 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So you go to
the 12 step programs,

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:54.897 align:middle line:90%
you need to pray again.

00:09:54.897 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It said a lot about God.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.503 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It's all about
turning your will and your life

00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
over to God,
surrendering to God.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.585 align:middle line:84%
So I reconciled my
relationship to his spirit.

00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You found your way
back to the safe conversation.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I found my way back.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And immediately,
life is so forgiving.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
turn towards life,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
life turns towards
you in spades.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And all these people showed
up to help me on my journey--

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
healers, body workers, shamans,
Lifespring, Landmark education.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Like, it
was my full time job.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yes, and at the
time, I was a musician.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But I was really organized
around healing myself

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.932 align:middle line:84%
and completing some
of these old trials.

00:10:38.932 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I found myself in
that same thing,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Lifespring, and
really getting to--

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
those courses really helped
at a certain point in life

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and really catapulting you into,
what am I really doing here?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Asking the deep questions.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, they do, and
I'm still a lifelong learner.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I was just recently down
studying with Werner Earhart

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:90%
on being a leader.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.055 align:middle line:84%
He's teaching a
course in his 80s.

00:11:02.055 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: He's in his 80s now.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.478 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So we're
always learning.

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then you,
really, were saved by all

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:90%
these wonderful experiences.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But you also had to play
your own part in it.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And you were responsible
in wanting and seeking

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
this type of information.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I'll tell you, I
had a moment, particularly

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:90%
with compulsive over eating.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Food is a very hard
addiction to overcome

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
because when you're
a food addict,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
you can't just put it
down like cigarettes.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to eat at
least three times a day.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:90%
So it took a while.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
Overeaters Anonymous

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Program for about three years,
and I could not get it right.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.352 align:middle line:84%
I would just go off
the rails all the time.

00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was living
in Manhattan at the time,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and I was standing
on a street corner.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was having a
conversation with myself.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, Katherine,
you have to actually commit

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
to yourself in a way
that no one has ever

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
committed to you before, in
a way that your parents were

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:90%
never committed to you.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It's not
going to work unless you

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:90%
make that commitment.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized that in
that moment, I said, OK, I'm in.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I commit myself
fully, and I remember

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
the light turned
green, which I took

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:90%
as just this beautiful timing.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And my life changed
from that moment forward.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Then I could start to get well.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What a
powerful conversation.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to
commit to yourself

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
more than anyone has ever
committed to you in your life.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.485 align:middle line:90%
You've never seen it.

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
a model of it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:90%
You've never felt it.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to come up
with this deep feeling.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: You're the one.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You're the one who
has to do that.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of us stay in
all these healing modalities,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're not actually
having the breakthrough.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Because what we've done is we've
internalized the bad parenting

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:90%
that our parents gave us.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we treat ourselves
much the same way.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So if our parents
weren't focused on us,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
our parents didn't go
to the wall for us,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
our parents didn't take a
stand for our well-being,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't have that
within our personality.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.761 align:middle line:90%
We have to go to our soul.

00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:05.561 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We have to.

00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: We have
to go to our soul.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, mhm.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.845 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Because
every one of us

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
has a part of us
that is fiercely

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.192 align:middle line:84%
devoted to our
evolution, that's already

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
on board with that possible
future that we're looking into.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's why we came back.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:90%
That's why we came back.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, we all have
that purpose within us.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's such an
interesting example

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because your soul came
in with that deep message

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:90%
to really want to get it.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And it lost its way,
and then it found it.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's lost its way
again, and it found it.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And it lost its way again.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And this describes so
many people's lives.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But they give up
at the lost its way

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
part, which is understandable.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
dedicate you to yourself

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%
to pull yourself out of it.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yes, and I think
there's almost a flow,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:90%
a natural organic flow.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
At some point when
you're well enough,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
you begin giving back, that
it becomes not just about you

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
being committed to you, but
you being committed to others

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately you being
committed to the world.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how you then
got into becoming an author?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, yes.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it was
completely from the inside out.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So I did go back to school
when I was in my mid 30s

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to become a marriage
and family therapist.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was just really
to put a structure

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
around what it was that
I was already doing.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I did to give

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.022 align:middle line:84%
back-- so about 12 years into
this, and it did take 12 years.

00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to take
that long for people now

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
speeding everything up.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that when
we heal certain things,

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
we make it easier for
those coming after us.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But it took me 12
years to heal all this.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in my mid
30s, I felt so grateful.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't have the
relationship I wanted.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I still didn't have
a lot of money.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a singing career
that was very unfulfilling,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and I had to do all sorts
of stuff to support myself

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing that
I didn't like doing.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't
personally fulfilled.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But I laugh because I say,
but I was like now part

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.030 align:middle line:90%
of the worried well.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I was not neurotically.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I was just
normally neurotic.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.405 align:middle line:84%
I was normally unhappy, which
was actually a great level

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
up for me.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.685 align:middle line:90%
It was a big step up.

00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like most working
waitresses, right?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.992 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, or all of us
who are striving for things

00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
that we don't yet have.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're unhappy because
of the state of whatever.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:90%
But I had a life, was the point.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
When I was a compulsive over
eater and really out there,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I actually couldn't function.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for
me to hold a job.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.372 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a low bottom
compulsive over eater.

00:15:32.372 --> 00:15:34.205 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what I meant
by working waitress

00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is someone who has a
great job as a waitress

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.535 align:middle line:84%
and also wants to work
in entertainment like you

00:15:38.535 --> 00:15:39.335 align:middle line:90%
did as a singer.

00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're working
on yourself at the same time.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So but
out of gratitude, I

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
decided I wanted to do
something to give back to God.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So I said, thank
you for healing me.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: And I listened.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, I really listened, and the
answer didn't come right away.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So I prayed this every
day for six weeks

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
before the answer came.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me
when I was jogging

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
one day to go down
to Skid Row because I

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:90%
lived in LA at the time.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:90%
I still do.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But to go down to Skid
Row and to do an album

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
with people who are struggling
to get off of the streets.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.117 align:middle line:84%
Because we had a huge
homeless population back

00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
then, which we still
do unfortunately.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We do.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: And I was a musician.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:90%
So I had never made a CD.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how to do that.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But the moment I got
it, I was like, OK,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:90%
that sounds wonderful.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:90%
What do I do next?

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so one step in front of the
other, and a couple of months

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
later, I'm sitting
at the LA Mission

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
with 18 people who are in their
program, who had been sober

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for six months and were trying
to turn their life around.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running creative writing
workshops to get a body of work

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that we could then bring
professional songwriters in

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
to help them craft
that into songs.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm meeting with them
before the professional writers

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:90%
come in.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.289 align:middle line:84%
And week after week, and
what I'm noticing-- now I

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
have no training at this point.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.529 align:middle line:84%
I'm a wannabe singer songwriter
who's at the age of 35.

00:17:16.529 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
But I'm there out of love, and
I'm creating these exercises

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:90%
for them to do.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.637 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming
back week after week,

00:17:25.637 --> 00:17:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and their lives are
radically changing.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Like,
weeping, and liberated,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and having all sorts of amazing
healings with their family

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and with what's possible.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
And their lives are opening up.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that meeting that
I suddenly had an epiphany.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that going into
all of those years of darkness

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.570 align:middle line:90%
was not God abandoning me.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It was God answering my prayer.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deepening you, mm.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It was
actually giving me

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the transmission, the
understanding of how to heal

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:90%
your life from the inside out.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And just by
showing up in the streets

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
with these people and
listening, untrained, no skills,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:90%
didn't need it.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
You just listened
and worked with them

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.843 align:middle line:84%
in this beautiful, incredible--
and did you ever do the CD?

00:18:24.843 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, it came out.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.865 align:middle line:90%
It was out nationally.

00:18:26.865 --> 00:18:27.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:18:27.665 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: We had a concert
on the ABC in concert.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
We had Richie Havens, and Rita
Coolidge, and Brenda Russell,

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
like really wonderful artists.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Mavis Staples was on it.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a
wonderful project.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.578 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But it
convinced me like OK,

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.400 align:middle line:84%
to go back to graduate
school to become a therapist

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
and get credentialed there.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then out
of that came the books.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, as you see,
I'm a lifelong learner.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, I'm really
learning about metaphysics,

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm steeped in
consciousness and how

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:90%
we're creating our future.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm into the
ideas about things

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.168 align:middle line:84%
like living life from
the future backwards.

00:19:03.168 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm, your memory.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.835 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Right,
Michael Beckwith talks

00:19:05.835 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
about visioning your future
and then living into,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
not just hoping that that future
happens because we're sitting

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
on a meditation cushion, but
really being in this inquiry,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
how might I become the person
who would manifest that future,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
who could sustain that future,
this whole transformation

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
of who you are at the
level of identity.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's living into that future.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really steeped now in
these metaphysical principles

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
as I'm in graduate
school, as I'm

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
working with this population
of people who are homeless.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I decide at the
age of 41 that I

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:90%
would like to get married.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had actually wanted to
get married for many years.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:90%
But out of my childhood--

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
there was no model.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.577 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --you
could predictively

00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
see that I would have some
pretty bad relational habits.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I had been
struggling with even all

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
these wonderful
things happening.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd been struggling with
intimate relationships,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and I had a lot of
push pull dynamics.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of--

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.235 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Distrust.

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:06.818 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS:
--disappointments, mistrust,

00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
ways that I didn't
really value myself.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I had this pattern
where unavailable people would

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:90%
show up.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Just any form of
an impossible love

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
would find its way
somehow to my doorstep.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.258 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You would attract it.

00:20:22.258 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Like a magnet for a
married man, and engaged men,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and alcoholic men, gay men
who wanted to explore--

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
like, wherever it was just
never going to really work out.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And no available men
came into my life.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Or if they did, they
left very quickly.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you
couldn't handle it.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a-- yeah.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It was
actually confusing to me.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think of it is
because I couldn't handle it

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.615 align:middle line:84%
because I thought that
I was really ready.

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:50.415 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, how was
it confusing to you?

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Because you were not available?

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I didn't know
that I wasn't available.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:90%
See, we think we're one way.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
We think we want something.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.613 align:middle line:84%
And we assume we're
ready to receive it.

00:21:05.613 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
things that are going on.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have
something chronically,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
there's parts of us that are not
aligned with that future that

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
are actually getting something
out of the not having of that.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The behavior never lies.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: The behavior doesn't.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have to engage and
turn towards those parts

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, what's
the part of me that

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want a relationship?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
What are the agreements
that I had with people

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
long ago that would be blocking
love from coming into my life?

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
How am I still victimized
by relationships

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would have
me not really trust myself

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, that
I'm going to keep

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:90%
myself safe in a relationship?

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So all of this began
because when I was 41,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I decided to set an
intention to be engaged.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I called up a friend.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I was doing this group of
intention setting group.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I called my friend
from the group,

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and I said I'm going to set
a wild intention that I'm

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
going to be engaged
by my 42nd birthday.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And she said something that
really changed my life.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
She said, Katherine, I am
going to hold that intention

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
within for you if you
give me permission

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to hold you
accountable for being

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
the woman you would need to be
in order for that to happen.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, good friend.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: She repositioned
the whole thing for me.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I learned it
was really important to be

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:84%
much more interested in
finding my way to that future

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
than in sorting
through the past.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to look for
those parts of me that were

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:90%
inconsistent with that future.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But I did it inside
of the commitment

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.543 align:middle line:84%
to manifest a miracle
in my love life.

00:22:49.543 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had a
goal set for yourself,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
but you did the same thing
you did on the street corner

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
You recommitted to yourself.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I did, to my future
self, to my possible self,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.618 align:middle line:90%
and my possible life.

00:23:02.618 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's brilliant.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So then I started to
organize around that future.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that sent me
on my meditation question

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
every day at a whole new level.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would I
need to let go of?

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
What would I need to
cultivate to prepare myself?

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what
then eventually became

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
the calling in the one process.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Because several weeks
into this process,

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sitting there meditating,
and I'm taking actions.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not insight oriented.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.178 align:middle line:90%
It's action oriented.

00:23:30.178 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh, you have to be.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right?

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you get oh, I'm
holding this resentment,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and I still feel victimized,
I haven't taken responsibility

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:90%
for my part in what happened.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The moment I see my part,
I then pick up the phone

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and apologize to that
person for my part.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, you have to
put it into action.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You can't endlessly
write in your journal.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to live
your transformation

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:84%
on the court of your
relationships and in your life.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's accountability.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It is accountability.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's also this dynamic
co-creative partnership

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
with life to usher in
the future that you're

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.235 align:middle line:90%
committed to creating.

00:24:15.235 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's no joke.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have to commit to it,
fully be accountable for it,

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and explore.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you
accomplish this goal?

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to say, sometimes

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
people are afraid to set these
commitments because they're

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
afraid they're going
to be disappointed.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I always say, honey, you
have a PhD in disappointment.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:90%
You've got that one-handed.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll know how to
manage it if you do.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:90%
But you have to go for the gold.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Don't set a future that's just
going to be predictable if you

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:90%
keep doing what you're doing.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You want to create a future
that's going to really push on

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
you to transform who you are.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So several weeks into
this, I'm sitting

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:90%
on my meditation cushion.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I have this kind of download
that I should contact

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
this man I hadn't seen in
six years who I'd always

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
thought of as the one
that got away, named Mark.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the one
thing I did not do

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
because I was so shy about it.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought oh, I'm
sure he's married.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:90%
He was such a lovely man.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So he was one of the very
few available men in life,

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and I created some drama.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And I felt bad about the drama.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.957 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't do it.

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
created another story,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
thinking oh, he's
not available still.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, then I
created another story.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.193 align:middle line:84%
So I go to Agape, which is
Michael Beckwith's church.

00:25:33.193 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd been going
there for 10 years.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Had never seen Mark.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And there he is across
the parking lot.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I have a shy attack, and
I do not go to say hello.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And he leaves.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks after that,
I am complaining

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to another friend
who is supporting me

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
in this intention.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: He's not here yet.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
My birthday is just
a few months away.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
She says, you need to
get on the internet.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a while ago.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
This is back when I was 41.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So back then, nobody had their
pictures on the internet.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It was just starting.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It was one step up
from the personal ads

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in the paper, which was like
the horrible Lonely Hearts Club.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
So but I'm coachable.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So I went on, went
on to a site that had

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:90%
a quarter of a million people.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I ended up responding to
just one person completely

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.152 align:middle line:90%
anonymously with no photo.

00:26:23.152 --> 00:26:23.952 align:middle line:90%
And it was him.

00:26:23.952 --> 00:26:24.752 align:middle line:90%
It was Mark.

00:26:24.752 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.803 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: And we went out.

00:26:27.803 --> 00:26:30.393 align:middle line:84%
We were engaged just
a few months later,

00:26:30.393 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:90%
married the next year.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.893 align:middle line:84%
And then I gave birth
to our daughter.

00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
This is why you need
accountability partners

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Your tribe was awesome
in keeping you on track

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and reminding you, you
made this commitment.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:90%
What about this?

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a
beautiful thing.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:90%
These are friends.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're in an intentional
circle together,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's wonderful to keep
that, just to stay accountable,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:90%
just friends.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
committed time around it.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And it's more than
just oh, good luck with that,

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
like wishing us well.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:90%
It's like, Lisa, what happened?

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%
This is your intention.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I remember it really
well because it really

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:90%
touched my heart.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding it with you.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what we do.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.477 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and
that's what anyone can

00:27:16.477 --> 00:27:18.893 align:middle line:90%
do with any circle of friends.

00:27:18.893 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they can be from
random walks of life, too.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:90%
But it really helps.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:90%
So thus you called in the one.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I called
in the one, and I

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.998 align:middle line:84%
started living my magical
"Calling in 'The One'" life

00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
because I had never
written before.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a book
deal with Random House,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it went on the
national bestseller list.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:90%
And then I had my daughter.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I used the same techniques
to call in my daughter.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I got pregnant pretty
effortlessly at the age of 42.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: When I
bought my dream home,

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I had thousands of people start
to come to me as a teacher.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I was really living the happily
ever after life to the hilt.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10 years
in, my husband and I

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:90%
decided to get a divorce.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I feel like we should
hear the screech on the brakes

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.638 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, and
the crash of the car.

00:28:07.638 --> 00:28:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: A little
PR problem on my end.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.063 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:28:14.063 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
oh, there's a lot.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a really full question.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because I'm really
growing and learning.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was really
the right man for me.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%
But I really changed.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a--

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.257 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Growth person.

00:28:26.257 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: --change junkie.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- and we
just changed over time,

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.390 align:middle line:90%
and we grew apart.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And we started to see
that our philosophies were

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Our callings were
different and that

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
what we really cared about
together was our daughter.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we cared
about each other,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
but we realized that we
didn't need to be married

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to raise our daughter well.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we got kind of
interested in this question.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, is it possible to
raise a healthy child

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
with a happy childhood
if you divorce?

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would it look like
to have a happy post divorce

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.773 align:middle line:90%
family?

00:29:02.773 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, because there's--

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.605 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And we began to
see this-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --so many people that
are in that situation asking

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:90%
the same question.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, we began to see
this idea of divorce damages

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:84%
kids as very limited
in its perspective.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, is that
divorce does damage kids if you

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:90%
have warring parents.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.928 align:middle line:84%
Even if that's a Cold War, where
the parents are not aligned.

00:29:24.928 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, they feel it.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Where there's
somehow a break in the family,

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and they no longer are
being held in a family.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Because a family is a
container for children.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So we saw it then as a
profound lack of creativity,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that we hadn't figured out yet
how to keep your family intact,

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:84%
but end your marriage,
and set each other free

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
from the agreements that one
might have in a marriage,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and recreate the relationship
to be great co-parents together.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that means
that you and Mark had

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to be OK with your
relationship the way

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that it was as you
were uncoupling.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
You had to be OK
with the process.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.385 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: OK, well, it all
sounds very enlightened.

00:30:05.385 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can just hear
people saying, wow,

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.695 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was in that situation--

00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But my husband
is-- yeah, right.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But my
husband or my wife--

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.007 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My wife, yeah.

00:30:12.007 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Exactly.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So what I created out
of this experience

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
was this new teaching,
conscious uncoupling,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that inspired Gwyneth
Paltrow's conscious divorce.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that most
people are not really

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
live their ideals.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, we all would aspire
to a conscious breakup.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
We all want to have
an amicable ending.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:10%
But very few of us
can actually do it

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:10%
because of what's going on for
us on a lot of different levels

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:10%
when we break up.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Nature has not designed
us to come apart.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Nature has hard wired
us to stay connected.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go through
a breakup, most of us

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:84%
know that experience
of going from soulmate

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to soul hate, which is kind
of the organic process.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:84%
We go to a place
of anger and rage,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and we're very
obsessed with how we've

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
been wronged and disappointed.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.982 align:middle line:84%
But I see that as nature's trick
to keep us bonded with someone.

00:31:13.982 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, to be safe.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.357 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That
nature would rather

00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:21.490 align:middle line:84%
us have a negative bond than
actually just release the bond

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:25.388 align:middle line:84%
and recreate it to be much
less invested in each other.

00:31:25.388 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is counterintuitive.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It is
counterintuitive.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call it
conscious uncoupling.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to be
conscious of our biology

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and how we're hardwired,
which is beautiful.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Because look, 1,000 years
ago, if we wandered away

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:84%
from our tribe, we were
probably going to die.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And ostracized, yes.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And even now,
rejection looks in the brain

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:90%
like death, like threat.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:90%
It is a threat for life.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we're rejected,
we really do

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:90%
feel like we're going to die.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The survival kicks up.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That
somebody's killing us.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We go into fight, or
flight, or freeze.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:90%
We are on high alert.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The thinking part of
our brain diminishes.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So how can we live
aligned with our ethics

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to our emotions when
we're going through a breakup,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
particularly if we're the
person who's being left?

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the person
who is leaving

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
has had time to integrate
this and build an identity

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:90%
outside of the relationship.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And even if that person has
been warning the other person

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.898 align:middle line:84%
over and over, it's a shock
when someone leaves us.

00:32:38.898 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and it's
an abandonment issue.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you
process all of that?

00:32:43.637 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You're sure none of
that was coming up

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:84%
when you were going through this
conscious uncoupling with Mark

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:84%
where the abandonment or the
lack of availability, all

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I mean,
conscious uncoupling

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is what happened
with Mark and I.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's informed
by the thousands

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:90%
of people I've worked with now.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm
teaching "Calling

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in 'The One'" for years and
one of the things I see is

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:84%
the biggest obstacle to having
a great relationship is being

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
incomplete with a
former relationship.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to say your
next relationship does not

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.450 align:middle line:84%
begin when you meet
the next person.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Your next relationship
will begin with how

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:90%
you end with this person.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm, how you complete it.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: How you complete it.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.713 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good evolution.

00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: So I've been working.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I've been privileged enough
to work with tens of thousands

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of people in an intimate
way in my courses.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to
read their writing.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
So conscious uncoupling is not--

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mark and I, we didn't
have the kind of fiery dynamic

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that makes a relationship
incredibly challenging to part

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
in a conscious way.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of passion
in the relationship.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We always had kind of a
foundation of friendship.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to be
a bit easier than some

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
of the people I'm
working with now.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's what also
inspired, OK, I'm

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:84%
really going to really
break this down.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so most of us need these
kinds of action steps and ways

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to think about exactly
what we're going through

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:84%
in order to find our
way to that happy

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
even after future that conscious
uncoupling helps us to get to.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I wanted
to take a look here

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.144 align:middle line:84%
at this video where conscious
uncoupling has transformed

00:34:30.144 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:90%
into this household name.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: Conscious uncoupling
caused a media frenzy

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:10%
when it was first
introduced to the world

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:10%
by a beautiful actress
and her talented musician

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:10%
former husband.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:10%
To date, it has been featured
on the Today Show, the "New York

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:10%
Times," the "Wall
Street Journal," "Time"

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:10%
magazine, the "Washington Post,"
"People" magazine, the "London

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Times," and others.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
most breakups are

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
brutal, filled with
hostility and animosity,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
quickly going from
soulmate to soul hate.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.150 align:middle line:90%
But here's the good news.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
None of us want to break up in
these destructive toxic ways.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to hurt ourselves
any more than we're already

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:90%
hurting.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to hate the
people that we once loved.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly don't want
to do damage to our children.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't had any
alternatives until now.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Conscious uncoupling
provides the blueprint

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:10%
for how we can complete our
romantic unions in a way that

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:10%
leaves us happy,
whole, and free.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:84%
The conscious
uncoupling process was

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.385 align:middle line:90%
inspired by my own experience.

00:35:30.385 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Ours is not a broken family.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we call it
an expanded family,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
a family that's restructured
itself in a healthy way,

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
people much like the couple
that I worked with recently,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Kevin and Katie, who I helped
end their seven year marriage

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.670 align:middle line:84%
in a way that preserved
their friendship

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and protected the love
that initially brought them

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest breakthrough that
I had while going through this

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:84%
process was just finding out
that the things I was blaming

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
her for I really should
have been looking at myself.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Both of us learned so much
about who we are individually,

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and also we're able to take
our relationship to honestly

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:90%
a whole other level.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like
we are so good.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're
probably in one

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
of the best places
we've ever been,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:90%
going through this process.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It's time for us to
learn how to break up better.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That couple seemed
like that they were in a better

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:90%
relationship after this.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: So lovely.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but she fell in
love with another man,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.815 align:middle line:84%
so she ended the
marriage and is still

00:36:36.815 --> 00:36:38.523 align:middle line:84%
in that relationship
with this young man.

00:36:38.523 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But he in this process
realized that he

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
hadn't communicated
to her the way

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.262 align:middle line:84%
that she needed to
be communicated with.

00:36:47.262 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Do couples ever get back
together after this process?

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: They do.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:90%
They do actually.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But I'm
always careful to tell

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:84%
people, don't do conscious
uncoupling for that reason.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But you are uncoupling
from the former dynamic.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And if you
get back together,

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.632 align:middle line:84%
it's about recreating
a new dynamic.

00:37:03.632 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the first three
steps of conscious uncoupling

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.212 align:middle line:84%
are all about deep insight
into your own part of things.

00:37:10.212 --> 00:37:11.795 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your
responsibility in it all.

00:37:11.795 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And your
responsibility,

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and your patterns,
and your story,

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.693 align:middle line:84%
and how do you
evolve around that.

00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
first three steps

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
before you then go and
start to work things out

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:90%
with the other person.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very deep
internal journey.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, you
uncover a huge thing here

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.195 align:middle line:84%
about this divorce industry
being a $50 billion industry.

00:37:31.195 --> 00:37:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And you're really trying
to solve that, aren't you?

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, it's a dilemma.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm going to assume that
most people who get into family

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:90%
law do so from a good place.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But the system of
family law has a lot

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
of people making a lot
of money in a way that's

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:84%
a little predatory
on the big emotions

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:90%
that people are experiencing.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said, you're
in that fight or flight--

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
people do things like they
go through their children's

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.670 align:middle line:90%
college fund.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll spend
$30,000 to get 10,000

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:90%
back just to be right about it.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're kind of as human
beings hardwired for fairness.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And when bad things
happen that feel unfair,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
we just kind of go
a little haywire.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
the system, which

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
charges massive
amounts of money,

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and there are attorneys
charging $750 an hour,

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and those hours add up
when someone is upset,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
when someone is obsessing.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very easy
to go down that road,

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.463 align:middle line:84%
and the legal system
is set up for that.

00:38:33.463 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
give a shout out

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to the heroic legal
professionals who are saying,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
hey, guys, we might
be making less money,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.893 align:middle line:84%
but I bet this is
better for humanity.

00:38:44.893 --> 00:38:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the long
run, I think we'll

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
end up making just as
much or more because maybe

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
our reputation will get around,
and we can live with ourselves

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and be good examples
of what it is to be

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.055 align:middle line:90%
a human being to our children.

00:38:57.055 --> 00:38:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of people taking

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
stands for that in the
therapeutic community

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and also in the legal community.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:90%
But it is a big breakdown.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.308 align:middle line:84%
And there's a book
about it called

00:39:06.308 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
"Divorce Court" for anyone who
wants to explore that further.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is good.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So you're telling people
to go through this process.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.962 align:middle line:84%
And there's a five-step process
to living happily even after.

00:39:16.962 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you take us through that?

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, we start where we are.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So step 1, find
emotional freedom.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:middle line:90%
We're all a little haywire.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:84%
The studies also show that
someone undergoing a breakup

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:84%
has the same brain patterns
as someone who's undergoing

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:90%
the death of a loved one.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely traumatic.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We therapists call it a
rupture of attachment.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Our relationships
regulate us, so we're

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:84%
deregulated also
by the relation,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:90%
by not having the relationship.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.738 align:middle line:84%
That's that phenomenon of
the person who's hurting you

00:39:52.738 --> 00:39:54.530 align:middle line:84%
most, the moment they
call, your whole body

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
calms down when you
hear their name.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's this very
confusing time.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get a
handle on our big emotions

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
because every action
we take, every step we

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.443 align:middle line:84%
take in those moments are
going to be defining our lives

00:40:06.443 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and the lives of our
children if we have them,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:84%
moving forward for
decades to come.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:90%
So we want to do--

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I offer simple ways to kind
of de-escalate our emotions.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:90%
We want to have our feelings.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't want our
feelings to have us.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So just a simple thing like
what psychologists call

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:84%
affect labeling, where you
just stop, take a breath.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:30.080 align:middle line:84%
You say, Katherine, honey,
what are you feeling right now?

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's rage.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I can see how big that rage is.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:90%
What else are you feeling?

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It starts to put you
back in the driver's seat

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:84%
where you can make decisions
from rational mind.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So before you take action,
press the pause button,

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
calm yourself down.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I also to help
people in this step

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to transform those negative
emotions into the fuel

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:84%
for positive change,
setting intention, using

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
the energy of them to
say this shall never

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.707 align:middle line:90%
be so from this moment forward.

00:41:01.707 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:90%
This is how this is going to go.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Declare--

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --that this-- yes.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You
harness that energy.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.963 align:middle line:84%
Step 2 is about the
reclamation of your power.

00:41:10.963 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to have
to do with you seeing

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.680 align:middle line:84%
your part clearly, which is
not easy because usually,

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
other people have behaved in
ways that are hard to swallow,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:90%
that are deceptive.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:90%
They've not told the truth.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:90%
They've not been honorable.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say even if it's
97% the other person's fault,

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:90%
what's your 3%?

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And it might have
even been passive.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
You skipped over
your own knowing.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:84%
You were people pleasing
at your own expense.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You were minimizing
the red flags.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You were turning away
from your own truth.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have to see how you
yourself threw yourself

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:84%
under the bus in order to make
an amends to yourself moving

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
forward by promising
yourself you're

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:90%
never going to do this again.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
you're going to trust

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:90%
yourself to ever love again.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems like one of
the biggest pieces right there.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It is because
breakups are a crossroads.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And people will go on to live
a lesser life in the aftermath

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:90%
of a bad breakup.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.823 align:middle line:84%
I've met people 10, 20
years after the breakup--

00:42:08.823 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Never over it.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --who never really
had another relationship again.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is the step.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:84%
If you can find
the gold and then

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:84%
make that promise
to yourself, you

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:84%
will know you will never make
with the same mistake again.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You will indeed do
it differently--

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is really
good for couples

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:90%
while they're in a relationship.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.793 align:middle line:90%
This is great couples therapy.

00:42:28.793 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, sometimes
people read it when they're just

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:90%
thinking about a breakup.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And it will transform
their relationships.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I could think so.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, and the third step?

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Breaking the
pattern, healing your heart.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Most of us revert
back to a place

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that's very familiar when we
have a relationship that ends.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Sp you remember that
Gilbert O'Sullivan song

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.600 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s of-- dating
myself again a little bit--

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:90%
"Alone Again Naturally."

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: (SINGING)
Alone again naturally.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like that.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Like, we go back.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see, I'm alone.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see, I'm always abused.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
See, I can never trust love.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:90%
We go back to an old story.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So I, in step 3,
say, look, let this

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:90%
break your heart wide open.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
source fracture story,

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
the original time that
you had a broken heart,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and what you made that mean.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And let's actually
correct that at the core.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So because you've
been broken open,

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.018 align:middle line:84%
you have nowhere to
go but to do this.

00:43:28.018 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Most of the times, we're
walking around like, oh, yeah,

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.393 align:middle line:90%
I need to take care of it.

00:43:31.393 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm co-dependent and take
care of that little issue.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in a breakup
and your heart is broken,

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.940 align:middle line:84%
it's like God's got you
upside down and inside out.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.625 align:middle line:90%
Like, there is nowhere to go--

00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Twisted open, yeah.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --but to see what's
really true about that story

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and to finally push
back against the story.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Take a stand.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Start to see how you've been
perpetuating this story.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Give that up forever,
and graduate from it.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, wow.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.080 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does really help if you
have a guide, like a therapist,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to really help you
go through this.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It does help.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth step of
living happily even after?

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, this
is my favorite step.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Become a love alchemist.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to transform
the field between yourself

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and the other person.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's forgiveness
of yourself--

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --and
forgiveness of the other.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole
exercise about how

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to actually clear the
emotional residue in the field.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You know that tension
between people

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.600 align:middle line:84%
when there's been hurt feelings,
and there's never really

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.265 align:middle line:90%
been a clearing--

00:44:33.265 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you're
in a holiday,

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.208 align:middle line:90%
and there's a divorced family.

00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --and the
kids go back and forth.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And even you have conscious
parents, and they're like,

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Dad got a girlfriend.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
mm, that's nice.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's fooled
by that at all.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So how do you actually
clear the residue

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:84%
so that you're at peace,
there's a clear field?

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just say--

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --a tip for
that is that that's

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:90%
all has to do with amends.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Apologies are insufficient when
someone's really been hurt.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back
and say, how can I make

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.588 align:middle line:90%
this right, moving forward?

00:45:06.588 --> 00:45:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't ever
make it right with you,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.180 align:middle line:84%
just, I want you
to know I know it.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll never do that
again to anyone else.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.203 align:middle line:84%
But that's what begins to
repair the emotional damage

00:45:18.203 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and brings us to a
place where we really

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.315 align:middle line:84%
can all have Thanksgiving
together and have a great day.

00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what the
last step is, is create that?

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, creating
your happily ever after life.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's structures involved
in that and some legal advice

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that I give about how to
navigate this well with people

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.680 align:middle line:84%
who are conscious in
the legal profession.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But the big thing,
the big takeaway

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is consciously
renegotiating the agreements

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:90%
of your relationship.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that our happiness
level is directly related

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to our expectations,
and our expectations

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:84%
are all about the
agreements we've made,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.630 align:middle line:90%
whether they're overt or covert.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So just that agreement,
like this was my husband.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.320 align:middle line:84%
He's supposed to
always take care of me.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be the
most important person.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the rage that might
come up a year later when

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.060 align:middle line:84%
he finds a girlfriend--
that's because I never

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:13.080 align:middle line:84%
consciously made that
agreement into a new agreement.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Like, I set my husband free.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:84%
He is now no longer responsible
for my emotional well-being.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:84%
He is responsible
to co-parent well.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
He's taking that on.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.562 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
expectations of him can be.

00:46:25.562 --> 00:46:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So reconfigure
your expectations.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.558 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You reconfigure
your expectations

00:46:29.558 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
so that you can find a way to
be happy with each other moving

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.450 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This can really
apply to so many things.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It could apply to
a loss of a job

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and a bad boss or a
relationship that you

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
need to get out of because
of a bad work environment.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It could apply to a breakup
of even a political structure.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Or a business breakup.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Those business
partnerships are hard.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Losing a best friend is hard.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I've had people do it
with their best friends

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.690 align:middle line:90%
because they were heartbroken.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Their best friend won't
talk to them anymore.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I've had people do it who have
moved from one city to another

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.322 align:middle line:90%
to break up with the old city.

00:47:07.322 --> 00:47:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So it actually does translate
to a lot of different things.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Conscious uncoupling
in many different ways.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
pain in separation.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's tremendous pain.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the biggest
traumas we're ever

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:84%
going to go through, certainly
with an intimate relationship.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But loss is not something
that we're very good with.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, is that
with rapid change that we're

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
all inside of, we're all
living with a lot of loss.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.580 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how
to consciously complete

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.920 align:middle line:84%
those things we're leaving
behind in our lives.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we are changing
so fast that we don't really

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:90%
have the time to process.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And we leave these
disenfranchised pieces

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.310 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves along the way.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a wonderful
way to recollect,

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.080 align:middle line:84%
become accountable for where
you might have lost your way,

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and move into the future in
a much more conscious way.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you have community groups
around this and people

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that get to talk amongst
each other about this?

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, yeah.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, I train coaches.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of my time is
training conscious uncoupling

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.100 align:middle line:84%
coaches and "Calling
in 'The One'" coaches.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a very active
educational community.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I do a lot of
calls in the community.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the answer is yes,
and I have a lot of things.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a starter kit that's
free that people can just

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.868 align:middle line:90%
go to the website and download.

00:48:28.868 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, that's wonderful.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:10%
So you have an
opportunity for your--

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.130 align:middle line:10%
which I love.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.910 align:middle line:10%
It's not just you
centric, although you

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.890 align:middle line:10%
created this term and
conscious uncoupling process.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.473 align:middle line:84%
But you teach it to others, so
that they can then help others.

00:48:43.473 --> 00:48:46.057 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, they're out in
their community writing groups.

00:48:46.057 --> 00:48:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're partnering
with attorneys,

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.530 align:middle line:84%
or they're seeing
clients face-to-face.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, there's a whole
thriving community around it.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's incredible,
really, what you have created.

00:48:53.885 --> 00:48:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Thank you.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I must mention that
I mean, through all of this,

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.340 align:middle line:84%
through your story,
in the meantime,

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.070 align:middle line:84%
you had a massive
health challenge.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And this health challenge
came in the midst

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:84%
of you creating an amazing
vehicle process to solve

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.690 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the world's problems.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in the
middle of writing

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
the conscious uncoupling
book, actually,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.520 align:middle line:84%
when I was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: And yeah.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.810 align:middle line:90%
So but I'll tell you what.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:84%
When you have a cancer
diagnosis, anyone--

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, a lot of women
are getting breast cancer.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.903 align:middle line:90%
So it's more and more common.

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're sitting
here talking to me today.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Oh yeah, there's
so many great treatments.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:43.107 align:middle line:84%
But so what happened was when
you get a diagnosis of cancer,

00:49:43.107 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
there's a few days
because they'll call you,

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell
you you're positive.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:90%
You do have cancer.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But they don't tell you
the stage that you're in

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.738 align:middle line:84%
or any information about
what kind it is or anything.

00:49:53.738 --> 00:49:55.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to make an
appointment with your doctor.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.613 align:middle line:84%
So there's that two or
three days before you

00:49:57.613 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:84%
can get in to see your
doctor, where I liken it

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to what I would imagine
if you drive off a cliff,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and you're just kind of like--

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the air.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: --wow, I wonder
what's going to happen

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:90%
when we get to the bottom.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I'm going
to survive this.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes
into slow motion.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But I was so fortunate
because Spirit

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:84%
spoke to me in that moment
and said, don't worry.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to die from this.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And then what Spirit said
to me is you decided,

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
you set this up
before you incarnated.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's true
or not, who knows?

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.730 align:middle line:90%
But this is what I heard.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You set this up
before you incarnated

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.520 align:middle line:84%
as in a kind early
exit should you never

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.530 align:middle line:90%
become the woman you became.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Your life was so hard
how you set it up.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.232 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But because
you have chosen

00:50:48.232 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:84%
love so many thousands
of times, this

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to wash through
you, and you will remember it

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.590 align:middle line:90%
like a bad case of the hiccups.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:01.043 align:middle line:84%
So the gift of that was
I never wanted to fear.

00:51:01.043 --> 00:51:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did-- wow.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.607 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Or I never was afraid
during the whole experience.

00:51:06.607 --> 00:51:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just have to say,
that's an incredible example

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:90%
of guidance.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.970 align:middle line:84%
That is nothing you could have
ever come up with yourself.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: No, and
I've completely

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.670 align:middle line:90%
repositioned the experience.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So I went into this
space of deep surrender,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was in bliss most of
the time because everybody

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
loves on you.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Everybody takes care of you.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
anything to reciprocate.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I went into this awareness of
even the hundreds of thousands

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of people who've
marched to raise money

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:42.750 align:middle line:84%
for cancer research, breast
cancer awareness, who I will

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:47.440 align:middle line:84%
never know, but owe my life
to, because lo and behold,

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.320 align:middle line:84%
a miracle drug
came on the market

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.290 align:middle line:84%
just six months before
I was diagnosed.

00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just--

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.882 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For your
particular type of cancer.

00:51:54.882 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: For my
particular type of cancer.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.750 align:middle line:84%
My mother came and
took care of me

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:00.000 align:middle line:90%
when I was doing chemotherapy.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.812 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:52:00.812 --> 00:52:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And that was amazing
because she didn't take care

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:90%
of me when I was a little girl.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aw.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So it was very
healing for both with us.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It released her from some of
her guilt and her feeling bad

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.180 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It gave me kind of a somatic
course correct of having

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.570 align:middle line:84%
my mother take care of me
because anyone who's had chemo,

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.450 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of lying
on your bed for hours.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't even get up
and get a glass of water.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You've just lost 11
pounds in two days.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's pretty intense.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But then because of
that, I also decided,

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:34.080 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this was a
temporary journey, that I

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.545 align:middle line:84%
was just going to let this
open my heart to compassion

00:52:36.545 --> 00:52:38.670 align:middle line:84%
for people who had physical
illness because I never

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.780 align:middle line:90%
had that before.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So I really allowed that
experience to deepen me

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:90%
and my compassion for people.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I also allowed it to
reset my integrity.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.440 align:middle line:90%
That was the keyword for me.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's no longer
appropriate in my life?

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:59.640 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to
clean up in my life?

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.410 align:middle line:84%
What relationships
need to deepen?

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.270 align:middle line:90%
What relationships need to go?

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It repositioned everything.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it really
was an extraordinary gift.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I'm fine.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm cancer free.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.458 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
radiologist actually--

00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:13.750 align:middle line:90%
because I was writing the book.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.292 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't really write it
when I was in chemo because you

00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:17.410 align:middle line:90%
get that chemo brain.

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I tried.

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Believe me.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.250 align:middle line:90%
But it was a bunch of nonsense.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But when I came out of the
chemo after 4 and 1/2 months,

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I went back to work and
was writing on the book.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And the radiologist at
one point said to me,

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:32.160 align:middle line:84%
this cancer isn't really the
main event of your life, is it?

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, I'm
writing a book.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, [LAUGHTER] I never
got an identity around it.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
grace and the gift

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
stay out of fear.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I like sharing this story
because if the person who's

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.940 align:middle line:84%
hearing this, who needs to
hear this right now, maybe

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:84%
didn't get that road of Damascus
or burning bush experience,

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.290 align:middle line:90%
this is your burning bush.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.790 align:middle line:90%
This is me saying it to you now.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:00.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's awesome.

00:54:00.748 --> 00:54:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So just surrender
to this beautiful journey

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of being loved and cared for by
all of the people who are there

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.490 align:middle line:90%
giving that support to you.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great way to
look at it and to, as you said,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.370 align:middle line:84%
also go through the
process with a theme.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And your theme was to
transform, and you did.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:22.590 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely did.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So you transformed
so much that you then

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.720 align:middle line:84%
went into now the
dating world again.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have to ask you,
how do you suggest

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.940 align:middle line:90%
dating into your 50s, 60s, 70s?

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.665 align:middle line:90%
What do you suggest there?

00:54:36.665 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It is
really different.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, my friend
Joan Breger, who's a--

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.770 align:middle line:90%
or Bragger, excuse me.

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joan Bragger is one of my
"Calling in 'The One'" coaches,

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.010 align:middle line:90%
which is a great honor for me.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.820 align:middle line:84%
She's also a PhD from
Harvard University.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But she's really
interested in this

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.990 align:middle line:84%
because she has
done this in her 60s

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.105 align:middle line:84%
where she found her partner,
and he's a wonderful man.

00:54:58.105 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a lot
of my coaches have.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.007 align:middle line:84%
So she's been actually
studying the difference,

00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're thinking about
creating an article

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.290 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:06.207 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
she said to me recently

00:55:06.207 --> 00:55:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that I will pass on is she
said you have to really accept

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.850 align:middle line:90%
who this person has become.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You?

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
when you're dating.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.797 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Which is very
different than dating

00:55:20.797 --> 00:55:21.630 align:middle line:90%
when you're younger.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
possibility of who

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.780 align:middle line:84%
you could become,
who you might become,

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.670 align:middle line:90%
who one day will become.

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:34.300 align:middle line:84%
When you partner in your
60s, you're with someone

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:38.815 align:middle line:84%
and you're accepting who they
have already chosen to become.

00:55:38.815 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To be, yes.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.385 align:middle line:84%
And you, too-- who
you've chosen to be.

00:55:41.385 --> 00:55:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, and
reciprocate it as well.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have different
expectations because you

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:50.820 align:middle line:90%
have different obligations.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Very few of us reach our 60s
without people and things

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're obligated
to and committed to.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's about really
looking at kind

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of the automatic expectations
that we have from that happily

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.610 align:middle line:90%
ever after myth.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that myth
is 400 years old,

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was created when the
lifespan was less than 40.

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The new norm today
is serial monogamy.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
That's not me advocating
for spiritual monogamy.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:17.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just the statistics.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Most of us will have two or
three significant relationships

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.280 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And the expectations
need to change according

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.600 align:middle line:90%
to different times of life.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The happily ever
after myth was only

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.040 align:middle line:84%
about a young maiden
who was probably

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.655 align:middle line:84%
a virgin going into her
first ever relationship.

00:56:33.655 --> 00:56:35.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, and this was it.

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:35.925 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And so we're all going
to live happily ever after.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:39.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the hormones, yes.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So we have a lot more
wisdom and a lot more depth.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And we have--

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Living life--

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:45.258 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: --more commitments.

00:56:45.258 --> 00:56:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: At 70, I admire or
look up to these people that

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.520 align:middle line:90%
are married 60, 70 years.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Because my parents are
going into almost 60

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:90%
years of marriage.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And they've been through
so many undulations.

00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.290 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of work.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So going in and out
of relationships

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.520 align:middle line:90%
seems to be the norm.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, and also
years ago, I'll tell you.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I never forgot this
because I was destined

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to write conscious
uncoupling, and certain things

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.230 align:middle line:90%
stick in your mind.

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But I remember hearing
Thomas Moore once say,

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.588 align:middle line:84%
don't celebrate a
marriage of 50 years

00:57:16.588 --> 00:57:18.130 align:middle line:84%
until you know what
that marriage has

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:21.270 align:middle line:84%
done to the souls of
each of those people who

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.800 align:middle line:90%
are in that marriage.

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because
we tend to honor

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the value of relationships
according to the time

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.540 align:middle line:90%
that people have spent together.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure that
that's the only criteria

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:90%
we should be looking at.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It definitely
is up to the couple.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.330 align:middle line:90%
It's up to the individual.

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I think it's
about soul growth.

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.370 align:middle line:90%
It's about contribution.

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we can part
ways in love and learn

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to value the relationships that
we're leaving for the gifts

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that we've been given, the ways
that we've grown, the lessons

00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:00.340 align:middle line:84%
we've learned, then
we're going to be

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.053 align:middle line:84%
able to honor that relationship,
even though it's passing.

00:58:04.053 --> 00:58:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I have
to ask you, what

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.740 align:middle line:84%
is your biggest reason that
you do all that you do?

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.900 align:middle line:90%
What is your biggest why?

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Oh, I love that
you're asking this question.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I'm a
therapist, and we're

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.690 align:middle line:84%
trained to not
ask why questions.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK?

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.180 align:middle line:84%
No, so why questions, where
we all go very often-- like,

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:27.195 align:middle line:84%
why did you do that, are a
little shame-based sometimes,

00:58:27.195 --> 00:58:27.995 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:58:27.995 --> 00:58:28.795 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:58:28.795 --> 00:58:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So but I
love your question,

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.330 align:middle line:84%
because what comes to
me is well, why not?

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:40.150 align:middle line:10%
Why not take a stand for
the highest and the best

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.840 align:middle line:10%
that's possible for us
to become for ourselves

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.170 align:middle line:10%
and for the benefit of all
beings in this lifetime?

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:52.540 align:middle line:10%
Why not stop defining
ourselves according to our past

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.460 align:middle line:10%
and start to live into the
possible self of our future?

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Why not set intentions that
are huge, big, bold, that

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
are going to put us right on
the edge of her own evolution?

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And why not
take a stand for humanity,

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:17.020 align:middle line:84%
particularly at this point in
our current, tumultuous turning

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.425 align:middle line:84%
point, to take a stand
for the well-being of life

00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:21.550 align:middle line:90%
and for future generations?

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for teaching us

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.550 align:middle line:84%
about how to consciously
really be in relationship.

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:31.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've learned
from all of this,

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.650 align:middle line:90%
in or out of relationship.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Thank you.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I will consciously
take responsibility for it.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Thank you, Lisa.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing
this time with me.
