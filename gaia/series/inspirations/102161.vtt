00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.740 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting
from Denver, Colorado.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many rules
and laws that we go by in life.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
However, what about
the rules of life?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Who writes those?

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:84%
My guest today, Pam
Grout, has assembled

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:84%
a book of nine experiments
called "E Squared."

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:84%
There are nine do-it-yourself
energy experiments

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that prove your thoughts,
create your reality.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.774 align:middle line:84%
>>PAM GROUT: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me
about why you wrote

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.476 align:middle line:90%
the book in the first place.

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, I
think these principles

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that I try to
prove in the book--

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that I attempt for people to
prove-- are very important.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.396 align:middle line:84%
I think people really need
to know these principles.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that our lives
work better when we have

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.864 align:middle line:90%
these principles in our lives.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I wrote them as
a way for people to test it.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.529 align:middle line:90%
And it's also for the skeptic.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.229 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can talk about
these principles all you want.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
As somebody in the Bible says,
"faith without works is dead."

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way of-- yeah,
right, give it lip service

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
all you want, but you really
need to put it into practice.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.875 align:middle line:84%
And these experiments,
they're really simple.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:90%
They take about 48 hours.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So it gives people a
chance, because if you say,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.631 align:middle line:84%
will you commit to
a 10-week program?

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Most people go 10 weeks?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:90%
This is just 48 hours.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Just give it a try.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
See if, indeed, your thoughts
do create your reality,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.469 align:middle line:84%
if there really is an
effect on your life.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's just
a real quick and easy way

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to get people-- it's kind
of like double-dog dare you.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Double-dog dare you.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were there thoughts
that were not being real?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Or were you having a
challenging time in your life?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:84%
Why write a book about
why your thoughts create--

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
or proving why your thoughts
create your reality.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Because I think
people need to know this.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It's for the skeptic.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It's for the people
that have believed

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:90%
it but weren't totally sure.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's also for people that
have, oh, yeah, right Pam.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way to
get people to realize,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.208 align:middle line:84%
because we need to know
about these principles.

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Because these experiments
all prove principles

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
that are very
important, like the fact

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.259 align:middle line:90%
that the universe has your back.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
People need to know that.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.925 align:middle line:84%
They need to know that there is
this benevolent force that they

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.849 align:middle line:84%
can connect with that
wants to guide them.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very important
that people know that.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.056 align:middle line:84%
Their lives will just work
better if they know that.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:18.262 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you can say that,
but here's a way to prove that.

00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you first
discover that for yourself?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.247 align:middle line:90%
Was life not working for you?

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:22.746 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: No.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.236 align:middle line:84%
I mean life's always
pretty much worked for me.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I've known about these
principles a lot in my life.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had challenges,
just like everybody else.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.912 align:middle line:84%
But I began studying
these principles,

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, ages ago.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen them.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows this idea that
you think about something,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.394 align:middle line:84%
and then you see evidence of
it recreating in your life.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a principle that
we all have this inkling about,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
but we're not exactly
sure how it works.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
everyone knows about it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in the personal
development world,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.422 align:middle line:84%
but do people really know
about it outside of this world?

00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Maybe not everybody.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.171 align:middle line:84%
But now it's starting to become
a little bit more mainstream.

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I think more people
are aware of that.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.487 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask people, even
those that are practicing it,

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
everybody has a little bit
more of awareness of it

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
than they pretend
to, oftentimes.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.319 align:middle line:84%
And they use it in different
ways in their life.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.775 align:middle line:90%
Or they call it a synchronicity.

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Or that was just a coincidence.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence is a big thing.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.335 align:middle line:84%
But those are when things
usually really work out.

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.711 align:middle line:84%
Well, this force is always
trying to get through to us,

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:19.629 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This force.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.212 align:middle line:90%
What is this force?

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:23.461 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: I call it the field
of infinite potentiality.

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
It has many, many names.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.938 align:middle line:84%
One of the names I've been
using lately is the divine buzz.

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
There's this energy force
that is so powerful.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're all connected to it.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And we should use it.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's been called
God over the years.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's one
of things I talked

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
about a lot in "E Squared" is
that because it was called God,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of baggage
around that word.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
would run away.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I don't want to
have anything to do with that.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.728 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really matter
what you call this force.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't care.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is there to
be used all the time.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So like in the
quantum world, there

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
are infinite potentialities--
infinite ways

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:90%
something could happen.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:90%
There is no absolute reality.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So how we affect and
play with this field

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is according to our
beliefs and expectations.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So we draw from this big field
of literally infinite ways

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:90%
that things could pan out.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We draw from this just our
little tiny little bit of it--

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:84%
expectations and
information that we have,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
or these beliefs, these
opinions that we've

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
been taught-- these mental
constructs that we've

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:90%
been taught.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:90%
So basically, that's what it is.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just this big
field of infinite,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
teeming energy of just
anything could happen.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It's really exciting.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It's magical.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's miraculous.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
need to know about it.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you know,
you've been a travel

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.046 align:middle line:90%
writer for a long time.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
What was your experience
like switching

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:90%
from writing about travel--

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: I still
write about travel.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But also
writing about energy.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: You know, energy
affects every person.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.654 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like energy
workers or, I don't know--

00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Shamans.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.944 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody uses
energy, but not everybody's

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:90%
aware of it.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an invisible force,
so a lot of people

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
don't exactly trust
it or believe in it.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
But we all use it all the time.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.414 align:middle line:90%
You can't not use it.

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You're always sending out--
you're like this magnet,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're sending out your
vibration, your thoughts out

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
into the world, and then
drawing it back to you.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like exact
vibrational matches.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.402 align:middle line:90%
So people constantly use it.

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:90%
They just aren't aware of it.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.026 align:middle line:84%
And so what this
book does is help

00:05:20.026 --> 00:05:21.697 align:middle line:84%
people use it in a
more conscious way,

00:05:21.697 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
in a more intentional way.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Practical
way-- very practical.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: And also
practical, yeah.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.041 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep.

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.748 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some of
the philosophies that you

00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
have in the book
about "the world

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:90%
is abundant and unlimited."

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:90%
I love that concept.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.394 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is who
you're being, right?

00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: This is the
truth of the world.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.915 align:middle line:90%
If you look at nature--

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:39.998 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not just Pam.

00:05:39.998 --> 00:05:40.724 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: No.

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
The world is abundant.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, anybody that doesn't
see the abundance of the world

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:90%
has got blinders on.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the mental
constructs that I talked about

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:90%
in "E Cubed."

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.016 align:middle line:84%
But if you go out and look
at a square foot of grass,

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
you can't even count all
the blades of grass there.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Think about all the
leaves on a tree.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
abundance in nature.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
We have tried to
block it off again,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.426 align:middle line:84%
with these mental
constructs, but it's not

00:06:02.426 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:90%
the truth of the way it is.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:90%
So there is a natural abundance.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And once you start being
aware of the natural abundance

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of the world, it will come to
you in a lot of other ways.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
We have so much baggage
around abundance.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
We think it all has to
do with money and things

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:84%
like that, which is
completely-- money

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is just a representation of
your beliefs and expectations.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not even real.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Money is not even real.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.117 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a reflection
of how you see it

00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:90%
and how you believe in it.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.181 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: We've
created these systems,

00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.127 align:middle line:84%
that this is how we think
money is, but it's not real.

00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:33.335 align:middle line:90%
It's just a man-made concept.

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:35.376 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk
about that for a second.

00:06:35.376 --> 00:06:37.685 align:middle line:84%
So money is a reflection
of who you are?

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: It's a result of your
beliefs and expectations--

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:90%
how it shows up in your world.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Energetically.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Energetically, yes.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
I did an article.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I write a lot for
"People" magazine.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.793 align:middle line:90%
And I once did an article.

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
They love stories
about millionaires

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.834 align:middle line:90%
who give their money away.

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So I did a story
about this woman.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Her grandfather had invented
the dial telephone or something.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:90%
So she had millions.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.906 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't feel right when
other people didn't, so she

00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:00.239 align:middle line:90%
gave all her money away.

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But she grew up in that
prosperity consciousness.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, she grew up
in a very wealthy family.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:90%
She gave all her money away.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Started a little business
to kind of help people

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:90%
raise money for charity.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
She really wants
to do good works.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.331 align:middle line:84%
Before long, she
had another million.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
her consciousness.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
to you however

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
you're used to seeing it.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.151 align:middle line:84%
Same with if you're used
to seeing it as limited,

00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's not
enough, you're going

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to create that in your life.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.402 align:middle line:84%
So it really is
just a reflection.

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all man-made concepts,
the concept of money,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's a reflection of how
we choose to interact with it.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the
book is all about

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.325 align:middle line:84%
how you can take that-- if
you were to raised with,

00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe, a scarcity complex--
that you can actually

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
change that, based on the
evidence from your book,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.625 align:middle line:90%
that energy is real.

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.166 align:middle line:84%
I have little experiments
that people can try.

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Like the one about money
is in that "E Cubed."

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second book
that has experiments.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.089 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
money experiment?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, there's
a couple different ones.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
One of them is to
actually seed money.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So you actually put
money out there.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Like my daughter and I, for
example, went to Chicago.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And we took little
$5 bills, and we'd

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
stick them in along Miracle
Mile, like on hangers

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:90%
on Miracle Mile.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.144 align:middle line:84%
Or just on park
benches, or whatever.

00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:90%
The world is abundant.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:90%
So we just kind of seeded money.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.202 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
outgive the universe.

00:08:16.202 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so then see if any
money comes back to you.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, my book went
onto the "New York Times"

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Best-Seller list at that time.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So it certainly worked for me.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.108 align:middle line:90%
But that's one of them.

00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Another one is just to
start looking for pennies.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And to realize, again,
it's just energy.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So you celebrate
every penny you find.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, wow,
there's pennies everywhere.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're just abundant.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the quantum world,
any tiny little thing

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that's close to the big thing--
I mean, it's all the same.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a holograph
of the big thing.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So you just start
celebrating all the money,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
if you want to talk
about just money.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, abundance is
a lot more than just money.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But that's what a
lot of people tend

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to think of when they
talk about abundance.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you give the
example of a piece of grass,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
think about all the blades, all
the soil, all of the insects.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.696 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is an abundant
little square foot of grass.

00:09:02.696 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a lot
of abundance there.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: It's so amazing.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And once you start really
looking at even this moment,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:90%
how much is right here.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
There's so much energy.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.364 align:middle line:84%
It's just teeming
with possibility.

00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just so exciting.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once you start
looking for abundance,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.751 align:middle line:90%
that's all you see.

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's how you
can shift your energy.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.625 align:middle line:84%
And then those things
about leaving the money

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and seeding the
money, or the pennies,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.505 align:middle line:84%
it's just a manifestation
of the energy.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.546 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you start to
create it over and over again

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
by those little
practices that seem

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
like they don't mean anything,
but it's the cumulative effect

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
of them, right?

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.626 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: It's not
even cumulative.

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
It's hooking into that
particular resonant field.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
The resonant field
of giving away money

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:90%
is there's abundance.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.159 align:middle line:84%
I can give away everything
and it will come back to me.

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So then you're hooking into
a different resonant field.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like a radio station
or television station.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
There's certain waves
that create that one.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So you want to hook
into this other wave,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.684 align:middle line:84%
this other station, this other
resonant field of abundance.

00:09:54.684 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then you say,
the more that I give,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.462 align:middle line:90%
the more I receive.

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Exactly.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that's
something that's,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.439 align:middle line:90%
oh, you don't give to receive.

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And there's a--

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.868 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: You don't do
it for that reason.

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.711 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
you end up finding.

00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.586 align:middle line:84%
You do it because you
love it and because you

00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
know the universe
has more than enough.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is our natural state--
to be joyful, to be giving.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:90%
We feel good when we give.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:90%
We want to give.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.752 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to accumulate a
bunch of crap, to be honest.

00:10:16.752 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't need all this stuff.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make us happy.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Giving-- it's a
natural circulation.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a flow that continues.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job
to keep it flowing.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So in the book-- the
first book, "E Squared"--

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
you have these great experiments
that kind of just show how

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
energy shows up in the world.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The first one we could talk
about is the The Dude Abides.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.137 align:middle line:90%
What is that one?

00:10:40.137 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: I called it that.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
All the titles of the
experiments are kind of funny.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the principles are
very serious-- not serious,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.977 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very accurate truth.

00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But I can named them
all funny things,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.018 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like anything
that's going to be sustainable

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:52.686 align:middle line:90%
has to be fun.

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything you want to continue,
you've got to make it fun.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, anyway, The
Dude Abides, of course,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
is a take off on Jeff Bridges'
movie, "The Big Lebowski."

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
He talks about,
"The Dude abides."

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So The Dude could be called God.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just the fact that there
is this force out there.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, the name doesn't matter,
but I just called it that.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do
is I tell people,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.453 align:middle line:90%
it's throwing down the gauntlet.

00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:12.892 align:middle line:84%
You've got 48 hours to
say, you know what, Dude?

00:11:12.892 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:90%
You know what, big guy?

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're really out
there, I want a sign.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And just ask for a sign.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%
The stories I hear are amazing.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every day I get
emails from people saying,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.417 align:middle line:84%
you are never going
to believe this.

00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell me about
their miracle stories.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.825 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believed
in these principles.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I've used them in
my own life forever.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.834 align:middle line:84%
But to get all this
concrete evidence--

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you get
to see them show up.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: --every day,
constantly, it's so exciting.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really
strengthened my belief

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:90%
in these principles.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew
they worked for me.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.767 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, if it's
indeed a true principle,

00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to
work for everybody.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.417 align:middle line:90%
It is reproducible.

00:11:51.417 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, with
these experiments,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
it has been
reproducible for others.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.105 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
this force just is

00:11:57.105 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
dying to-- that's a
bad choice of words--

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is really eager to
connect with all of us.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It really wants to.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
It loves us.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.554 align:middle line:84%
I always think of
at a rodeo, there's

00:12:06.554 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that little fence,
when they open it up,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and the bull comes
charging out of the fence.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like that is that force.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just right there.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is lift that
door, and it comes charging in.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.177 align:middle line:84%
And that's how eager it
is to interact with us.

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way
of looking at it.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give--
so another example.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:90%
The Alby Einstein Principle.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:90%
You, too, are a field of energy.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: All of us are energy.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.644 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as matter.

00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you really
break down matter,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:90%
it's 99.9% space, basically.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And so we are energy.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why our thoughts
go out and interact

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
with this big energy field
that we're all part of.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everything.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I call it the
Alby Einstein Principle

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
because he's the first that
kind of suggested that maybe we

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:90%
are energy and not matter.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.829 align:middle line:84%
And so on that
one, I have people

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:57.870 align:middle line:84%
make these little wands
that are easy to make out

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:90%
of hangers in the closet.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have a few here.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yes.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have a couple of them

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.478 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You brought with you.

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Have wands, will travel.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yes, exactly.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you want to try, too?

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Sure.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Show me how to do this.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Sure.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:90%
You can do this at home.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yes.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Coat hanger.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.718 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Although I
have since discovered

00:13:11.718 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that in the Norwegian
countries, they

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
don't have metal hangers,
because many of my readers

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
have written to me and say,
we don't have metal hangers.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But you can use any
metal whatsoever.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you hold
them out in front of you.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll notice, they
are kind of waving around,

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.187 align:middle line:90%
which this is your energy.

00:13:27.187 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these are
straws that are over--

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're not actually
holding the metal.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.649 align:middle line:84%
You are not really
with the metal.

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:90%
You're holding the straw.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.026 align:middle line:84%
And so it's able to
pivot inside the straw.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.525 align:middle line:84%
So what I have
people do-- and there

00:13:39.525 --> 00:13:42.024 align:middle line:84%
have been so many YouTubes that
have been put up about this.

00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:44.559 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if anybody
wants to Google Alby Einstein

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
wands, or my name
and Einstein wands,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
they'll see all these things.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Think of something
negative, like something

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.395 align:middle line:90%
scary and frightening.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And again-- OK.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
See now, look how my wands
have crossed in on each other.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That started
off in the beginning.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: OK.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.705 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's think
of something--

00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
think of the most
exciting thing.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.704 align:middle line:84%
Like, wow, your new
book just came out.

00:14:06.704 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
exciting thing ever.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be traveling
all over the world,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.789 align:middle line:90%
promoting your book.

00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at it.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They just open up completely.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Or mine did.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.492 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe that
was scary to me.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, it's true.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
It does give you
some-- But people

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:90%
are using these to find things.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you were thinking
about the interview.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But just really kind
of think about it.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes
and think about--

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't have to be that.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.875 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that isn't
exciting to you.

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:34.149 align:middle line:84%
Think of something that
makes you joyful and happy.

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And do I close my eyes?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.148 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: You can.

00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, whatever.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But just think of, like,
the most exciting thing

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.722 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, yours
are going over there.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Something exciting
to you over there.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the mountains.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Aren't the mountains
that direction?

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.326 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
exciting to me.

00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:50.515 align:middle line:90%
I love mountains.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
about my daughter.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.807 align:middle line:90%
So that's really cool.

00:14:52.807 --> 00:14:55.056 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Or maybe it's
pointing towards your daughter.

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
direction we are.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.514 align:middle line:84%
People will use them
sometimes to find things.

00:14:59.514 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
People have been using them
for all kinds of things.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, it's
been really fun.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, there's
somebody YouTubes

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
up now with people
using these wands.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
People take them down to
the bar for party tricks.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
People are like, whoa,
that's-- Because again,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
this is something you can
see with your own two eyes.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.694 align:middle line:84%
If you have visible
proof, you're

00:15:14.694 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:90%
more likely to believe it.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.719 align:middle line:84%
So the wands have
been really powerful.

00:15:17.719 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Something
for people-- Now, I

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.889 align:middle line:84%
know that your book has also
been very, very well-received

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: 34 languages,
at last count.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There might be-- it
may be up to more,

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but the last I
heard-- last I asked.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.523 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there a
particular country

00:15:29.523 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that stood out in your mind
that was really interested?

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, in Japan, it
sold like--I don't know--

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:90%
a quarter million copies.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's been really
popular in Japan.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.441 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know
how on Twitter, you

00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
see-- all these tweets are on
there in the Japanese language.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.924 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what they say.

00:15:44.924 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I get all these Facebook
messages, all in Japanese.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to Japan to
give a workshop in October.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's so cute.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the guys that's
hosting me over there, he

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:84%
just-- you know that song-- Bob
Marley, "Three Little Birds"?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.067 align:middle line:84%
He just did a song on
his little guitar--

00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's a guitar--
a special guitar--

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
they make in southern Japan.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And he's singing that song.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's singing,
"don't worry, be happy."

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was just so cute!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.375 align:middle line:84%
You know, all the Japanese
accent, or whatever.

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so he just sent that
to me, which was a lot of fun.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Because that is
sort of the message,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that if you get on the
joy channel-- again,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that's that frequency where
it's your natural frequency.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it's
supposed to be.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you get on
that frequency,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and life just starts
working for you.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.657 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try to
teach people in my books.

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
I'm trying to teach,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm just telling them about it.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.756 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
giving the example.

00:16:33.756 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, universe,
you've got 48 hours,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
show me the money.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Or show me the something.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you hear from people that
it actually works for them?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Or do you hear--

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.914 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Oh, all the time!

00:16:45.914 --> 00:16:47.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you give me a
story or example of one?

00:16:47.996 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, "E Cubed"
is filled with stories.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:90%
The chapter's called Well, Duh!

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.214 align:middle line:84%
And then so I go through
the nine principles again,

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and then I talk about
some of the letters that

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
have come into me.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
One woman manifested
$100,000 she

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
was totally unprepared for that
just came in out of the blue.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a pretty--
again, because we're talking

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.114 align:middle line:84%
money, that's sort of one
a lot of people, I think,

00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:08.681 align:middle line:90%
have baggage around that one.

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Of the interesting
ones-- I have one

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
where you try to send
a message to someone.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this one
woman decided she

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
wanted to communicate
with her Aunt Neva, who

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
has passed to the other side.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:90%
But she was doing a genealogy.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't able to find out
anything about Aunt Neva.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.044 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a
mysterious death.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But she happened
to have her ring.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.126 align:middle line:84%
And in there, I
mentioned that if you've

00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:30.689 align:middle line:84%
shaken hands with someone,
you're energetically connected.

00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So she thought,
well, I had her ring,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
so that's sort of being
energetically connected.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.016 align:middle line:84%
She'd been trying for months
and months and months,

00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
trying all these
geology records,

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to find anything
about Neva-- Aunt Neva.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:90%
She does the experiment.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.453 align:middle line:84%
She's going to try to send
a message-- communicate

00:17:44.453 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
with Aunt Neva.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Within that 48-hour time
frame, she gets a little notice

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
from California, which is
where Aunt Neva had lived.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We just found all
of her records.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.212 align:middle line:84%
Evidently, she'd
had one-- I don't

00:17:56.212 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
know-- like maybe her
middle initial incorrect,

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
But here was this whole entire
cache of information-- cache,

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
C-A-C-H-E-- of information
about Aunt Neva.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Those wands are still
moving around with you!

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was really funny.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.356 align:middle line:90%
So she found the information.

00:18:12.356 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.479 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:15.687 align:middle line:84%
So those are the kind of
just really cool stories.

00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the ones, the
Volkswagen Jetta,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
have people look
for certain things.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The idea being that you're going
to draw from the field whatever

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.503 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking about,
whatever your focused upon.

00:18:23.503 --> 00:18:25.309 align:middle line:84%
We animate into
our material world

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever we focus upon, whatever
we place our attention upon.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:90%
So I'd have people write me.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They'd go, how do I get
the butterflies to stop?

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Or how do I get
the clowns to stop?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Somebody will say they
want to get clowns.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they said, every
time I get in the car,

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Emeli Sande's "Clowns"
is playing on the radio.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like it
goes on and on and on.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It never ends.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of funny.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.125 align:middle line:90%
People are like, help!

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:90%
How do I stop them?

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you explain
that a little bit further,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
about the Jetta Principle,
that you'd call it.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.352 align:middle line:84%
I called it that, again,
because when you first

00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
decide on a new car you
want, you think, oh I'm

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
the only one in town
that'll have this car.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be so cool.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, once
you start looking,

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.388 align:middle line:84%
it's like, wow,
they're everywhere.

00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:58.709 align:middle line:84%
And so what I have people
do is pick a simple object.

00:18:58.709 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they can pick anything.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
People have done-- one
of the things I suggest

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.352 align:middle line:84%
is yellow butterflies,
or purple feathers,

00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But people have done
sailboats, they've done clowns,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:90%
they've done monks.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Just all kinds of stuff.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.793 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:19:13.793 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And then just see
how many they notice.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
My favorite story
around that-- and I've

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.731 align:middle line:84%
this a few times-- is
about the girl that decided

00:19:18.731 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to look for white feathers.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And she just set
it and forget it.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Set it and forget it.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:84%
She went off to geocache
with her family.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.077 align:middle line:84%
She's driving back home,
and this traffic slows down.

00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't even thinking
about this white feather.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's off
doing fun-- whatever.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter says, mom, look!

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Somebody must have
killed a chicken.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Four miles along either
side of the freeway,

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.709 align:middle line:84%
as the cars were stopped
down, were white feathers.

00:19:44.709 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't know if a
mattress truck turned over.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
But there were four
miles of white feathers

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the road.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.981 align:middle line:90%
Then they get home.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
The traffic starts moving again.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%
They get home.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And on the mat going into their
home is one white feather.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said the message she
got was that the universe said,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, I can give you so
much more than you ever ask for.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so those kinds of
stories I get all the time.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's across the
world, you get them.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So now, what's the difference
between "E Squared" and E

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Cubed"?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:90%
What did you write in "E Cubed"?

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: "E Cubed" has nine more
experiments for people to try.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But it goes a little
bit deeper into some

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.813 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
block us from being

00:20:20.813 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
aware of this miraculous
world we live in.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.534 align:middle line:84%
I talk a lot about
worldview 1.0.

00:20:25.534 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
what we're living in.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my plan for
the book, I wanted

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.964 align:middle line:90%
to have it printed upside down.

00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I saw the
first page was--

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Hay House would not
allow me to do that.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:84%
They said that people would
take it back to the bookstore.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.662 align:middle line:84%
But the point being
that most of what

00:20:37.662 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
we think-- most of what we
believe-- is a limitation.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's not even true.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's so much bigger than we
could even begin to imagine.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to just show that
it's upside down-- most of what

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:90%
we think is upside down.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So in there, I talk
about worldview 1.0.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that
we believe are fact--

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.199 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Such as?

00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, that God
is a force outside of me.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.189 align:middle line:90%
That's one.

00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
When actually-- or life
is a force outside of me.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.037 align:middle line:90%
I emanate with life.

00:21:02.037 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, what are
some of the other?

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I call them memes.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
something that's spread

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.794 align:middle line:84%
throughout our-- it's this
mental architecture that we've

00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:90%
all picked up.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's important that we
understand that these are not

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:90%
things that we are aware of.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
That these memes are things that
we just live our life by that

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.625 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything
necessarily to do with reality.

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And we think they're
gospel truth.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We believe it's really true.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they're so
insidious that we don't even

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
realize that we
think these things.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just like we just
believe that's the way it is.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.815 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
looking-- like,

00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:35.604 align:middle line:84%
say if you make an intention
for-- I don't know--

00:21:35.604 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll go back to
the money thing--

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%
more abundance in your life.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Then everything
that's not like that's

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
going to come up to
show you, hey, here's

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:90%
a block that you have.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So these are things that you are
living from and operating from.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like a program--
a software--

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're running
in our systems that

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.644 align:middle line:90%
is playing out in our lives.

00:21:54.644 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not any more
true than anything else.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just how we have
been taught to believe

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:90%
in what we think is reality.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What made you
discover these memes

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.719 align:middle line:84%
and what they have to do with
creating your own reality?

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, I
just started looking

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
at some of the beliefs
that people have,

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.363 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
beliefs that I've had,

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.895 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things that
trick us and we stumble upon.

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the events
happened, therefore,

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Oh, now, see,
that's a really good one.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.609 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:22:18.609 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're taught how
to view everything.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Really, life is kind of neutral.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But we've decided that
this particular event

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.712 align:middle line:90%
is a bad thing.

00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's all of our
judgments and whatnot

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have about
the way life is.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So that is a really good one.
"Events happened, therefore,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.529 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad."

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Events have nothing to
do with how we feel.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
How we feel is our
mental state only.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Viktor Frankl, of course, is
the classic example of that.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I recently befriended a guy
who was born with some disease

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
where he literally cannot
move any part of his body.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his parents have to
get him in and out of bed,

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.236 align:middle line:84%
and dress him, and
all that stuff.

00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:53.052 align:middle line:84%
But he has a mental attitude
of just happiness and joy.

00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And he's a 21-year-kid.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:90%
He's hilarious.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the point is,
joy is our natural state,

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:90%
unless we decide to block it.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of these memes have
blocked our natural joy.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And here's
another one, that

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:90%
says "I think, therefore I am."

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So what you think, for the most
part, you think is irrelevant.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, we have
all these thoughts.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And we think they are us.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the new book
that I'm writing--

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a section there,
"Don't Be Your Mind's Bitch."

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we have these
thoughts-- these judgments

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And we think that's who we are.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not who we are.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.332 align:middle line:84%
We are this big, beautiful,
bounteous, consciousness.

00:23:29.332 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts
that just come through

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
are just these
niggling little things.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we invite
them in for martinis.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:90%
We invite them in.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Hey, come on in!

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.498 align:middle line:90%
Let's have lunch!

00:23:38.498 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Or let's party!

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
If we would just sort of let
them go right on through,

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
then we can get back
into that now moment,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
where this bounteous
love and life is.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you--
overall-- do you care

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:90%
what people think about you?

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.177 align:middle line:90%
Or do you just let that go?

00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: You know, I still
care from time to time.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm still human.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.154 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that it's
very unimportant.

00:23:58.154 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that really matters

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
is what I think,
really, about myself.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.555 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I still-- I
mean, hey, I'm human.

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But this
is the idea-- is

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
to start to let go
of that, because we

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
care too much about what
people think about us.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.955 align:middle line:84%
Here's a good one-- another
meme. "No pain, no gain."

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:84%
We all think life
is really hard.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we put our nose
to the grindstone,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
then everything's
going to work out.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The truth of it is that the more
we get into the joy channel--

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
if you approach everything you
do on this state of happiness,

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
like that resonant field of
joy, and miraculous, and life is

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:90%
wonderful, things just work out.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.401 align:middle line:90%
Things just come to you.

00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You dont' have to go
out seeking for them.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:34.807 align:middle line:90%
They just work.

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's the exact
opposite of how we're taught.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that life
sucks and then you die.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.067 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's basically the--

00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And then look at the news media.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And look at all those
things that we've

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.467 align:middle line:84%
programmed in that's not
even-- it's an anomaly.

00:24:47.467 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
All these things we're
reading about in the news--

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:90%
they're anomalies.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They're not the
state of the world.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
They're not the way
things are there.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
newsworthy, but--

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.776 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: I don't even
that they're newsworthy.

00:24:56.776 --> 00:24:59.281 align:middle line:84%
If you think the news is
a representation of what's

00:24:59.281 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world,
we should be telling news

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
about all the people that are
out there helping each other,

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:90%
that are loving each other.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.935 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was just
mentioning earlier how I

00:25:05.935 --> 00:25:07.315 align:middle line:90%
covered the tornado in Joplin.

00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that was a
pretty devastating thing.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But the love that came out from
people, the gifts, and the--

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Support.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: --just this show--
I mean, just unbelievable.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
truth of the world.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:90%
That is really the truth.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:90%
That is what is news.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we should be
proclaiming from the rooftops.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.457 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just not
sexy enough, though.

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the headlines.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well it
is kind of sexy.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.086 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I think so.

00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: We think it's not.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.317 align:middle line:84%
People respond to-- people
love a good news story.

00:25:32.317 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know, that's
a good point about-- it's

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
a great example of letting go
of memes, because we think,

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:90%
if it bleeds, it leads.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.688 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Exactly.

00:25:38.688 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Every journalist loves that.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's been forever.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:90%
But maybe it doesn't.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have a 15-year career
based on the fact that it

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I talk about
the aware show.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It's about awareness.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.421 align:middle line:84%
It's always very
popular-- of people

00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
wanting to hear how other
people do good in the world.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.294 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: People are
so hungry for that.

00:25:56.294 --> 00:25:57.629 align:middle line:90%
And it is elevates us.

00:25:57.629 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I puts us on a higher
resonant field.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
So we just need to hear that.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And those things that happen
on the typical news-- it's not

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.239 align:middle line:90%
really the way the world is.

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That would be
so interesting to see

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
what the world would be like
if we had all of the news shows

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that are out there telling
story upon story upon story

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of what happened that
was good that day.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.387 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what people
would want to create.

00:26:18.387 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: More of the same?

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.703 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or a contrast?

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:90%
I wonder.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well,
you see, the thing

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.975 align:middle line:90%
is, we can imagine anything.

00:26:23.975 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.035 align:middle line:84%
As long as we keep rerunning
these old stories--

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
these things we
see in the news--

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.409 align:middle line:84%
we're going to keep having
the same exact world.

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:90%
We need to use our imaginations.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
We can bring into form
anything we can imagine.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So to be watching
the same old thing,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or even be manifesting
some old thing--

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
some commercial, materialistic
thing we've had forever-- let's

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.291 align:middle line:84%
imagine something
really different we

00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
can create that we can bring
in this whole other world

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.619 align:middle line:90%
with our imagination.

00:26:46.619 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me something good.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's in another meme. "It's
important to look at my faults

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to name my problems and
to strive to improve."

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Meme.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So that striving
to improve-- it's

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.965 align:middle line:84%
what the personal development
world is based on, largely.

00:27:01.965 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Right.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And that just
assumes that there's

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with us.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The fact of it is we
are all just perfect.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:84%
If we'd quit striving to
improve, if we'd quit seeking,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:90%
we would recognize that.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.959 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we would go
out looking for disease.

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get a mammogram.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.416 align:middle line:84%
Find out if we
have breast cancer.

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.452 align:middle line:84%
Let's go out and
see if we have--

00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%
let's do our yearly check up.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's go looking for problems.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of names
for a lot of diseases.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But they say that
that brings awareness.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Go and preventatively
check on your--

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Well, I
disagree with that.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you hear
Christiane Northrop's talk

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.859 align:middle line:84%
this morning, but she said she
disagrees with that, as well.

00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no solid evidence that
this pre-screening is really

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:90%
even helpful for public health.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: And I would
definitely agree with that.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.718 align:middle line:84%
Because your body is
constantly changing.

00:27:43.718 --> 00:27:44.669 align:middle line:90%
It's in a fluid state.

00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you happen to
go in on some day

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that there might be
a little cancer cell,

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.386 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly it's like,
oh, you've got cancer.

00:27:50.386 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
focusing on that.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.176 align:middle line:84%
It's this little
worm's gotten in.

00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes
over your life.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the emails I
got was this woman

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.217 align:middle line:84%
who said that she was
diagnosed bipolar.

00:28:00.217 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And so she started
reading every book.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:90%
She joined the support group.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like, before
long, she said,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I trained myself to be bipolar.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't leave my house.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:90%
So we have done that.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
We've trained ourselves
to have these diseases.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the pharmaceutical
industry knows this.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And they create these resonant
fields with these diseases.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we all believe
that we have them.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not any more concrete.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I just was listening
to Alberto "Volvold,"

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:90%
or however you say his name--

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Villoldo.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed him.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: He was saying that
heart disease didn't even

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:90%
exist in the 1900s.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Nor did Alzheimer's.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.241 align:middle line:84%
So we've created
a lot of things,

00:28:35.241 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
because we need to
sell the statins.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.031 align:middle line:90%
We need to sell all this stuff.

00:28:38.031 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So and again, once people
are afraid of things,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.018 align:middle line:84%
and they start putting
their attention on that,

00:28:42.018 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
we animate that
particular reality.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So think how
exciting it could be

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.651 align:middle line:84%
if we decide to animate a
whole new different reality.

00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:84%
He was saying--
in my interview--

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
there are over 14,000
diseases listed now.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: Oh, in that IEC--
whatever that little manual--

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The CDC thing.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And it can be.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
putting a label on something

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
so that you could justify
the medication for it.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And Wayne Dyer, who we
saw speak the other night

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:90%
says that he is cancer-free.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
And he says that every day.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I am cancer-free.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.364 align:middle line:84%
And he is cancer-free,
which is amazing.

00:29:20.364 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll just cover this
last one, because I

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:90%
think this is so great.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
This one is, "I have to
change, I'm scared to change,

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to change."

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's a meme that we
think it's hard to change.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:90%
We think that.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUT: But see,
the thing is whatever

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
reality we believe
is true is no more

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:90%
true than any other reality.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, in this big
quantum world-- in fact,

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:84%
one of the experiments
I have in there

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.949 align:middle line:84%
is to flip a belief you've
long held about yourself.

00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
one of the beliefs

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I've held for the last year
is I don't know how to speak,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.955 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a writer.

00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.002 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm having
to go out-- But you

00:29:50.002 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
know, that reality that
I'm not very good speaker

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.823 align:middle line:84%
is no more true than
the fact that I'm

00:29:53.823 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:90%
this dynamic, amazing speaker.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So I ask for people to look for
evidence of the exact opposite.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.562 align:middle line:90%
We get these stories.

00:29:59.562 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:84%
We put them on like
a pair of blue jeans.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:01.978 align:middle line:90%
We wear them out.

00:30:01.978 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm not good
at parties, or I've

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.423 align:middle line:84%
never been good with
the opposite sex,

00:30:05.423 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
stories would be.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we just recreate them
over and over and over again.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's look for evidence
of the exact opposite,

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.872 align:middle line:84%
because it's just as much
out there as that story

00:30:15.872 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
telling again and again.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:30:18.413 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, great information.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
The books are "E Cubed"
and "E Squared"--

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and lots more coming.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And very, very
popular-- millions

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world--
all around the world--

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.727 align:middle line:90%
have been loving your books.

00:30:30.727 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really glad that you had
a chance to come and visit us.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUT: Yeah.
