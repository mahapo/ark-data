00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:10%
>> After stage four cancer
took Anita Moorjani down to 80

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
pounds, she slipped into a coma
and was given days to live.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
And the only reason
Anita is here

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
today is because of her
choice to live her life

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:10%
in a radically loving way.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Anita first wrote about her
transformational experience

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:10%
in a blog and that's where
the late and amazing Wayne

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Dyer found her story.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:10%
And encouraged her to write her
first book, "Dying to Be Me."

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Her latest book is called
"Sensitive is the New Strong."

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us tools
to so many of us

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
who are intuitive
beings to be able to be

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:90%
strong in a fear based world.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
inviting me, Lisa.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so glad you're here
really like in general.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I am so happy to
be here on this planet.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yeah, tell me a little
bit about the story of when you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
had experienced the epiphany
in the hospital that you were

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
living a according to
your cultural beliefs.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> So, well, the thing is--

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
so I was dying.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I had end stage cancer.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:10%
And I'd gone into a coma.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors had told
my family that this was it.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't coming back.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:10%
And I had tumors.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I had lymphoma.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Tumors-- some of them
the size of golf balls

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
all around my neck
and my breasts,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
under my arms, and all
the way to my abdomen.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And my lungs were
filled with fluid.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And I weighed 85 pounds or 80
pounds, actually, at that time.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I was connected to an oxygen
tank, heart rate machine--

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- had
all these tubes.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:10%
And I was gone.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:10%
I was like pretty much gone.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors told my
family that this was it.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:10%
But unbeknownst to all of
them I was actually aware

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:10%
of everything that was
happening around my body.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was no
longer in my physical body.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I could even see my body lying
there on the hospital bed.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is I felt amazing.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%
I felt powerful.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I felt free.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And all the pain and
discomfort from all these years

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of the cancer--

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:90%
that was all gone.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And the fear was gone.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a fear of
cancer, a fear of death,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.705 align:middle line:84%
and a fear of the
treatment for cancer.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Those were your
biggest fears?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Those were my biggest fears.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And here I was--

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:90%
I was aware I was dying.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was all gone.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
The fears were gone.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So it just felt
really, really amazing.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't it incredible how we
create our greatest fear if we

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:90%
focus on them?

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And you had-- you had
focus a lot on those

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:90%
You did things different, right?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I did things
very different.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up living
a fear-based life.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of
people live a fear-based life

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:90%
even if they don't realize it.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
how it was for me.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize I was
living a fear-based life.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like when an
air conditioner goes off,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
and you notice the silence.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And you never knew it was
on in the first place.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't hear it.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.207 align:middle line:84%
And only when it goes off,
you realized that it was on.

00:03:46.207 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
When the fear was gone, when
I was in that near-death space

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
or in that death space,
and the fear was gone

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
did I realize that I had
been living my whole life

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:90%
from a place of fear.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.883 align:middle line:84%
>> So interesting, we can
see it in other people.

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
We can say, oh,
they're fear based

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
or that's the worst case
scenario or something.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But we can not see
it in ourselves.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, because it's very--

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I guess, it's very--

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:90%
it's subtle or it's pervasive.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our culture.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, I grew up
in the Hindu culture.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:90%
My parents are Indian.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- a big
pressure on me as I

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
was growing up is that
you have to get married,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
an arranged marriage.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And in my culture, women
are not as valued as men.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a woman's
worth is measured

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
by how good they
are at housework

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or how good they
are at serving men

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
or how valuable they are
to the men in their lives.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:90%
That's how your you're measured.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how you're
more worthy if you're

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
more valuable to the
men in your life.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you get older and
you're still single,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:90%
your value goes down.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
A woman's more valuable
if she's married.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more important
the man she's married to,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.617 align:middle line:90%
the more important she is.

00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But that never made
sense to you, did it?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it didn't.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though you were
raised in that environment,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
it just didn't work
for you, did it?

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It didn't because what I
couldn't understand is how come

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm being told that I can't
have higher education because it

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
will make me too smart and
less desirable for marriage.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have to learn to be a
subservient housewife and so

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But how come deep down
I have this yearning

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to travel the world and
to earn my own money

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and to be independent.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And there was kind
of discrepancy.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like if this yearning is
coming from inside me, surely,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I was made this way.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
getting into trouble

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:84%
one time when we were at a
temple, where men and women had

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:90%
to be separated.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But women had this tiny section,
and they were really cramped.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And men were sprawled
out in this big section.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And I just kind--

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I was really young.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I want to go
hang in the bigger space.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And my parents said,
you can't do that.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:90%
You're a girl.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to go there.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
then how can this

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
be called a place of
God, a place of worship

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:90%
if there's inequality.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that God
made the two genders unequal.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got in big
trouble for saying that.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I was told to go and apologize
in front of the deities

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:90%
for being so disrespectful.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> By your parents?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> By my parents--

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and yet, in my head,
it was like, no,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
but the God I believe
in wouldn't do that.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>> So there was no influence
around you that was showing you

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:10%
another way?

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Not-- well, to an extent,
I grew up in a multicultural

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So from that perspective,
a lot of things

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:90%
didn't make sense to me.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I never fit in because
I was going to school

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
in Hong Kong, which
is predominantly

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
a Chinese society.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
But I was in a British--

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:90%
an international school.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the school, there
were mostly British kids.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were
Indian, Hindus,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and I was expected to go
to the temple every week.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:90%
So I felt I didn't fit anywhere.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I bet you saw so many
different perspectives.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I had to make
sense of all these different

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it makes sense that
you would have questioned

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
reality at the time.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so I was
questioning reality a lot.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But in my culture, I was being
judged as being rebellious.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.065 align:middle line:90%
But it genuinely--

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Not curious, rebellious.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Not curious.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it was
not a good thing.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It was not a good thing.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you had
this death experience,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
you didn't go to the tunnel or
see the light or anything like

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
that, right?

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was very different.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was told by people who
study near-death experiences

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that it was probably because
it wasn't a sudden death.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a car crash
or a heart attack

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's probably
why I didn't go

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
like swooshing out through the
tunnel and towards the light.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
gradual death, it

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
was like I had just slowly
come out of my body.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:10%
But what was really
interesting--

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
I just want to add here--
when I was growing up,

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:10%
my dad and I clashed
a lot because he

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:10%
thought I was too rebellious.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
And, also, because I
ended up eventually

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
agreeing to an
arranged marriage.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:84%
And then three days before,
running away from it,

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
which brought a lot
of shame to my family,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to my then fiance's family.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was ostracized
from the community.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were told
that no man from my culture

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
would ever marry me
after what I'd done.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So I brought all
this shame to them.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you move
away at that time?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So I didn't
physically move away.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So I still had all
these people around me.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I had to deal with
all this shame.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe
that a lot of this

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:90%
fear of not being good enough--

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I
mean by all the fears--

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
fear of displeasing people,
fear of trying to meet

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
other people's expectations.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
All of this contributes
to draining you.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It drains your energy.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what eventually
contributed to my illness.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And then my best friend, I
watched her go through cancer.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I felt guilt that I was
healthy, and she was--

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
she had cancer.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's this fear again
of not being good enough

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:84%
for my friend, feeling
guilty if something good is

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
happening with me.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to develop
a fear of getting cancer.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to eat
really healthy, interestingly,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
but out of a fear of disease not
from a place of loving my life

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to live life--

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:90%
live a long and healthy life.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
It was out of fear of illness
that I would eat organic,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and I would make my
own wheatgrass shots,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and I would source
all these supplements.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But all of it out of a
fear of getting cancer.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.752 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
diagnosed with cancer.

00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you were in
that death experience,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
you wrote about
seeing your father.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.655 align:middle line:90%
>> And having him forgive you.

00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
love-- I mean, this is
called love, isn't it?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so what happened is
when I was on the other side.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And I saw my dad.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that I would
experience a lot of judgment,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
having lived this
lifetime of thinking

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that I had got everything wrong,
that I was rebellious, that I'd

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
run away from a marriage.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'd screwed up so much.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And I put my parents to shame.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And so here I was
face-to-face with my dad.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And all I experienced from him
was pure, unconditional love.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That was all that was
emanating from him.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:90%
It was like he understood me.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:90%
He understood everything.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was transparent.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
to use language.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
We were communicating
just purely energetically.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there was no room
for miscommunication.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I
was transparent.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
that when we crossover,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't just leave
behind our bodies.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We also leave behind our
gender, our culture, our beliefs

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and all these layers that we
accumulate over this lifetime.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Was your father
crossed over at that time?

00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he was.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
My father had died
10 years prior.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And so there he had been
trying to arrange a marriage

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But at the time he died,
I wasn't even married yet.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it was
unresolved in you.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
There's another layer of guilt.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There was another layer
of guilt that I'd never gone

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:90%
through a marriage.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was my father's
dream to see me married.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So this transformed you so
much when you came back in, how

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
did the tumors shrink and the
cancer go away in three weeks?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> The cancer just disappeared.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
that before I came back

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
into my body--

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and I was given the choice--

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
but my dad said,
it's not your time.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And you must go back in
live your life fearlessly.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I actually
understood that what he meant

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
was go back and be
yourself fearlessly.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like he was gifting
me something that he

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
felt he had taken away from me.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that
he felt responsible

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:90%
for me growing up so fearfully.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And so he was gifting me
a second lease of life.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And his message was go back
and live your life fearlessly.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came back, I
knew that the cancer wasn't

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
going to heal, and
that it was going

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:90%
to heal very, very quickly.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I now understood that
it was an accumulation of all

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
these years of beating myself
up and judging myself and living

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:90%
in fear.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
accumulation of all this

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
over all these years
that had drained me

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:90%
to the point of getting cancer.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you wrote about
it in "Dying to be Me."

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:10%
And I wouldn't
know-- when you have

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:10%
other women from your
culture, what did they respond

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:10%
when you wrote this book?

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They responded
really favorably.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't expect that.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't expect that.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And when the publishers
told me that they were

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:90%
going to also publish in India.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said Hay
House India was

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
going to publish and
promote it in India,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I was actually a
little bit concerned.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh,
Indian people are not

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
going to want to hear what
I've written in the book.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You're living
your life fearlessly.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But I thought, OK, I'm living
my life fearlessly-- exactly.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:90%
I have to just go with the flow.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And you won't believe it,
the book hit number one

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> In India?

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> In India.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually get
recognized on the streets.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I could not believe.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That says something.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and that surprised
me very pleasantly in a very

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:90%
pleasant way.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like the women
were ready to hear it.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:90%
They were so open.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:90%
They have been amazing.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The Indian culture,
the Indian women--

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:90%
they've been amazing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> What have they said?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> They have said I was really
brave, not just to do that,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
but they also feel I'm
brave to share that,

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to share that I did that and
to share with other women that

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
they have to be themselves.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the
things I say in the book

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
was how I was
measured by my ability

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
to do housework and things like
that, which women relate to,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.437 align:middle line:90%
especially in Asian cultures.

00:15:13.437 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And you wrote about it.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And I wrote about it,
and I speak about it.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually--
it gives them permission

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
to speak about it or it gives
them permission to stand up

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, I'm not going
to be measured this way.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And those that want to hold
on to the tradition, it's fine.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And those that
see a different way,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you kind of gave them a little
bit of permission to speak

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and, again, there's
nothing wrong with being

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:90%
a homemaker, nothing at all.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's not what I'm saying.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody should be
free to do what comes naturally

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And your message is
more about the self-love.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to love yourself
enough to give yourself

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:90%
permission to be who you are.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
You see one of the problems is
when you don't love yourself,

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
you assume that if you don't
toe the line, if you don't

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:84%
do what society
expects you to do,

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:84%
you assume it's going to
make you a bad person.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you love yourself,
you realize, no, what

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to offer is
actually something better

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
than what they're
asking me to do.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And their expectation is
actually suppressing me,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:84%
but I want to show
them who I really am.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what self-love is.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So in your experience, what
do you think made you such

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:90%
a people pleaser?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was growing
up, my parents were Indian as I

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in Hong Kong,
which is predominantly

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:90%
a Chinese society.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, my parents were
trying to hold on

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to our Hindu cultural values,
and I went to a school

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:90%
with British kids.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I felt was that
I didn't belong anywhere.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I was like a cultural hybrid.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
These British kids all
were together in a clique.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese kids
in my neighborhood

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:90%
were together in a clique.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I would go
with the Indian kids,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even feel very Indian.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
Because I was so exposed to
the British kids at school

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:90%
that I was westernized.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I was a westernized
version of an Indian kid.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't want to do the
whole arranged marriage thing.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
And I was very different.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I felt I didn't
belong anywhere.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, I had this
longing that I really

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
wanted to belong somewhere.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself
bending over backwards

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
with every cultural
group that I would become

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
who they wanted me to be.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was literally
a people pleaser.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I would become who
they wanted me to be so

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:84%
that I could belong to a clique,
so that I could be accepted.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.807 align:middle line:84%
And for me that was the biggest
thing-- wanting to belong.

00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the opposite-- if
someone doesn't feel like they

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:90%
belong, and they become a bully.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
And they ostracized themselves.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, usually, I think even
bullies it comes from a place

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.853 align:middle line:84%
of not belonging and
wanting to belong.

00:18:10.853 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like a desire
of wanting to belong.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I was bullied because
I didn't belong.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:90%
I was the outsider.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I was the brown face amongst
a whole bunch of white faces.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So I was the one picked on.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And that used to
really pained me

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't feel
I belonged anywhere.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But when I had the
near-death experience,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I understood why I
was the way I was.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I understood why that I
had spent this lifetime

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of being this unique person.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it turned out
that that was my gift.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Because today I am so glad
that I don't belong anywhere

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like
I belong everywhere.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have so many
different perspectives to share

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
and compassion.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So belonging turned
to your greatest gift.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and, in fact, not
actually ending up belonging

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
anywhere turned into my greatest
gift because I actually am able

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to see how all the cultures
offer a different facet of what

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:90%
makes up this universe.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I feel I belong to all of them.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So for people who have not
had this experience of cancer

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and going through
all that you did,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
how do you teach them to
have that level of self love

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
without going through
such an awakening?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are actually
many things I tell people.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people believe
that self love means being

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.840 align:middle line:90%
egotistical or narcissistic.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
People who are egotistical
and narcissistic

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:90%
don't love themselves.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And so they're overcompensating.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:84%
When someone truly
loves themselves

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
they're very comfortable
even sitting back in a corner

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and not being heard because
you know who you are,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.460 align:middle line:90%
you know what you stand for.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
You're very happy even to
let other people shine.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the way
that I tell people--

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
or the way that I suggest to
people to ask yourself whether

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
you love yourself or not.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:90%
There's a couple of things.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
One is how good are
you at receiving.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is a telltale sign.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:84%
People who don't love
themselves, who are--

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:84%
people who are particularly
sensitive and empathetic

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and don't love
themselves, they're

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%
very, very good at giving.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they become
people pleasers.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Over giving.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Over giving.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So that means if
you're sensitive.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not able
to express that self love,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you over give, over give so
that you can be accepted.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they tend to over give
so that they can be accepted.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So the people who actually
have the hardest time loving

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:84%
themselves are people
who are super sensitive

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and who are empaths, who
are really empathetic.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
They have the hardest
time loving themselves.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So you need for everyone
around you to be happy in order

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
for you to feel good because
you sense everybody's feelings.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
common with empaths.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, has this
shown up in your life?

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:90%
How did it show up in your life?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So as I was growing
up, I could never say no.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I had a really hard
time saying no,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
which is why even though
I knew that I wouldn't

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:90%
survive an arranged marriage.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I still said yes.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I went through with
getting engaged.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And only at the last
minute, I ran away because--

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You couldn't do.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --I couldn't do it.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But I had a really
hard time saying no.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I was always conflict avoidance.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this always
showed up in my life.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, during my
near-death experience,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that's when I understood that
we are supposed to be ourselves.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was the key for me.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:84%
What healed me was realizing
that we, every single one

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of us, are an expression
of God or an expression

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, whatever
we want to call it.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We are an expression
of this universe.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
trying to bend over

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
backwards to accommodate
everyone else, everything else

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you are suppressing
who you really are.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You're preventing who you
really are from coming through.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words,
what you're doing is

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:84%
you're are preventing God from
expressing itself through you.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, which is why we're such
people pleasers or need to have

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
other people like us so much
because that ability to receive

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
or receive love or
receive a compliment even,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't match to anything
that's going on here,

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:90%
which would be the God presence.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the God presence
or the universal presence.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
What I realized, also, when
I was in the other realm

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%
is that we are all connected.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.325 align:middle line:90%
>> I realized that too.

00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:13.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Every single one.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so we're all connected.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine that all
of us are connected as if--

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
let's just imagine
there's an invisible web.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And each of us are
points on this web,

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and we're all connected.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're all part of one
whole, and this whole is God.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:90%
We're all facets of God.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:90%
We're all expressions of God.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are going to live
from this space of fear--

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:84%
fear of displeasing people,
beating yourself up, judgment--

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're connected
to everyone else,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
then that's what you're
bringing to the whole.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
bringing to everyone else.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you can live from this
space of love and expression

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and creativity and allowing God
to express itself through you,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
then you are fulfilling
the purpose of why

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:90%
you're here and expressing.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you are actually
contributing to the whole.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You're adding to the
whole experience.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
See the thing is-- and because
we have denied that we are six

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
sensory beings, it means we've
also denied that we're all

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:90%
connected--

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that what I do affects you;
what you do affects me.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And because we've denied that,
we see each other as separate.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We see each other as
competition, enemies,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
somebody to compete against.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, when
we have a brilliant mind,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of using it towards
a better world for all.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
We use it towards how to
eliminate the competition.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We use it towards ammunition,
towards nuclear weapons--

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:90%
.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Divisive

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Divisive-- we use it for
divisive means because we have

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
not, since we were born,
embraced that we are six

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
sensory beings who
are all connected.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But you look at babies,
you look at your pets--

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
if you have a pet dog,
if you have children--

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
from the time they're born, they
know they're connected to you.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They know when you
walk into a room.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Your pet, your pet knows
if something's wrong.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what you mean
by six sensory being?

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I mean
about we're all connected.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean by
a six sensory being?

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So a six sensory being--

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we all
have a sixth sense--

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:90%
is more than intuition.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we've denied it, we have
very limited language for it.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you lived your whole
life with your eyes closed

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and if your whole community,
your the whole paradigm

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
lived that way, there would
be no words for colors,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
There would be no words for
sky, for all kinds of things.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the words
that wouldn't exist.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Because for those words
to exist, you need to see.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:90%
You need vision.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, if you
had embraced your intuition

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
from birth, if we were born
and it was part of our culture

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are six
sensory beings, we

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
would have developed a
language for every nuance

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:90%
of our intuition.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And there is so much there is.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, some people can be full on
clairvoyant or a clairaudient.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Or some people can
just have intuition

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and know that something is wrong
to a member of their family.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Other people can see
the deceased amongst us.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They can see-- children,
they can see when

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
their grandparents--

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.137 align:middle line:84%
deceased grandparents
are visiting.

00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just necessarily the
best selling authors that can

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:90%
see it.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all of us.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all of us.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:10%
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:10%
It's normal.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
people who write about it

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:10%
become best selling authors is
because people recognize it.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh
my God, that person

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.610 align:middle line:90%
is so brave for talking about.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's me.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That's me-- when
people read my book,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I had hundreds of thousands of
people writing to me saying you

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:90%
told my story.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
say I'm not special.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I am telling your story
and everybody else's story.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's making so
much sense to people.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
really six sensory beings

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and intuitive beings that
can either see, hear, feel

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%
and just a super--

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And just know
what's going on--

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --is the normal?

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Is the normal.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But we have suppressed
it, denied it,

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and we're scared of it.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And we've shut it down.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, let's take a
look here at a video,

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:84%
we're Anita's teaching us
how, steps on how to follow

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
our intuition.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So number one is to believe
it and to know it and to be

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:90%
aware of it.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:10%
Number two is I would
ask you to then start

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:10%
monitoring your energy levels.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Ask yourself, how do I feel
in different situations?

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So when you are
with certain people,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
how do I feel when I'm there
with this group of people?

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
How do I feel when I go to this
restaurant or this person's

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:90%
home?

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to tell
people what you feel.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not
about judging anybody.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:90%
People don't realize--

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there can be
very, very good people

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:90%
that can drain your energy.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And it could purely be because
you're an energy mismatch not

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
because they're bad or they're
vampires or anything like that.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it could be
your own family members.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So be aware of where your
energy is being drained.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And then start to honor it--

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
write it down, keep a journal.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, keep track
of what energizes you

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and what depletes your energy.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to talk about

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in a moment is if you
need to be with people

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
or go to places that
deplete your energy,

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
we will talk in a moment about
how to increase your energy,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
how to charge your batteries
so that you can handle dealing

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:90%
with being in those places.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, as I said,
it could be your own family

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It could be a sick loved
one who's in the hospital

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and you hate hospitals-- maybe
hospitals deplete your energy.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be yourself,
you could be sick.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And you could be needing
to go to the hospital.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
go to the hospital,

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
it depletes your energy.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
See that's what
happened to me when

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I was going through my illness.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Going to the hospital
depleted my energy--

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I hated hospitals.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:90%
I found them very fearful.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.077 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:29:38.077 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
to know that if you're

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
going through an illness,
you want to be in a state

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:84%
where your energy
is being charged,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
where your energy is
uplifted because that alone

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:90%
helps you with healing.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
The more energy you have coming
into you or the more energy

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling because
of your environment,

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:90%
the faster you heal.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something I
never got about hospitals.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
The very place where we need
the energy in order to heal

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
are the places that
are depleting us.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's not anybody's
fault. It's the system.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I actually really feel
for doctors and nurses--

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
doctors, nurses, healers.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that
you uplift your energy,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.930 align:middle line:84%
because your energy
affects the patient's.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be a really
effective doctor and healer

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and nurse, nurses are angels
who give and give of themselves.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
depleted and drained,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't help the patient.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:90%
The patient feels it.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
They feel you're drained energy.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And it makes them feel
drained as well, especially

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:90%
if they're super sensitive.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They may be intuitive
and sensitive,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and they may not
even realize it.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They may not realize what's
depleting their energy.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
This is why I always say it's
so important for everybody

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
to take care of themselves
first and to increase

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:90%
their energy first.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Because then your very
presence uplifts other people.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're a doctor
or nurse or healer,

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
half your work is done for
you if your energy levels are

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:84%
high because you're
very presence is already

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
helping the patient
or the person

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:90%
with the health challenge.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:84%
It's already helping them
in their healing journey.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So anyway as I said,
number two was monitor

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:90%
your energy, whoever you are.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether you are someone going
through a health challenge,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
whether you are a
healer, whether you

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
are a doctor, whether
you are a nurse,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
monitor your energy
levels and try

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and keep them at high levels
by doing the things that

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:90%
raise your energy.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I love this because it's
helping you monitor your energy

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're saying is
extra sensory beings, or us--

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:90%
six sensory beings--

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.490 align:middle line:84%
tend to get blown
out when there's

00:31:54.490 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
too much stimulus and too much
out of our control, I guess.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying relax, monitor
your energy levels, right?

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, just relax,
monitor your energy levels,

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and don't judge yourself when
you are feeling the like say,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess, fear-based energies or
stress when we're feeling it.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge yourself
but just go and do

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
something that relaxes you
and recharges your batteries.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well and think
about us as sensitive,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and we live in this
full expressive place

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of vulnerability and love.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:90%
And something hurts us--

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:84%
someone does
something that hurts

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
us or we get rejected or fired
or something like that happens.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Someone does something
that's unethical.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we close back down
and say, oh, see that's it.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing that again.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be vulnerable
and be in that self-love place

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you've
had your ups and downs

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:90%
as well even after your NDE.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So how do you take
this self love

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and really apply it to
the ups and downs of life?

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So it isn't always easy
but, at the same time,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
a bigger picture.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing that there's a
bigger picture that helps me

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:90%
through this whole thing.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that I'm
here for a reason,

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and I'm here for a purpose.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I've had a few things
that have hurt me

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and knocked me back
in the last few years.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
After such an experience,
it doesn't mean

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:90%
that everything's hunky-dory.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And life is plain sailing.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through
my frustrations.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:90%
But the only thing that--

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the main thing
that keeps me going

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
is that I know there's
a bigger picture.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But here's how I
actually deal with it.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to solve
my problems anymore.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I observe them, and that's
the biggest shift for me.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that I had to
go in and resolve everything

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and solve the problems.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And that would make
me really stressed out

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and tired and drained.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that every
problem that happened to me

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
or happened on my
path was my problem.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:90%
And I had to fix it.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
I don't anymore.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.929 align:middle line:84%
I just wait and
observe and then wait

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:84%
for the experience,
the lesson to come.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't go and
search for the lesson

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
because that's the other thing
that people do to drain--

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.364 align:middle line:90%
>> The reason-- yes.

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:84%
>> They kind of go,
what's the reason for it?

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:90%
I got to find it.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
And they put pressure
on themselves.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not finding
the lesson or the reason,

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:90%
they're beating themselves up.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they're like
I've done all this work,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and I've done all this cleansing
and reading and workshops.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not getting it?

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't do any of that.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I am a
passenger to my problems.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fantastic.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds weird.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be a lot easier.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a lot easier,
and that's what's change.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.168 align:middle line:84%
>> So you create at a higher
level because of that.

00:35:00.168 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't spend so much
of your energy and resources.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You do create
at a higher level.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is people will say
to you when you do it this way,

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, oh my gosh, I want
the magical powers you have.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But actually everybody
has the ability.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not something special that
I have and other people don't.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But so I'll share
with you a funny story

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is that when I first came
back from the other side

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
from my near-death experience.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And I realized this.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I realized that my
job was just to be me

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and to love myself and even
love myself through my problems,

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:84%
but don't fall into
the trap of thinking

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:84%
that I have to be someone
else, do something else

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and bend over backwards
to try and fix it.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Because every time you
do that, you end up

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.680 align:middle line:90%
being something else.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You end up taking
on a job or a path

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
or a course that's
not who you are,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:90%
thinking I'm fixing the problem.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So I started talking about this
and saying that no you just

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:90%
gotta sit back and observe and--

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and people actually told
me I was delusional.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was not living
in the real world.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it that way.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:90%
That's not how life works.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems really
enlightened to me.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so that's what
they said 10 years ago.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:90%
And these are people I knew.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
people in my community.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Because I had this NDE.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to integrate
back into my community.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I realized I couldn't because
they thought I was delusional

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:90%
because I had changed.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was no longer engaged
in problems and dramas, even

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.320 align:middle line:90%
my own.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer
interested in going back

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to a job for the sake of earning
money to earn a living just

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:90%
to live life.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.190 align:middle line:84%
None of that
interested me anymore.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So I had to leave my community
and move to a new place

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
a new town where
nobody knew me so I

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:90%
could discover who I now am.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So move forward 10
years and my life

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:90%
has unfolded the way it has.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
happens, when you

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:90%
don't engage in the problem--

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I went through periods where
we struggled with finances

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%
because we--

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.020 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't taking
on a job I hated.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't falling
into the fear

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
of working for the sake
of not having money.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when you're
in that passenger position

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:90%
like a new portal opens up.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:84%
In my case, Wayne Dyer
discovered my story.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Something you never expect.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like another
dimension just opens up.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And so things started to unfold.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, those same people
from all those years

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
ago who said I was delusional
who are still stuck in jobs

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.870 align:middle line:90%
they hate, they come to me.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And they say, how do
you do what you do?

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, we want your life.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I guess, you
just got to be delusional.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is amazing the
miraculous way that everything

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:90%
unfolded.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You wrote about your story
on a blog, on an NDE website.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it
got to Wayne Dyer.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And he picked up the--
he just said this

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
has to be made into a book.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was struggling at
one point before Wayne Dyer got

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:90%
my story.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I was not-- I didn't know how we
were going to support ourselves

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
financially because
I wanted to find

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:84%
some work that was conscious
work that also supported me.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But I realized we live in a
paradigm that doesn't always

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
financially support
conscious work.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You lived in that paradigm.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We lived in that
paradigm-- no longer.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I lived in that
world, that community that

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support conscious work.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So I literally spoke
to the heavens.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said you set me back for
a reason, show me that reason.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, take me
back over there--

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's that.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I have that
same conversation.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that was the
life that gave me cancer.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and that faith,
living in that faith,

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
it's counterintuitive
to everything else--

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:84%
the fear-based world
and the top down

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.720 align:middle line:90%
control mentality and anything.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's counterintuitive
to all of that, but--

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It is totally.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that guide
or whatever guidance,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.900 align:middle line:90%
you constantly say I came back--

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:90%
What's the next step?

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, So I'm constantly
asking for guidance.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm constantly
receiving guidance.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the next step
for me, I actually

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:90%
share my guidance with people.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But I tell people that
we all have access to it.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:55.820 align:middle line:84%
My own next step is in talking
to people about tapping

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:90%
into their own intuition.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:84%
See the thing is previously, I
would talk about how we were--

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:08.630 align:middle line:84%
how everything we've been taught
is counter to what we actually

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:84%
need to know to live
happy, productive lives,

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:90%
happy healthy, productive lives.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wrote about
in my second book, "What

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:90%
if This is Heaven."

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about how everything
is the opposite.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So, now, where I
want to take people

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is I want people to look
at things like illnesses

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.100 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I want them to look at
problems differently,

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:90%
health challenges differently.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I would love for
doctors and hospitals

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to really get on board because.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
When I was going
through my own illness,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared of hospitals.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I was so fearful of hospitals.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
When I was on the other side,
when I was in that realm,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the biggest
contributor to my illness

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
was fear.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
ironical that the place where

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I would go to for healing
was the place that

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.120 align:middle line:90%
scared me the most.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's true, hospitals
do need to transform that,

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.810 align:middle line:84%
where their medicine is
brilliant, and it's great.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
to play a part in it

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:84%
as the patient to contribute
to seeing yourself whole again

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and contribute to
the healing process.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It cannot just be
the outside in.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's not spoken
about in hospitals

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.595 align:middle line:84%
because they're into acute
care and evidence and numbers.

00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And they want to do what's
proven and what's right.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But you as the
patient, absolutely,

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:84%
have the other piece
of the equation.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Can we touch again on
"What if This is Heaven?"

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I got from that
book is what if we are living

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:90%
in a place of heaven?

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
What if everything
that we're creating

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is a divine experience,
even the fear,

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:84%
even that all of the
chaos in the world?

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you meant by that?

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in a way--
yes and no, actually.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to
convey in that book

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we could be living
in heaven if we knew, if only

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:84%
we knew that we are actually
creating the opposite.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Originally, when I wrote
the book, the title I had

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:90%
was "What if This is Heaven?"

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And the subtitle was, "And
if it is, Then Why Does it

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Feel like Hell?"

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But a few people suggested
that I should change the title

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and not use the word
hell in the title.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But that actually depicts what
I was trying to say is that

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.050 align:middle line:84%
why does it sometimes
not feel like heaven.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Because in actuality,
we came here--

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:84%
our intention was to come here
and have a positive experience.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:90%
How did we get it so wrong?

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
That's really what I try
to explore in this book.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:90%
How did we get it so wrong?

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I talk about

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
is that we got it so wrong
because we actually knew--

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.190 align:middle line:84%
we came here with life's
calling, with the longing,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:90%
with an intention.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I see the word calling
as our future calling us.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So we come here knowing what it
is we want to do in the world

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.108 align:middle line:84%
and how we want to make
the world a better place.

00:43:25.108 --> 00:43:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We come here with the intention
of leaving the world a better

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.580 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But somehow all this gets
conditioned out of us.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> We forget.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> We forget.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Somehow.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe we forget
because our paradigm,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:90%
the way we've structured it--

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:84%
our education system,
our medical system.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:46.985 align:middle line:90%
>> It kicks us out.

00:43:46.985 --> 00:43:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It kicks us out.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and it conditions us using fear
because competition starts very

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.540 align:middle line:90%
early when we're very little.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> In sports and so forth.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Sports can be wonderful if
you look at it for the right

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.150 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Look at all of the ways that
your life is taking you back

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to fear.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's interesting you
say that because people actually

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:90%
say to me that--

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.818 align:middle line:84%
because I'm telling
people, I don't

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:84%
want you to go through
what I went through.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why I share
this with you.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And they say to me so if you
knew then what you know now,

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.450 align:middle line:90%
would you not have had cancer?

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, I truly believe
if I knew then what I know now,

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I definitely would
not have had cancer.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.510 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm very happy with
the way things turned out.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad I went
through what I went through

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.520 align:middle line:84%
because I wouldn't be
doing what I do today,

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have this life that
I have right now if I didn't

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.210 align:middle line:90%
go through what I went through.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of us are in
that same exact boat.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.848 align:middle line:84%
And as you've been
speaking over the years,

00:44:51.848 --> 00:44:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that the audience
is doing the same thing.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They've been through
their trials.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.937 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
starting to become

00:44:56.937 --> 00:44:58.860 align:middle line:84%
the teachers, become
the practitioners,

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.830 align:middle line:90%
which is why it's so amazing.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:84%
There's this movement,
this momentum

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.060 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
incredible teachers,

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.840 align:middle line:84%
practitioners, healers getting
into the mainstream even more

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and saying this is
what's possible.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:90%
This is what's possible.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is truly,
I believe, tipping

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the scales, which is why a
network like this is possible.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing with
the best selling books

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and why you're on CNN and all
of these different networks

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:90%
talking about this--

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.340 align:middle line:84%
it's acceptable now to
make this difference.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It makes me so happy that
it's becoming mainstream.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and we've worked hard.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You have worked hard, and
you're contributing to this

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.740 align:middle line:90%
becoming mainstream.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, I love that you
address the topic of being

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
a sensitive intuitive and
sensitive being the new strong

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and kind of redefining it.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Because looking back,
you were overacting

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.690 align:middle line:84%
as a sensitive
person that didn't

00:45:55.690 --> 00:46:02.050 align:middle line:84%
know how to manage that pure
love that you really truly are.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When somebody is sensitive,
their emotions are exaggerated

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.030 align:middle line:84%
in their own world,
in their own mind.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And everything seems
bigger than it is.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think sensitive people
need to be aware of that.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
That it's not as bad
as they think it is.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I speak a lot about this
because I don't want people

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.070 align:middle line:90%
to take their life early.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And they need to know
you're just super sensitive.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, everybody
goes through this stuff.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that's
sensitive people and empaths

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:84%
tend to do is they tend to
believe that other people have

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.670 align:middle line:90%
more power than them.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.280 align:middle line:90%
They give their power outside.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I was exactly one
of those people.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I like to
tell sensitive people don't

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:90%
give your power away.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They seem to think everybody
else is an authority over them.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They go to everyone
else for advice.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And when they get conflicting
advice, they get confused.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
super sensitive,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.630 align:middle line:84%
we give our power
away to everybody.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are the ones that
are the most vulnerable

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and the most likely--

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're the most
likely to follow cult

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:84%
leaders because we
give our power to them.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And waver and not be
able to make a decision.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But really you need to know
that no matter what spiritual

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
teacher you follow,
whoever it is,

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.760 align:middle line:84%
it's great to get wisdom from
different spiritual teachers,

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.540 align:middle line:84%
but just know that you have
the same power they have.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
They do not have access to
something that you do not have.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that makes you feel that
the only way to get somewhere

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:84%
is through them or
that they are the only

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.590 align:middle line:84%
awakened one or the
only power, then that's

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:90%
more like a cult leader.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> People often miss level
extrasensory people as ADD

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.580 align:middle line:84%
or overactive imaginations and
children tend to be medicated

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.380 align:middle line:90%
for this reason.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it's too much for those
that aren't that way to handle.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I think our society
has let those children down.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I was a
child, I used to see things.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I used to feel things.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:90%
I used to hear things.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But because we live in a
culture or paradigm where

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:84%
it's not considered normal,
and you're considered weird.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And movies make you believe
that these things are scary.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.990 align:middle line:90%
So I started to fear it.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And so over the years,
it started to shut down.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And then after the NDE,
it came back again.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And I realized this is who I am.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.560 align:middle line:90%
But I also realized--

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:53.170 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't feel like
I'm special or chosen.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
getting information

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.110 align:middle line:90%
that this is who we all are.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a paradigm
that doesn't recognize it

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't embrace it.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you feel like you
were the crazy one for being

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:08.270 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But actually everybody
who denies it,

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.800 align:middle line:84%
you're suppressing something
that's your birthright.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's almost as if--

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.530 align:middle line:84%
imagine if you were told
from the time you were born

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
or from the time you
could understand,

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.450 align:middle line:84%
imagine you were told close
your eyes and keep your eyes

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.350 align:middle line:84%
closed because you can't
trust everything you see.

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine then navigating
the world without your eyes.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so really suppressing
that intuition,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that the sixth sense
is the same thing.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you had embraced
it and our paradigm actually

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.010 align:middle line:84%
embraced it and taught
you how to use it,

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and even gave it language,
the different nuances--

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, wouldn't be that?

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We would be using it.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Validating it.

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Validating it, using
it, and you know what?

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have so
many fearful people.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.210 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have people
shooting each other up.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have
so many suicides.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine if we lived
in a life like that,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
where people around us knew
and felt things before we had

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.720 align:middle line:90%
to say it.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Or they just felt that it
was natural to be loving in

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that place of fear is what
it really boils down to.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and if we felt that.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we knew of our
connection and if we

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:34.810 align:middle line:84%
knew that for me to love
myself and be joyful that's

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:38.380 align:middle line:84%
what I'm bringing
to the whole, we

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.990 align:middle line:84%
would actually be more
conscious about being

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.900 align:middle line:84%
more joyful and loving and
bringing it out to the whole.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in other words,
like just to give you

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:84%
another example to be
a little bit clearer

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is that when you have
somebody who's sick--

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:53.740 align:middle line:84%
like let's say you
have a sick person.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:57.700 align:middle line:84%
If the doctors and the nurses
are overworked and stressed,

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that's the energy they're
bringing to the patient.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I would rather my
doctor and my nurses

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to have taken care of
themselves and had time off

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:90%
and have joy in their life.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And bring that joyful self
to me because their presence,

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.400 align:middle line:84%
their energy is doing half
the healing to begin with.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It is true.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.250 align:middle line:90%
That is very true.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So if we live that
way much longer,

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.410 align:middle line:84%
do you think that this
is what's contributing

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to the massive
illness that people

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:31.035 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing and getting
sick and disease and so forth?

00:51:31.035 --> 00:51:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's contributing
to the massive fear

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and the divisiveness, the
divisiveness that we're seeing

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.990 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We are buying into
all this fear.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
all the news media--

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:90%
fear sells, and we buy it.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm saying don't buy it.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But also our medical systems
are fear based because they are

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:84%
focused on looking for illness
as opposed to focus on helping

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to encourage wellness or
creating an environment that

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.260 align:middle line:90%
fosters wellness.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So I totally agree we need
hospitals for emergencies,

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.050 align:middle line:90%
emergency situations.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think for
chronic illnesses,

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
for cancers and things
like that, we need

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.242 align:middle line:90%
a slightly different model.

00:52:23.242 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>> A healing center
that involves--

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> A healing center, exactly.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --sixth sense.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and that helps
people to get in touch with

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:84%
their inner self and to also
communicate with their bodies,

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to ask their bodies, what
is it that's causing this?

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Because your body
communicates with you.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And it wants to
communicate with you.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why it creates
these illnesses.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's its way of trying
to get your attention.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll also to trust the
guidance that you're receiving

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that's in addition
to your senses.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the guidance that's coming
in constantly and to instead

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:84%
of making that about a religion,
make that about your own divine

00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:90%
guidance.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.180 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and it is about
trusting that guidance

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and learning to get in
touch with that guidance

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.240 align:middle line:90%
and communicate with it.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it is, again,
about taking your power

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:84%
back that you have
that connection.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that is really
important because right now

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:24.430 align:middle line:84%
what we do is we tend to
always go outside of us

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to search for answers.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way I look at it is
what I get from the outside

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:90%
is information not answers--

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to have
a lot of information

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.640 align:middle line:84%
because it expands your library
from which to choose answers.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:48.250 align:middle line:84%
But all that information--
not all of it is right for you

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.640 align:middle line:90%
at any particular given time.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Answers have to
come from within.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Information can
come from outside.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.823 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's OK, you just
have to be able to filter it.

00:53:58.823 --> 00:54:00.140 align:middle line:90%
It makes so much sense.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a new permission now
to be the sensory viewing.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.873 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that everyone
listening here does as well.

00:54:06.873 --> 00:54:08.540 align:middle line:84%
When you talk with
your audience-- which

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:84%
you have such a great
connection with your audience,

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and you've really developed a
close relationship with people

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.660 align:middle line:84%
who have connected
with your work deeply,

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:20.800 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest question
that they have for you?

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Gosh, there's quite a few.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So one of the biggest questions
is, how do I love myself?

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And the response
that I usually give

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:37.560 align:middle line:84%
people is learn to receive,
stop judging yourself.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to love yourself
even through your failures.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Because loving
yourself doesn't mean

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that everything's
going to be amazing

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.780 align:middle line:84%
or to only love yourself
when you're succeeding.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to love
yourself even more when

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.490 align:middle line:90%
you fail because you have to--

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:58.090 align:middle line:84%
you really have to be
careful about that judgment

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and not judge yourself
when you're failing.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to be your own best
friend through your failures.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.100 align:middle line:90%
That is really important.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get a
little bit at saying no

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and not do things that
you don't want to do

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:16.390 align:middle line:90%
just because you can't say no.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So being a six sensory being
is both a gift and a curse--

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> In today's world.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's a gift and a burden
until the whole paradigm starts

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:27.560 align:middle line:90%
to recognize it.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's because for
somebody who is aware

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
six sensory beings,

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:36.680 align:middle line:84%
it's very frustrating
to see what's going on.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very frustrating.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't watch the news.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:41.635 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to watch--

00:55:41.635 --> 00:55:43.927 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't understand why
people make their decisions

00:55:43.927 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:90%
they make to hurt others.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> To hurt others-- yes, you
just can't understand it.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very,
very frustrating--

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to hurt animals.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.010 align:middle line:90%
It keeps going.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> All of it.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me what
your biggest why is.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:01.280 align:middle line:84%
What is the reason why
you're doing everything

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing, Anita?

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like
it's my calling.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.570 align:middle line:90%
It feels right.

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave
the world a better

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:10.340 align:middle line:90%
place for having been in it.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to--

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:84%
interestingly, I am
not trying to change

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:90%
people's outlooks or views.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It does happen as a result
of me sharing what I share.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody is a
debunker or a skeptic,

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
convince them otherwise.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:84%
If it works for
them, that's great.

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:37.820 align:middle line:10%
But all I'm doing is I
want people to know--

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.760 align:middle line:10%
those who are empathetic,
who are sensitive,

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:10%
who have gone through the
things I've gone through--

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.580 align:middle line:10%
I want them to know there's
nothing wrong with you.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Be kind to yourself,
don't judge yourself.

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I want them to know that
what they have is a gift.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not a weakness.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a strength.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:10%
I also want them to know
that not only there's

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.840 align:middle line:10%
nothing wrong with them,
but that the planet needs

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.550 align:middle line:10%
more of them not less of them.

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.030 align:middle line:10%
So don't hide-- you
need to come out.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:12.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're sensitive, if
you're empathetic, if only

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:16.490 align:middle line:84%
you knew how much the planet
needs that now more than ever,

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:17.540 align:middle line:90%
you need to come out.

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to take
leadership roles--

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:84%
don't hide, don't
see it as a weakness.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I absolutely
feel you on that.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
envision a world where

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.950 align:middle line:84%
we are free to
feel our intuitive

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:84%
guidance, our sixth
sense, our ability

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to create and to heal and to
heal others as the new normal.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I would love to envision
that with you, Anita.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I would love that.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely,
thank you so much.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.910 align:middle line:10%
And thank you so much for
sharing this vision with us

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:51.710 align:middle line:10%
all.
