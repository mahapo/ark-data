>>LISA GARR: In the
last eight decades

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
of Barbara Marx
Hubbard's life, she

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:10%
has witnessed the creation
of the commercial airplane,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:10%
television, space travel, the
personal computer, and the cell

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:10%
phone, among so
many other things.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Yet this is just a
blip in comparison

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to the creation of humanity.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:90%
I am Lisa Garr.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:10%
And joining me is American
visionary, Barbara Marx

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:10%
Hubbard, to share with us
the story of evolution,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:10%
from creation to
the universal humans

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:10%
and how we're all a part of
this conscious evolution.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
You have seen so much
in your lifetime,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:90%
yet you have so much more to go.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: Well,
you know, if you

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:10%
take an evolutionary
perspective and you look back--

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:10%
and you see 13.7 billion years
ago was the Big Bang, universe,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:10%
Earth, life, animal life,
human life, and now us.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
If you have an evolutionary
perspective on how long

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
nature has been evolving and
then you put yourself in that,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
you feel new all the time
because it's growing.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:90%
I love that perspective.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're talking
about this cycle,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
it seems that chaos has
preceded every bit of evolution

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.612 align:middle line:90%
that you just described.

00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: This is very true.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Crisis precedes transformation.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And problems are evolutionary
drivers in nature.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And when a species
isn't working--

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
there have been five
mass extinctions

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
before we got here because
not everything works.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But nature selects from
that which can create more.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Nature is constantly selecting
for higher consciousness,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
more freedom of movement,
more complexity and love.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:90%
This is such a great impulse.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I feel when we have a
crisis that the impulse has

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
the potential, I say, if we
know we're going somewhere

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%
we want to go.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the key.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've heard the
chaos theory and that order

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
comes out of chaos.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
So is that what has happened?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it the sense
of order has come

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:90%
after these mass extinctions?

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It's a little
bit more complex than that.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
A system is dysfunctional.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, innovations are
cropping up everywhere.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's take our system.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For example, yeah.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And at
first, those innovations

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
look ineffective-- new
health, new education,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
new kinds of personal growth.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But once they continue to
grow, nature converges them.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So while this system,
like a big system,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is getting dysfunctional,
these innovations

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:90%
are getting more functional.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:90%
At some point, they connect.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is a nonlinear,
exponential interaction

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
of innovation.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The system flips for billions
of years, from entropy--

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
disorder-- to
centropy-- higher order.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's predictable.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It's
predictable now because we

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:90%
have so many innovations.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And you've been in innovations
all your life of things

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
that are just emerging.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But they're getting more
and more mainstream, really,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
whereas the functionality
is also more obvious.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about this
in terms of our life right now,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
current times--

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
crisis, chaos, unprecedented
change, constant disruption.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Are we in one of those cycles?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Definitely.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
We are in one of those very
amazing cycles, where it's even

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
more than just a
temporary cycle.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do
what's right now, we

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
can go down to devolution,
serious devolution

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of many species and
maybe even ourselves.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, if
we were to say yes

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
to our innovations, our
creativity, our love,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and our potentiality,
and our high-tech genius,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:84%
we have powers, powers we used
to think were ancient gods.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So just to finish this
point, it's necessary.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can go down.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But what's harder to
see, we could go way up.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Is it really
that big of a catastrophe

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:10%
that we're in right now?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because these other mass
extinctions were massive.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
this has the power--

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
because of our environmental
crisis and this speed that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
we're accelerating the
degeneration of our planet--

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
do you think that we really
could be in this place?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: I believe we can.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe what the
scientists are telling us.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not my personal research.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I was with Ervin
László in China and the big

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
environmental conference
about four years ago.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And he got up there-- all the
Chinese leaders in this field.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And he got up and
said, you know,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
if we cannot change our
consciousness toward

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
environmental sustainability
and co-creation,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:90%
we will be extinct.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:90%
So I said to myself, OK.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, what is really
good about us that's growing?

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's a
lot about us I don't like.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the mass murder.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the separation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the
abnormal cruelties.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Over here, there's things
we love about ourselves.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, let's get
together what nature does

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and innovate what's
creative and convergent.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You asked that question
when you met Buckminster

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Fuller--

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
what in life is good?

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Was that it?

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.738 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It was a little
different than that.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a conference at
Southern Illinois University.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:90%
He was scholar-in-residence.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about
positive options for the future

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
because my theme was, let's
find out what's working.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So he sent his director of
communications to the platform.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:90%
He heard me say this.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
I didn't meet him yet.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have
a proposal that I

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
think women should run
for political office

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
to tell what's positive.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And I propose Barbara
Marx Hubbard for president

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:90%
It was just off the charts.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:90%
This was 1970.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, the
students at Southern Illinois

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:90%
University-- what do they know?

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was great.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thought it was
great except my husband, who

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.982 align:middle line:90%
was in the audience.

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said that,
and you didn't tell him?

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.391 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Tom
Turner, the director,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
just got up and
said to everybody,

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fuller proposes that
Barbara Marx Hubbard

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
run for president of the United
States because women in general

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:90%
should run for political office.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And because Barbara is
for what's positive,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:90%
she's one to do it.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
He didn't mean that
I was the one--

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
women in general, and
I was one of them.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But when he said, she
should run for president,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget the cheers of
the students-- who, as I say,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything
about me, really--

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and my husband.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you were a
mother of five and married.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And one would think you
had a great life raising

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:90%
five children.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
as a result of that?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, I did have
a wonderful five children.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But I got depressed
after the fifth child.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, I was married in 1951.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We were told, have as
many babies as possible.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It was before any awareness
of population crisis,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:90%
environmental crisis.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So with the fifth child was
this really bad depression.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I've never felt it before.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I felt I was trapped in stone.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I could hardly talk.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And then something
clicked on in me

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and said, if I'm
this depressed, I'm

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
going to find out
what would happiness

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:90%
be like because I didn't know.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
research happiness

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:90%
in Lakeville, Connecticut.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I went to ask
all my friends.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Are any of you
happy, really happy?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And what did they say?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Not really.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:90%
They were content.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:90%
They were OK.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that inside of
me, while this was depressed,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:90%
there was something big.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just tell you
briefly I met Abraham Maslow.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book, "Toward
a Psychology of Being."

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:84%
He was the first
psychologist in our time

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to study wellness
rather than sickness.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how did
you meet Abraham Maslow?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well,
I read his book.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I started to research.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said in
the book, be bold,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
because here's the way
you get to be happy.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
You find your life
purpose and say yes.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who was what he
called "self-actualizing"

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:84%
had chosen work they found
intrinsically self-rewarding

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and of purpose.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That could be being a mother
taking care of a child.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:90%
It could be a gardener.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be an innovator.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The key was chosen work
intrinsically self-rewarding

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and of purpose.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was rewarded to
take care of my children.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't actually
my chosen work.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's rewarding,
and it's priceless.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:90%
But you had another vocation.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Then what
I realized in studying

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Maslow is everyone who is
self-actualizing has chosen

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
vocation, a calling, a feeling
that this is very important.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I do it, I
feel self-rewarded.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm self-actualized.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But it's
important to recognize

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:10%
not everyone is like that.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
absolutely OK with having

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
a straightforward job
and raising a family

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.305 align:middle line:84%
and moving into retirement
and enjoying that.

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:90%
That's OK, too.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: That's
fine if that's OK.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you really look
closely into a life--

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because I was meeting a lot of
people who were supposedly OK.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But when I really
said, are you happy--

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt that life should
be something potent,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
something important,
something great.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a personal
impulse, of course.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But I found that people who were
comfortable with their lives

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:90%
were not--

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have what we would
call self-actualizing, deep joy

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
or pleasure in
what you're doing.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It was just OK.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't actually think
that's all right for anyone.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Anyone?

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I mean, everyone
has inside them a yearning.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, they may not
have noticed it.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
They may not have
said yes to it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But the yearning is,
express your full potential.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I think nature slash God
put potential in everyone.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
everyone's pleasure

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
is realizing that potential.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I could agree
with you because I

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
do know people that have gone
through that perfect trajectory

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
of a wonderful career, second
career, retirement, depression,

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and then at that
look at mortality.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And it is a nowhere street.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you said a key
word there-- "yearning."

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a yearning.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a hankering.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It owns you sometimes.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And so then
the real great challenge

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
is to find that
particular expression that

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.254 align:middle line:84%
matches your yearning and
realizes your potential.

00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's interesting.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to
college to learn that.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I went to Bryn Mawr.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Did they ask me
where is my yearning?

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to get a job in?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
In Washington, DC-- that
type of thing and how could

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I be good at certain things.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:90%
It was very intellectual.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a lot of
human potential movement.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that people
don't really focus on

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone's yearning
from their potential

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
also calls for
vocation, expression.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And if a person can find
that, whether it be motherhood

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:90%
or fishing or gardening--

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making a judgment.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:90%
But you have to then--

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people be
mothers that way.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, I was a really good mother.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.462 align:middle line:84%
I did everything
with my children.

00:12:51.462 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But I was always
wondering, what am

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I really supposed to do next,
because it wasn't my vocation.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And vocation is
like a given gift.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:90%
It's an inner drive.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe anyone who touches
their inner drive and says yes

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
gets--

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
that's what I got from Maslow.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
They get not only
self-rewarded, but there's

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:90%
an inner impulse of joy.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yes.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not usually
easily satiated.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, it's
not meant to be satiated.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: God, really?

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Oh, no,
because I'm 88.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to tell you
another time I was depressed.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
One was before I
understood this.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
After I had finished Birth
2012, which was a big event,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and I was there
in Santa Barbara,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
somebody said to me,
Barbara, why don't you

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:90%
declare victory and retire?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm 84 years old.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I had done a lot.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I was, first of
all, disappointed.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.991 align:middle line:90%
But I'll try.

00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm 84.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Am I this compulsive?

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know what to do.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I felt the depression coming in.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.554 align:middle line:84%
And I actually didn't care
whether I lived or died.

00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And then this young man
came in, Mark Gaffney,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:90%
who is an evolutionary genius.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked us
to do an interview.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
He began to speak to me about
his passion for the unique self

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
and the potential of humanity.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And I would say my memetic code.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
You have a genetic
code, your genes.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Memetic code is your inner
impulsive creativity.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your "me."

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Your me.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And a meme is a set of ideas
that turn you on and vocations

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:90%
that turn you on.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know what that
might be, but I got turned on.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And that little
inner impulse of me,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
which I would call
an evolutionary woman

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:84%
impulse, an activation to find
greater purpose, turned on.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And now look at me--

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:90%
from 84 to 88.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
See, I wouldn't use
the word "satiated."

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel emergent.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even more than ever.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And emergent
is a very good feeling.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it
keeps you young.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It keeps you new.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:84%
See, somebody has
said to me, Barbara,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
do you feel you're
getting younger or older?

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And I say, I'm getting newer.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying yes to that
inner impulsive creativity.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I also call it
a compass of joy.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Your joy turns on
when your yes--

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Turns on.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: --turns
on your uniqueness.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
nature made you that way.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It made every one of
us to feel joy when

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:90%
we realize our true potential.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
regeneration is.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And then
you're regenerated.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And I actually don't quite use
that word anymore because--

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I heard you
call it "regenopause."

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I went through regenopause.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And regenopause was, of
course, I had no more eggs.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%
50 years old.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was 50, so I no
longer had my period.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:90%
No more eggs.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So then usually, it has been
said that it's a declining--

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:90%
you're not so beautiful.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And you lose your
attractiveness and all.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:90%
So I was 50 with this.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
you know what?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm the egg now.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, I'm not
reproducing the species.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving birth to the
impulse inside myself.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And most women that I
know, just like you, Lisa--

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you're not doing this because
you're forced to do this.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's an impulse of creativity.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it in you.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So I then began to find what
is my impulsive creativity.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And basically, this book,
"Conscious Evolution"--

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:10%
it was to make evolution
more conscious as to more

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, more freedom,
more love, more creativity.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And as that happened,
I became joyful.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.854 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And continue to be.

00:17:04.854 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And now
you would never

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
use the word
"satiation" for this.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I will never
use that word again.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.568 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And the word
"fulfilled" is all right.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like you're
filled up, and now that's it.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Because after Birth
2012, which was

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:84%
a very big, successful
event, I could just say,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:90%
oh, I did something really good.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.514 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the world.

00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: But the nature of
the impulse of creativity--

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
if you think of that spiral,
the core of the spiral

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is creativity, more life,
more love, more purpose.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think life
extension is going to happen.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Life extension?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Longer
and longer lives

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.255 align:middle line:84%
and eventually understanding
the phenomenon of why

00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:90%
do the telomeres get short.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
How could you help
them lengthen?

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge industry
looking at this.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
with one of them.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:90%
He was about 65.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I don't know
that I have to really--

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know when I'll die.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is, when
I get to be 88 like you,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, that means we will have
discovered at least five years

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
more, how to keep you alive
to 98 or 10 more years.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And then you get to 98.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But the aging process will be
so well-discovered by the time

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.995 align:middle line:90%
you're 98, Barbara.

00:18:25.995 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
that I even care.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I have a
yearning for a long life.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
But here's a clue.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If we live at a time of possible
breakdown of our entire system

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is a time
of breakthrough,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually attracted
to the breakthroughs.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to be here to
see the convergence.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to be here to see
synergistic democracy.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You want to see it.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.313 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I want
to be it and see it.

00:18:52.313 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You want to
be it and see it.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact
that you in 1984 ran

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
on the vice
presidential candidate

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:90%
on the Democratic ticket.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely phenomenal.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
have a clip of it.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I found this clip because
everything that you're saying

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
can be said right
here, right now today.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.582 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:19:12.582 --> 00:19:15.042 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: Thank you very much.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:10%
Thank you to the 202 delegates
who placed my nomination.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:10%
And thank you to the Democratic
Party and the American system

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:10%
that allows a citizen
politician to come forth

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:10%
and seek the nomination
for vice president.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
The theme of my
campaign is to fulfill

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
the dream of a campaign
for a positive future.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1776, our forebears
freed the individual

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:84%
from the tyranny of the
divine right of kings.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
They stated the
self-evident truth

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that all men are
created equal when there

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:90%
was no equality in the world.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
There were kings and subjects,
classes and races, sexism.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Yet the power of the word
of truth changed the world.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
In 1984, we face a tyranny
far greater than King George.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeking a
freedom even greater

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:90%
than that of the individual.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:10%
The tyranny we
face is the threat

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:10%
of the extinction
of the human race.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:10%
And the freedom we seek
is the emancipation

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:10%
of the genius of the human
race to fulfill our highest

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:10%
potential.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Isn't that
still true today?

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
think when you see that?

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I'm actually
thrilled to know, first

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of all, that I could do
it or anyone could do it.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the likelihood
of me as an unknown woman

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
being nominated
with 200 delegates

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:84%
from the Democratic
National Convention

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
with no media, no money,
and no passes to the floor--

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I got in through the
governor's wife of Colorado.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't really
supposed to be there.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you how I did it.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I got, I think, 5:30
AM South Dakota caucus.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:90%
They had never heard of me.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:90%
That was just the one.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.437 align:middle line:90%
It could be anyone.

00:21:24.437 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And I came in there.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I was a little
haggard-looking, like this.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.707 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.707 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:90%
My name is Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm running for vice
president of the United States

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to map, track,
connect, and declare

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.665 align:middle line:90%
what's working in the world.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
That was the vice presidency,
the office for the future.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to place my name
in nomination for vice president

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
so I can declare from
your great platform

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that the Democratic Party
is interested in connecting

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:90%
the positive.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give my votes
to Geraldine Ferraro.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, that worked.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: So they signed up.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And every single
group signed up.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And when the
Democratic Party heard

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that I was the other
woman nominated,

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I had over 200 delegates.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I was the only other one.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's Barbara Marx
Hubbard then Geraldine Ferraro.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
It really works.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It really did.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And I believe that
we will have what I called

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
an office for the future
to map, track, connect,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and communicate what's working--

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.196 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have it in
the American democracy.

00:22:29.196 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You believe that
will happen one day.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes, I do.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You talked
about it in 1984.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:10%
And many of those things
that you were talking about

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.834 align:middle line:10%
are still in existence
today, where we have tyranny,

00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:10%
where we have different types of
dysfunctions in the government.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.399 align:middle line:84%
Yet you still believe in
this office of the future.

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: You know what?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't just believe.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
innovations in every field.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're cropping up
every day, like that model.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Here's the breakdowns over here.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We have innovations--
you know this, Lisa--

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
in health, in education,
in resource management,

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:90%
in life extension.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
If you and I were to have a
program in which you really

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
connect all of those
things and then

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
imagine them working
cooperatively,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
synergistically, you would
see a new world is already

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
rising in our midst because
the media doesn't get it.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The educational
systems don't tell you.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's very rare to
have a show like yours

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:90%
where you seek it out.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
whole-- as you say,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
my vocation is to
get this information

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.655 align:middle line:90%
into the mainstream.

00:23:39.655 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now, do you get
satiated when you do it well?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:90%
It is a yearning.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
It is a yearning
that doesn't stop.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.064 align:middle line:84%
So you see this,
and you are right.

00:23:49.064 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So those things
that you mentioned

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
about life extension
and different grassroots

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:90%
organizations and health care--

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
these are all organizations
that are started

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
by individuals and
collective people,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:90%
but not by major government.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So what maybe you're saying
is this universal human,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:84%
this collective that we are,
are really the solution.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.397 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that are
creating these experiments

00:24:12.397 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and these companies.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I would put it in
a really interesting way--

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is that if you look at
the spiral of evolution,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and you see us going around
another turn in the spiral,

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe a new human is
literally emerging everywhere.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
reason to assume

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
this Homo sapiens sapiens
is it, that nature

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
did billions of years and
arrived at us and said,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:90%
this is it.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.139 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:90%
There have been geniuses.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:84%
There have been great
avatars in the past.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say I would be able
to demonstrate that there are

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
more people in
every field who are

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
yearning to be more and do more
and love more because they know

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:90%
They've got TV.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.239 align:middle line:90%
They've got internet.

00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Look at the younger generation.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like it
when I was growing up,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:90%
nothing like it whatsoever.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:10%
So I feel that we are
becoming a new humanity.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
And the new human has--

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you a few qualities.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The new human tends to
have a deep inner impulse

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of creativity that
feels like it's

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
part of the process
of evolution itself.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't just have a
nice life purpose.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I feel that the purpose has me.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I am motivated by something
that feels real to me.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's an evolutionary impulse.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
The second thing-- when I say
yes to it or when any of us

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
say yes, the lid goes off
the top of our vocations.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't just want a nice,
comfortable job, and that's it,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and then retire when we're 60.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, the lid goes
off the top of my vocation.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see a planetary
awakening in love,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
showing all the connections
on the internet.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I have a big vocation.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to achieve that?

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't be
surprised that I will.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The technology
is available.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: All I need to do
is say yes, talk to others,

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
see who else says yes,
create an activity,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and then get a few wonderful,
well-known people to want

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.709 align:middle line:90%
It's doable.

00:26:23.709 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
step process that you just

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:90%
broke down there for us.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not just lofty thinking
and wishful thinking.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
You actually have a
formula that you just said.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:90%
You say yes.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It takes the lid off.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:90%
You find like-minded people.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And you start creating together.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And you start
envisioning and creating.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And you also start noticing
that the system either is going

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:90%
to break down or go this way.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So you feel pretty reinforced
by the purpose of nature.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You feel reinforced by
the purpose of life,

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
by the purpose of spirit,
however you see spirit.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel spirit goes inside of
you for your great purpose.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You and I had
a great conversation

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
once about this
universal entrepreneur.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.522 align:middle line:84%
And it combines technology and
this we space and everything

00:27:15.522 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about right now

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.605 align:middle line:90%
to really co-create the future.

00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well. you
know, like you and I--

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm an entrepreneur
in a very similar way.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But the entrepreneur is somebody
who wants to create something

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and has to be able to generate
the resources to create it.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So you can be a very
small-scale entrepreneur.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:90%
You can be a large entrepreneur.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's different than
top-down capitalism

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:84%
because the entrepreneurs
are themselves the agent

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.042 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The self-starters,
the self-motivators.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.541 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: They're
the self-starters.

00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So the more
entrepreneurs we have

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
at whatever scale,
the more freedom

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
you're putting into
the economic system.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if that
level of the entrepreneur

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
is so passionate but yet not
able to support their passion

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
or monetize their
passion or get set back

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:90%
by their passion or sacrifice?

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I know so many people who
have started businesses

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and mortgaged their homes
and really put themselves

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:90%
in financial debt.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.724 align:middle line:84%
How do you suggest to you
that person to keep going?

00:28:27.724 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, first
of all, it's very hard.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And nobody is
saying that's easy.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to network it.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to find others who
are excited by what you are.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:90%
You have to do some research.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to get
vocational arousal with others.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a phrase I love.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I do.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I feel
vocational arousal with you

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because I have a similar
purpose of communicating

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:90%
what's creative.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So if I were wanting to be
a small-scale entrepreneur--

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
which, in fact, I am
because I'm a speaker,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and I have to earn money
by doing this and so on--

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
what I need to do is find
others by reaching out.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you
just this brief story.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.264 align:middle line:84%
When I met Maslow, he was
very, very positive with me.

00:29:18.264 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
going to give you

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
a list of 300 people whose names
I've collected all my life.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was the only psychiatrist
for the positive wellness

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:90%
person at that time.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So he was being criticized by
the whole formal psychiatric

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So 300 names that were like
Thomas Merton and Ervin László

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and people I'd
never had heard of.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to Lakeville,
Connecticut, with 300 names.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.140 align:middle line:90%
So he said, be bold.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So I'll tell you what I did.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I decided to write a newsletter.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I called it "Center Letter."

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'd like
to know what you

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:84%
think is the next step
for the future good.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you tell me, I'm going
to publish what you say.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And I sent it to the 300 people.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is exactly
what we do today

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.154 align:middle line:84%
with social media and
Facebook and surveys.

00:30:07.154 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So this
was a newsletter done

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.945 align:middle line:90%
at the "Lakeville Journal."

00:30:09.945 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have all
the big stuff at all.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:90%
But here's what happened.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I got responses, and
then I wrote back.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I invited
them to lunch.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the network.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brilliant.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: See?

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So I feel there's no such
thing as you can't do it.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was fortunate.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I'm
very compassionate.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
If it's hard, you don't
want to jump off a cliff,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
leave your job immediately,
and try to do it.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to reach
out and network.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have to test
out whether it's doable.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have
to be sensible about this.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about how
crisis precedes breakthroughs

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and how this vocation
doesn't stop.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Look at these kids
from Parkland, Florida,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
who had not only been through
an enormous amount of trauma

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.650 align:middle line:84%
by having children--
their peers--

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
die around them and the
explosions of the gunfire

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and the mourning, the loss.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They have moved
into massive action

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and individually now are
moving into more massive action

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and the support of
celebrities and funding.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
incredible story.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, that's
a story of leadership

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:90%
among those students.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
must have said, we're

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
going to do
something about this.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Some of them must have.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And they must have reached
out and done enough.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And then what they did--

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
communicate to the students

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:90%
this is a great thing to do.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And those students' lives
will never be the same again.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.164 align:middle line:84%
That would be true
for any group.

00:31:48.164 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
world witnessed it

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.996 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So you
need leadership.

00:31:50.996 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
You need leadership.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's interesting,
though, because it's time now

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:90%
for those voices to be heard.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's time now for this
type of movement to happen.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And these students-- it's a part
of their healing process, yes,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to be an action,
which is amazing.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.949 align:middle line:84%
But also, they're
being heard now.

00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: They're being heard.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.780 align:middle line:90%
They have the media to be heard.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:90%
They can communicate.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Any person who is able to
do that with a small group

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:90%
around a deep issue like this--

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and you asked me about
the #MeToo generation,

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:90%
the #MeToo women.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Look what's happened.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous movement.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't possible
before for that movement

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
to get started without media.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Without women
standing up and saying

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
just that-- saying
me, too, saying,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my tribe.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And we need to talk about this
and process this together.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the kind of
trauma that a #MeToo woman had.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm tremendously for it
and support it in every way.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the feminine
leadership at the next level

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:84%
will be, how do you create
a better culture of love?

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we create society
that isn't so separated?

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.680 align:middle line:84%
How do we have relationships
with men and women

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and people of different ages
and races that does better?

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I think the women--

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
if I were in any
way involved in it--

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:84%
would say, thank
you for the #MeToo.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And let's keep it going
as long as we need to.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But those of us who
are free to express,

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:90%
let's have the we, too.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Where do we want to go?

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the men
want to go there.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I am also looking
for that solution

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:90%
to the #MeToo movement.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we need this
moment of awareness.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we need this
time of expression.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.015 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:33:44.015 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:90%
What is the next step?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.171 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: A culture of love,
creativity, and holiness.

00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And co-creation.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And
let's go to create

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the culture we want for women.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It is.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.364 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen it
in microcultures.

00:34:00.364 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time to move
this to a different level.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: That's right.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The Native American
people know this.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, very true.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.368 align:middle line:10%
It, I think, is easier now.

00:34:09.368 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
We were just giving the
example of the #MeToo movement,

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:84%
of the Parkland students,
where it is easier

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to actually come
up with solutions

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:84%
and put them into action more
than it ever has been before.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And there's so
many women who are doing it.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.274 align:middle line:84%
And I think we don't
get the media attention.

00:34:24.274 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's also so many
more issues, though, Barbara.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:90%
There's the animals.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.136 align:middle line:90%
There's so many more issues.

00:34:30.136 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:10%
There's human trafficking.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
There's other issues
that haven't had

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
the platform and the voice yet.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So how do you deal with
knowing that there is so

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:90%
much devastation in the world?

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you have bad
days around this?

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: You know,
I have bad days,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:84%
yes, when I feel ineffective,
let's say whatever I might do

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:84%
or the people I'm working with
might do would not be enough.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can get a
feeling of desperation.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Then what I realize is if
I gave into that feeling

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
of desperation of
being not enough,

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:90%
then I would never be more.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I checked myself from
the feeling of desperation

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to doing something to
make it better somewhere.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And usually it's reaching out.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And I find it's very important
to have people you can really

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
share with how you feel without
feeling you're desperate.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:84%
If I could call you,
Lisa, and say, today

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not feeling as
though I can make it through,

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and here's what I'm sharing,
what would you do to me?

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Would you hit me over the
head and call me a failure?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Or would you--

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Provide help, support?

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: You probably would.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what community is for.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.839 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And we need
that more than anything.

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think some of the
solutions that we've really

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
learned and as a part of this
series are exploring is--

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
universally, people say
to me these same things.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Reach out to someone.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Let them know you need help.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Look for community.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Look for support.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And this all has
to do with being

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
part of a tribe, part
of a member of something

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:84%
bigger than you,
part of a whole.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Part of a whole.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens from that--

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you get rewarded
by the wholeness.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
self-rewarding quality

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
whereby the state of being
itself can be self-rewarding.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say I'm always
this way, Lisa, by any means.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I could feel defeated
and desperate.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But the other
feeling is stronger.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:84%
There is always
something more I can do.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are enough
people now who are like us

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
that we don't ever need
to feel alone, actually.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever
been told-- well,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:84%
someone did tell
you to retire once.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But have you ever fallen
into that conversation of,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.860 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm old now.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And I don't feel that I'm aging.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever fall into
the aging conversation?

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
There's certainly a lot
of information about it.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.124 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, I went
to a big aging conference.

00:37:09.124 --> 00:37:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It was really good
because they were all

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:90%
so positive about aging.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:84%
George Campanelli-- it's a
large thing that he does.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I feel is that
unless you're sick,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:84%
which could happen
at any time of age,

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:84%
aging makes you more creative,
more able to reach out,

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.305 align:middle line:90%
more courageous, better.

00:37:40.305 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In your view.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:90%
But what if you are sick?

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: You could
be sick any time.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So sickness is something
to deal with if you're

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:90%
depressed when you're 25.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Lots of suicides
are much younger--

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
not so much of the aging
people, but the younger people.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is what
to do about that problem.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.320 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't call it aging.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people who,
when they age, lose vitality.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're OK with it.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.160 align:middle line:84%
If they're not OK
with losing vitality,

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:90%
there's something they can do.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.190 align:middle line:90%
They can get on the telephone.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.820 align:middle line:90%
They can work with people.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say there's no such
thing as nothing you can do.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, take
for example my dad.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So my father is 80.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And he served in the
military and then became

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:84%
an orthopedic
surgeon for 40 years,

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
was a great, great doctor,
one of the good guys

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that would play comedy
tapes in the operating

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.620 align:middle line:90%
room just to uplift patients.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he retired,
and he decided

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.794 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to be a comedian.

00:38:43.794 --> 00:38:44.960 align:middle line:90%
So he went to comedy school.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Oh, that's adorable.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And he did stand-up.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's all these
great things in his life.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of the Agent
Orange from World War II,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:90%
he has leukemia.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's frustrated in his
ability to not be able to think

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.435 align:middle line:84%
and remember because he's on
constant chemo treatments.

00:39:03.435 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Very hard.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And his mind is going.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard for him
because he knows who he was

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and what his potential is.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And he's got so much.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
My job is to give him the
life force, is to remind him

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.700 align:middle line:90%
every day why he needs to live.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Is the leukemia
a deadly version of it?

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I have a chronic
lymphocytic leukemia,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:84%
which could become
deadly but isn't.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's a
particular kind of leukemia.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But when I heard
that, I said, no.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like your father.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:90%
I had so much more to give.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Momentum.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And my
short-term memory

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:90%
is not as good as it was.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:90%
That's really true.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.861 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's really
good, actually.

00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: That's really true.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I will just
put down my telephone.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you how often I--

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where I just
put it-- that type of thing.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So then I have to
deal with that.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've told myself
that my long-term memory

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:90%
is getting better.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And it actually is because
I've noticed I remember

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:90%
extremely well deep things.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But I remember into
the future sometimes

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.662 align:middle line:90%
with extraordinary clarity.

00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean into the future?

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, I'm
seeing what's possible.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I see this
planetary awakening

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that will turn us
on on the internet.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.870 align:middle line:84%
If you asked me about that,
I have all the details

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.446 align:middle line:90%
in my head.

00:40:28.446 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And where did it come from?

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Nobody told me this.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has this idea.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I have this idea.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I know what to do.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now saying
maybe so-called "aging"

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is making it possible
for me to be even more

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:90%
creative than I ever was.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Because my mind may not
have short-term memory,

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.159 align:middle line:84%
but it surely has
long-term vision.

00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that you may not

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.559 align:middle line:84%
be burdened by the
everyday details of life

00:40:54.559 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and you have more
expansive thoughts?

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.683 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Actually,
that's happening.

00:40:57.683 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember them.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.618 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who needs them?

00:41:00.618 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's go after the
expansive thoughts.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Someone else can deal
with the cell phone.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.009 align:middle line:90%
Do you get downloads?

00:41:11.009 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: You know what?

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a way of
getting downloads.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.200 align:middle line:90%
It's my journal.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just tell
you very briefly.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I have 202 volumes--

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.080 align:middle line:90%
huge, huge.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's my life mission.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So I get up in the morning,
and I get a cup of coffee.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you'll be shocked,
but that's what I did.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I write my
mental situation.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Today, such and such happened.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:90%
This isn't working.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't figure this out.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm concerned about so-and-so.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Then I stop.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:90%
And I write, dearly beloved--

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:90%
that's my idea for source--

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:90%
double quotation marks.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I allow the-- I called
it "higher mind."

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not channeling.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But the wisdom of higher mind,
however you want to call it,

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:90%
knows.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I've called
it my inner scripture.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The inner scripture of
what that inner knowing

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:84%
is in relationship to a mental
currently problem is amazing.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So then I go back down with
my mental mind and say,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:90%
well, what about this?

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And then deeper
mind comes back in.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And finally, then
I test things out.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And almost every great idea,
every insight I've ever had

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.050 align:middle line:84%
has come from bringing
high-level intuition

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.760 align:middle line:90%
into my mental mind.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So anyone can do this.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Anyone.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Anyone.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a form
of automatic writing.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.006 align:middle line:84%
But it really is bringing
in your higher self.

00:42:42.006 --> 00:42:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It's bringing
in your higher self.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't channeling.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't I don't know
what I'm doing writing.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's quite slow motion.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Mental mind is observing.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go in
with your mental mind

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and think too
quickly, this stops.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's so good as a process.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this course called
Awaken the New Species in You.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're awakening
to newness, you

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.871 align:middle line:84%
need that journal to
bring the newness forward.

00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take people
into the writing exercises.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.844 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes, everybody.

00:43:21.844 --> 00:43:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually
have a clip of this.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.134 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look
at this clip, you'll

00:43:25.134 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:84%
see Barbara in her
writing process.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
This is from a movie that's
been done about Barbara's life

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.700 align:middle line:90%
called "American Visionary."

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.692 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:43:32.692 --> 00:43:35.404 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: I was looking
at Earth from space.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:10%
And Earth was struggling to
breathe, running out of energy.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:46.360 align:middle line:10%
At one point, there was
a moment of shared pain

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:10%
so great that we stopped.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:10%


00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.610 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment of stopping
through pain came empathy,

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:10%
came love.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And Barbara, in this vision,
saw humanity combing our powers

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.014 align:middle line:10%
with love, empathy,
and creativity.

00:44:07.014 --> 00:44:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.200 align:middle line:10%
Barbara is seen as the
mother of the entire field

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:10%
of conscious evolution--

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.069 align:middle line:10%
not just the mother of it,
but the grandmother of it.

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Barbara has done more than
any single theorist to spread

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.350 align:middle line:10%
the idea of conscious evolution.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.720 align:middle line:10%
She's been given
glimpses of the future.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.360 align:middle line:10%
But her time was really
not fully until now.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:10%
Barbara's quest is
to inform people

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.550 align:middle line:10%
what it would look
like if we consciously

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.370 align:middle line:10%
chose to evolve rather
than wait when there

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.070 align:middle line:10%
is no time for biology to work.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>> She was seeing something
that was different,

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:10%
the cutting edge of evolution.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: There will be a
shift of consciousness on planet

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:10%
Earth--

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:10%
the new potentials in humanity,
the alternative energy,

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:10%
restorative justice,
the new economics.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:10%


00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.220 align:middle line:10%
War will be considered
outmoded and unnecessary.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.400 align:middle line:10%
I believe we will have
really developed communities

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:10%
in outer space so
that we ourselves

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.450 align:middle line:10%
will become extraterrestrials.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.172 align:middle line:10%
It's rife with possibility.

00:45:26.172 --> 00:45:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that was a
movie done about your life.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And I got the opportunity
to be in that movie

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.870 align:middle line:90%
as well, which was wonderful.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that you
have contributed so much,

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:84%
yet there is so much
more to go for you.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this awakening
the species within.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, I'm doing a
wonderful intensive for a year.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's 52 weeks.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And each week, I
have a code that

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.300 align:middle line:84%
came from what I call
my "universal self."

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, my universal
self-- or yours,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
or anyone's-- is
yourself in the future.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in
as who you are now

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:84%
when you put your attention
on your deep and radical

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So your universal
self is encoded

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.075 align:middle line:90%
with what you are becoming.

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And in Awaken the
New Species, we

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:84%
put attention on
what we are becoming.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we share it
with the inspired writing

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and with the codes and with
very well-known speakers.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
a great idea when

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.720 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
figure out something

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been created yet.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.791 align:middle line:84%
That is a fantastic
creative visioning process.

00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It's so good.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happens-- and I had
done this because of doing it

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:84%
week after week with
all these students--

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:90%
is that now I can feel it.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I've crossed over-- it's
an interesting phrase--

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of being Homo sapiens
sapiens, looking

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:90%
at my full potential self.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: The full
potential self coming closer

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and going like this.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So the crossing
over is the feeling

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that whatever that
is inside you that

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
is your deep social and
spiritual potentiality

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.590 align:middle line:90%
has incarnated as you.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So who is that universal
and that future Barbara?

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:23.810 align:middle line:90%
What is she doing?

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: She's here now.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:25.848 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She's here now.

00:47:25.848 --> 00:47:27.099 align:middle line:90%
What is she doing?

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, she is going
to awaken as many species

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:90%
as she can.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also doing a
Church of Evolutionary Love

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:90%
every Saturday.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It's 9:00 Pacific.

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's to say the sacred story
of evolution is a sacred story.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the
biblical stories

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and all the stories of so many
great avatars and cultures.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We all have one
single, great story--

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is that from nothing at all has
been created everything that is

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and that we are participants
in that creation.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:84%
The goal in the
early Christianity

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.200 align:middle line:90%
was the second coming of Christ.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.820 align:middle line:90%
What's our goal?

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.755 align:middle line:84%
You could say is that first
full coming of humanity.

00:48:13.755 --> 00:48:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right,
the Christ within.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Christ
within and socially

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and politically and economically
and environmentally.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the women awakening
the world, the Church

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of Evolutionary Love, the
Awaken the New Species,

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of thing
like you do on your--

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.150 align:middle line:84%
all of that needs to
be placed together.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And we need to have a
collective experience

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.990 align:middle line:90%
of our own greatness.

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Essentially, it's
like creating a new religion

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.205 align:middle line:90%
but without the dogma.

00:48:46.205 --> 00:48:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: There's no
dogma because we're all

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.610 align:middle line:90%
making it happen.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a collective
religion of a universal story.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And there
is no one prophet.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
universal story, which

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.970 align:middle line:90%
is the 13.7 billion years.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which we've
all been a part of.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And so
we have one story.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I see how aging isn't
an option for you.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I see how retirement
isn't an option for you

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
to think about and to do.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And you have spoken also
at technology companies,

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:84%
at Singularity University,
in various places.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
intentional communities

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that you've witnessed and
seen and that you live in.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well,
the Sunrise Ranch

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.300 align:middle line:84%
is an intentional community
founded by the Emissaries

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:90%
of Divine Light.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place
where people come,

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and they help run that ranch.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And they have speakers.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they have a lot
of work that they do.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And there is a real
search there for how

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.444 align:middle line:90%
do you actually co-create.

00:49:50.444 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are
many communities

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.984 align:middle line:90%
like this around the world.

00:49:52.984 --> 00:49:54.020 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yeah.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have a big
conference called Tribalize,

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.100 align:middle line:90%
which is going to start soon.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's for all
the people working

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:06.560 align:middle line:84%
on regenerative communities,
tribalizing the human species.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So Sunrise Ranch is a
locus and focus for that.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Talk about future.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a wonderful
idea of this community living

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:90%
that lives off of the land.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in the
community has a job.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Right.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They have a job that
is actually fruitful.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And people come in.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.230 align:middle line:84%
When we have our conference
for Awaken the New Species,

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.220 align:middle line:90%
we'll have it at Sunrise Ranch.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And you are most
definitely invited.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, thank you.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love this.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: In November.

00:50:36.748 --> 00:50:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all working
towards the collective whole.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would bring a community
together-- not that that's

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.977 align:middle line:90%
their only job in life.

00:50:43.977 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They would have
outside jobs-- but yet

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.311 align:middle line:84%
still require themselves
to do something

00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:51.560 align:middle line:84%
that contributes to the
greater role of the community.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And many of them
don't have outside jobs.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.420 align:middle line:84%
They're really working to
make that community work.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic idea.

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
are so many things

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.400 align:middle line:90%
that we can do in our future.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
That's just I would see
a way of the future.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:07.749 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot
of new structures

00:51:07.749 --> 00:51:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that are being built like that,
not just apartment buildings.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:90%
But there are communities.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And people that live
in these new buildings

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.650 align:middle line:84%
all commune together to
work within the community

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.450 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's ways that
entire cities are being

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.970 align:middle line:90%
built around this structure.

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I think the
most important thing

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:30.500 align:middle line:84%
we can do right now is connect
innovations already working

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in an office for the future in
a public media new news show.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to do a new news show.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.980 align:middle line:84%
First I was going to tell
what's his name on CNN,

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Anderson Cooper.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me 10 minutes
for the new news, please?

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, why would
I get 10 minutes on CNN?

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Why not have a new news show?

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I've had the same
exact vision, Barbara,

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:58.520 align:middle line:90%
of a new show with solutions.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And the new
news, and that's the news.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what doesn't
work is called the news.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:07.710 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.499 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree 100%.

00:52:09.499 --> 00:52:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's irresponsible.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It's not accurate.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think it's
downright irresponsible.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It's not accurate.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not any longer.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
have, here's the facts,

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.540 align:middle line:90%
but here's 10 solutions.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: See, even the
word "solutions" you might--

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.070 align:middle line:90%
the new news is what's new.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call it
like, I'm a solution.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Do you what I'm saying?

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm an impulsive creation that's
doing this and this and this.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.240 align:middle line:84%
The word "solution" is a
little bit too limited.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's a problem.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's a solution.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's good.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
building a culture of love,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:90%
of creativity, of wholeness.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That's not a solution
to a problem.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:48.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the evolution
of the species.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it would be
news into the future.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Yes, and wherever
innovations are working.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.055 align:middle line:84%
And I would take what Ilya
Prigogine-- won the Nobel Prize

00:52:58.055 --> 00:53:01.040 align:middle line:84%
for dissipative structures--
how did nature get

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.590 align:middle line:90%
from disorder to higher order?

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.020 align:middle line:10%
By connecting what's
innovative and creative

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:10%
when the system
is dysfunctional.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.210 align:middle line:90%
We have a dysfunctional system.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.940 align:middle line:84%
We have innovations
that are rising.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:10%
So let's connect--
not only just connect,

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.780 align:middle line:10%
but synergize, which
is, I need this.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me create that?

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I will help you create
what you need to do--

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:84%
vocational arousal
and joining genius.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I end every show is asking
you, what is your biggest why?

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I thought about that
when you mentioned it to me.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:45.950 align:middle line:84%
My biggest why is
abnormal cruelty.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It's completely impossible for
me to accept abnormal cruelty,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it be to an animal,
or to one another, torture.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I cannot imagine it.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So then the biggest why
is, what happened there

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.340 align:middle line:90%
that so many of us can be cruel?

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked, is it
a nervous system defect

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:84%
where empathy is not as natural
to some people as it could be?

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are empathetic,
you could not do that.

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.180 align:middle line:84%
You could not torture another
person if you were empathetic.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you are correct.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is your
biggest motivator.

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HUBBARD: Yes, the
mass empathy and love.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And so by connecting more of us
who are empathetic and loving,

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:35.190 align:middle line:10%
we create a new field
of consciousness.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that word "field"
is really accurate here.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not just any one
project or one solution.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's an attitudinal field
that reinforces love and makes

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.384 align:middle line:90%
cruelty almost impossible.

00:54:48.384 --> 00:54:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
beautiful reason.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And I join you in that.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:51.945 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Thank you.

00:54:51.945 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And thank you for that.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for creating this
incredible energy and resource

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.576 align:middle line:84%
for us to understand what it
means to be a universal human.

00:55:00.576 --> 00:55:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Thank you.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:02.534 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.
