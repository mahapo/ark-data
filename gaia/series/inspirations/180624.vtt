00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: According to the
World Health Organization's

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:84%
ranking of the world
health systems,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
America is ranked 37th,
despite spending $3.2 trillion

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.368 align:middle line:90%
on health care.

00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:10%
And the one thing
I know for sure

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:10%
is education and information is
a great solution for self care

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:10%
and really getting beneath
the surface when it

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:10%
comes to your personal health.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is
pharmacist, nutritionist,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.055 align:middle line:84%
and cosmetic chemist
Ben Fuchs, who

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
has written thousands
of online articles,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the top
health myths and solutions.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Hi, welcome.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.779 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN FUCHS: Thank you.

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me, how
did you get so interested

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in your level of health?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're really
detailed about it.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You know, I'm
not really into health.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:10%
Health is one aspect
of what I talk about.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
Everything I talk about, and
I talk about a lot of things,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:10%
as you know, has one
theme, has a line

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:10%
that runs underneath all these
various, seemingly diverse

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:10%
topics.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's empowerment.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave my
mark on the world

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
so that the world is better
because I was in it--

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --people are more
powerful because I somehow

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And so everything I
do is not necessarily

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
about health, although
that's one aspect of it.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.976 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ultimately, that
is the goal, that you

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:90%
left an incredible mark.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So right now, health has
so many different types

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of stigmas around it.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that
statistic earlier.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Health care in America,
I mean, it really

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.035 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of
confusion around it.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: There's
something wrong.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.951 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, there's
something wrong,

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
which makes me think
it's gotta get back

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:90%
into the hands of the people.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: Well, education is a
big part, like you were saying.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: Education and
information is a big part.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And the word "education"
is very interesting to me.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:10%
And I love words.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm kind of a wordsmith.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always like the
derivation of words.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And "education" is a
really interesting word.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the root "educt,"
which means "to pull out."

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So when you educate,
when you're truly educating,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
you're not telling
somebody anything.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
You're pulling out of them
what they already know.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And so when we educate
about health, what we're doing

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
is really telling people things
that, intuitively, they know.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively, they know that
they have to eat a certain way.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively they know
they have to exercise.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively, they know that
they have to use supplements

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.943 align:middle line:84%
or they have to have
correct thoughts.

00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're not telling
anybody anything weird.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But we have a medical
model in place

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
that we trust that doesn't
emphasize that idea

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
of education and information.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.001 align:middle line:84%
You know, the original meaning
of "doctor" is educator.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The word "doctor"
means "to educate."

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And so a true doctor
is an educator.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.065 align:middle line:84%
A true doctor is somebody who
pulls out wisdom out of you

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
that you already know.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we have
such a problem, I believe,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
is because we've lost
sight of the fact

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need
to be medicalizing.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:90%
We need to be educating.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:90%
We need to be informing.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
We need to be telling
people about their bodies.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.811 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say what I
do is about empowerment.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I share information
that makes people more powerful.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.545 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when I
do my presentations now

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
via YouTube and on the
internet, there's a certain--

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.044 align:middle line:90%
people feel stronger.

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
They feel better when
they listen to it.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people pay
attention to what I'm saying.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.555 align:middle line:84%
It's because the ideas
that I talk about

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
are ideas that you can take
on to make yourself stronger,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to make yourself better,
to make yourself healthier,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to make yourself
all the good things,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, to make
yourself more powerful.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It makes sense the way
that you describe it, though.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
You talk about, it's not just
about vitamins and supplements.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's about what's
beneath the surface there.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: The invisible world.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that.

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The visible
world is always derived

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.195 align:middle line:90%
from the invisible world.

00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, the idea that all
there is is the visible world

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:90%
is materialism.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And that says that
everything is material.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.495 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But if
you know anything

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:47.047 align:middle line:84%
about science, and
as a chemist, you

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
know, when I first heard
about biochemistry,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I became very spiritual.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.672 align:middle line:90%
I literally had an epiphany.

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the classroom,
I wanted to get on my knees

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and praise God when I heard
about biochemistry, when

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
it first dawned on me that all
of these chemical reactions

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
were happening in every cell
of your body constantly,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.272 align:middle line:84%
trillions of times a second,
not even trillions, trillions

00:04:06.272 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
upon trillions upon
trillions of times a second

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
with an intelligence
that allowed

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%
them to do it on their own.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to think
about any of these chemical--

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is
incredible isn't it?

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's just the most
mind-boggling thing to me.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So, you
know, to me we are

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:90%
marginalizing our magnificence.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We are not sitting with
the miraculous nature

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:90%
of what we are.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I get that.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.985 align:middle line:84%
I have always been amazed
by the innate intelligence

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:29.785 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:30.585 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even from the embryo.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.251 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes, how that happened.

00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how cell knows
to go to the hand and the--

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: How?

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was watching
my baby develop.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.174 align:middle line:84%
And now that we get to see
these brilliant ultrasounds,

00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:84%
you just look at that
and you're in awe.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes, yes.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what religion
should really be.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.698 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: This is
the true religion.

00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the miraculous
nature of the human body,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a metaphor for
the unbelievable nature

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.525 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're talking
about this whole idea

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of the invisible world and
the visible world, all of that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
arises from something
that is invisible.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand
it by implication.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not thinking,
you're not making your liver.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Something's doing your liver.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right now.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's not you, right?

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Something is doing your body.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But we know through science,
through quantum, you know,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
we know that at the
level of reality

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
we see is the end result
of quantum phenomena

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:90%
that are not even microscopic.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They are not even
sub-microscopic.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They are happening at the
tiniest of the tiniest levels.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And even that, before that,
you're into empty space.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So now empty space is being
turned into the visible world.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So this idea that
the invisible world

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
leads to the visible world
flies in the face of what

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
the medical model teaches us.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the medical model
was birthed at a time

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that represents historically
the culmination of materialism.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
See, materialism
really didn't get

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
going-- it started, roughly,
around the Enlightenment,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:90%
like the 1600s, right?

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.482 align:middle line:90%
And it got going.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It got going and going.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And it peaked in the late 1800s,
to the point where they wanted

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to close the patent office.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.015 align:middle line:84%
They thought they
knew everything

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
about every invention
that's ever been done.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
All physics has already
been discovered.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.731 align:middle line:84%
And then, lo and behold, they
discover quantum physics.

00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But medicine was
birthed at the time

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of this peak of materialism.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fairness, it
was pretty amazing

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:90%
compared to the Middle Ages.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Materialism gave us electricity.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.051 align:middle line:90%
It gave us the telegraph.

00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:13.461 align:middle line:84%
It gave us, you
know, anesthesia.

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It gave us some wonderful
things compared to what life

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:90%
was like in the Middle Ages.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:90%
But that was the end of it.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It did what it could do.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, we moved
on, scientifically,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum age.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, the quantum age is not--

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
it sounds kind of airy-fairy
and abstract and not really

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:90%
relevant.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.197 align:middle line:84%
But our CDs work
with quantum physics.

00:06:31.197 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Our iPhones work
with quantum physics.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We interact with
quantum physics,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.696 align:middle line:84%
the verities of quantum physics
every minute of our lives.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:40.317 align:middle line:84%
But medicine is still stuck
in the model of materialism.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, it's
not in frequency--

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Although, they use frequency.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.001 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, they use it
for the ends of medicine,

00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
to take an organ out or to see
what's happening in an organ.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.625 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or medical imaging.

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.208 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Not to align
your frequencies

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.458 align:middle line:90%
or not to align your energies.

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:53.999 align:middle line:84%
You know, and you
don't need machines

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
to do any of that stuff.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem,
is the institution

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:90%
of medicine is an institution.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The word "institution" comes
from the word "static,"

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.237 align:middle line:90%
to stay the same.

00:07:03.237 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great
battle that exists

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
at all times, institutions
versus the individual.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
The institutions of government,
the institutions of law,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the institutions of banking,
the institutions of medicine

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
are all there to
perpetuate themselves.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And the individual is
just there as a resource

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:90%
for the institution.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And this happens with
all institutions.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And an end result is that you
have an institution of medicine

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that prides itself
on how wonderful it

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
is that has led to a
situation where we have

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.581 align:middle line:84%
the sickest culture in
the history of the planet,

00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
literally, the most obese
culture, the most cancer

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:84%
ridden, the most
diabetic culture.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.379 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And out of touch.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's another factor.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
you out of touch.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
To medicalize takes
you out of touch.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.421 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it does.

00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Medicine
is the middle man.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The word "med"
comes from "middle."

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's a
middle man between,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.655 align:middle line:84%
it's like, in the old days,
the priest was the middle man

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
between God and you.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the medical
man is the interface

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
between you and your body.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's kind
of a broken system.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.512 align:middle line:90%
You go to a doctor.

00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And they have 15 minutes
to tell you everything

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:90%
that they possibly can.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's a broken system.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you just
listen and then you

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
have to listen and hear
everything they say.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All that.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take it all in.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you just say,
OK, I'll do what you said.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.237 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I should tell you,
there's two kinds of diseases.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.861 align:middle line:84%
There's two kinds of
bodily breakdowns,

00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
two kinds of traumas
that the body can suffer.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.106 align:middle line:84%
There's chronic trauma,
long term trauma and there's

00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
short term, accidents
and things falling--

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Acute.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: --on your head.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Acute, right.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So in pharmacy, we say
there's two kinds of medicine.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We say there's heroic
medicine and there's

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:90%
ambulatory medicine.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Heroic medicine is the medicine
of the hero, save your life.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.072 align:middle line:84%
You get hit in the
head, you break

00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
your leg, something
you need stitched up,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:90%
praise God for the surgeons.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: OK, praise God for
that kind of modern medicine.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a second
kind of disease

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that has really only hit us over
the last 5,000 to 10,000 years.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really
grow up with it.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.359 align:middle line:84%
And that's chronic
degenerative disease.

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: If modern medicine gets
an A-plus for treating broken

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
bones, which it does,
and repairing things--

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Triage.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.226 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --and stitching
things back on.

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets an A-plus
here, it gets an F-minus here.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine is riding on
the coattails of penicillin,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
is what I like to say.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
As penicillin came around,
and if you can remember,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.291 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine how
life was before penicillin,

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, you catch a
cold, you were dead.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:90%
You could potentially die.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, babies
died all the time.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.979 align:middle line:84%
People would have six
babies, six children and five

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:90%
of them would die before they--

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Can imagine
the world that way?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And you never knew when
it was gonna happen.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Can you imagine
living this way, right?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So then, penicillin came
along, and it was all over.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.709 align:middle line:84%
So people got the
idea that medicine--

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fixes everything.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.247 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Everything.

00:09:26.247 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
because the drug companies were

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.451 align:middle line:84%
entrenched and there
was a lot of money

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
to be made in medicine-- the
profit margin on medicine

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:90%
is ungodly.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't even imagine
what the profit margin is.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We hear
about it in the news.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.341 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's ridiculous.

00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:40.354 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ridiculous.

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So the
pharmaceutical companies

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
start to try to
discover more and more.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.959 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
to create markets.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:90%
So they had to create diseases.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.184 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
interested necessarily

00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
in helping people with things
that would really help them,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
with causes, but rather
keeping them riding along

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
the pharmaceutical gravy train.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So they got their
statin drug every month.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
They get their diabetes
drug every month,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
you get your thyroid--

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, the worst
thing I ever hear,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.456 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
horrifying things I hear

00:10:03.456 --> 00:10:05.137 align:middle line:84%
is when people
say, my doctor told

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna be on that drug
for the rest of my life.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.151 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And I always tell
people, if you're on a drug,

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
your number-one health

this as a pharmacist,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a single
prescription drug

that can not only not fix your
chronic degenerative disease,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but that is not going to
cause, in the long term,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.191 align:middle line:84%

>>FUCHS: No benign, no benign.

00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's no such thing.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because when
your body takes a drug,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the number-one side
effect of drugs

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is nausea and
vomiting and diarrhea.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when you take a drug,
your body wants that out of you

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And when they dose
you with a drug,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
they have to dose you at a
dose that is 10 times higher

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
than the dose your body is
using because your liver will

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
immediately clear that drug out.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So they have to
give you an extra high dose

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:84%
because your body is
like, I don't want you.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I want you out of here.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the nature of drugs.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.871 align:middle line:84%
So when you take a prescription
drug, the most gentle, benign

00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever, no side effects,
what you're not being told

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
is your vitamin C has
to go to your liver

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to detoxify that drug so
it's not in your heart.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.184 align:middle line:84%
Your B complex has to be
used to detoxify the drug,

00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:90%
your magnesium, your copper.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You run higher risks of
nutritional deficiency states

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
after you take your drug
because your body is allocating

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
its precious resources to
the detoxification machinery

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to get that stuff
out of your system.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.157 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't show
up on the side effects.

00:11:32.157 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't show
up as a side effect.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting, so if

Spiritual, mental,
emotional, physical.

>>LISA: There's
no profit in that.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You can-- Look, right
now, your body is breaking down

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:90%
as you're talking to me.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's also building up.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment, your body
is in this balance of breakdown

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and build up.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.985 align:middle line:84%
And what we say in chemistry,
we say anabolism and catabolism.

00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard
of anabolic steroids.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So "anabolism"
means "building."

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
"Catabolism" means
"breaking down."

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment, you
are in this dynamic dance

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
of anabolism and catabolism.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're young and
beautiful and healthy,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
you're way anabolic,
net anabolic.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:90%
You're net building.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Growing, growing.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You're building.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You're still breaking down,
but you're net anabolic.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:90%
As we age, that reverses.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So the point is is
that we have access

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to these anabolic systems
because we're constantly

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
building anyway.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is we
want to amplify and enhance

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:90%
the anabolism.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what disease is.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Disease is when
you're net catabolic.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:90%
You're net breaking down.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we want do is
we want to figure out

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%
how to reverse that equation.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
The body can turn on a dime.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:90%

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:90%

>>FUCHS: I believe,
theoretically,

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't see why it shouldn't.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You could slow it down.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.701 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: We should be able
slow it down, theoretically.

00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:55.944 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, I mean,
if you believe that idea,

00:12:55.944 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:90%
you should be able to do it.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, we live in
a polluted world.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We live in a world that's got--

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:90%
we have to drink polluted water.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.406 align:middle line:90%
We got to eat polluted food.

00:13:04.406 --> 00:13:06.397 align:middle line:84%
We got to breathe polluted
air, not to mention

00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
all the spiritual assaults
and the mental assaults

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.604 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional assaults.

00:13:09.604 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're never going to be able
to test that theory that we

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
can live forever.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But we can certainly age
much more gracefully.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to break down as
fast as we're breaking down.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:36.002 align:middle line:84%
What is the story behind the
Gordian knot, the loop and--

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, I'll give
you the abbreviated version.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't really know
the whole detailed version.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.422 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you
the point of it.

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So Alexander the Great
was doing his little thing

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
in 400 BC or 300 BC,
whenever he was doing it.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And he came to this country.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.399 align:middle line:84%
And he found an ox cart
that was tied to a tree.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what is this
ox cart tied to a tree?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
somebody left this ox

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
cart tied to this tree
with this heavy duty knot.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And the legend is, whoever
can untie this knot, whoever

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
can get this ox
cart off this tree

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to become
King of Gordia.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.605 align:middle line:84%
And people had been coming for
decades maybe even centuries

00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to try to untie this
knot so they could

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
become King of Gordia
and to untie the knot

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and get the cart out.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.503 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
do it because it

00:14:16.503 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:90%
was an incredibly complex knot.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.842 align:middle line:84%
And so Alexander the
Great, being Alexander

00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
the Great trained by Socrates
and being great and all that,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.589 align:middle line:90%
right, he goes, oh, yeah?

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Takes out his knife,
he goes [VOCALIZING]..

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:90%

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And he cuts
the knot, right?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm King of Gordia, right?

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story
of the Gordian knot.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The point being is you don't
need to untie a bunch of knots.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
cut to the chase.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to health, we've

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%

What is that defensive

00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:90%
It's called your immune system.

So your immune system is
your defensive system.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
It is the major system

Yes, it's a reaction.

That's exactly what it is.

00:17:46.395 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:90%
You go to the doctor.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.645 align:middle line:84%
If you go to
medical school, they

00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:90%
say dolor, calor, rubor, tumor.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:90%
"Dolor" means pain.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:90%
"Calor" means heat.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:90%
"Rubor" means redness.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.325 align:middle line:90%
"Tumor" means swelling.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's the four markers
that doctors will tell you.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You learn
that in medical school.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But inflammation can really be
simplified as a beaver's damn.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a way the body
protects itself.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.014 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's a wall.

00:18:07.014 --> 00:18:08.617 align:middle line:90%
It's an airbag in your car.

00:18:08.617 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's what inflammation is.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the calling card
or the manifestation

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
of the immune system.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.322 align:middle line:84%
All diseases have this
aspect of protection,

00:18:17.322 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
of defense and protection,
of the body protecting itself

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.890 align:middle line:90%
from something.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a defensive response.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So a protective response
is a defensive response.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
What is the offending agent?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:90%

the defensive response?

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have a defensive
response in the body,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that means an offending agent
has gotten into the body.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.221 align:middle line:84%
Eating is one of the hardest
things that the body has to do.

00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:31.178 align:middle line:84%
Of the things the body
does on a regular basis,

00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
eating is probably the hardest
thing that the body has to do.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's why every study that's
ever been done on longevity

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
shows the less you eat,
the longer you live.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So yes, every study.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good point.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: This is every study.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It's been repeated over
and over and over again.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.756 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
reasons for that.

00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that
when you don't eat,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
your body produces a
hormone called ghrelin.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of this?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ghrelin?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Ghrelin.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.879 align:middle line:90%
G-H-R-E-L-I-N, ghrelin.

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of leptin?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: OK, so this is the
antagonistic hormone to leptin.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: OK?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So ghrelin is a hormone that's
secreted when you're hungry.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's an
appetite hormone.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: When you're
ghrelin is high, that is,

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:84%
when you're hungry
neurochemically,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:90%
you see colors more sharp.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.122 align:middle line:90%
You learn better.

00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that makes sense.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Your body is more
fine tuned when it's hungry.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:90%
When you sleep, when you eat--

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
it wants to hunt.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It wants to hunt.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
When you eat,
guess what happens?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It dims.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You slow down.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.551 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Leptin makes you tired.

00:21:22.551 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it satiating?

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Satiating.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's associated with a
slow down, with a shut down.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, once you've
eaten, you're satiated

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and you slow down.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Once you've
eaten, you're satiated.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to go and hunt.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So the longer you can
keep your body in this edge,

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in this idea of I'm looking
for something, I'm hunting,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:84%
the sharper your colors are
going to be, the more acute

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:90%
your smells are going to be.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be more alive.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.214 align:middle line:84%
You're going to sense
the environment better.

00:21:45.214 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
See, we get domesticated
through food.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Ghrelin makes you like a lion.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.488 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very true, very true.

00:21:50.488 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Leptin makes

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.089 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Our food, see, there's
a domestication of humanity

00:21:56.089 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that's been occurring over
the last 10,000 years,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.588 align:middle line:84%
intentionally or
not intentionally.

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sedentary.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Grains, opiates,
the opiates of the people,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:90%
the comfort foods.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:84%
When we learned how
to crush up grains,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
we learned how to ingest
large amounts of a food

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
that nature didn't
intend us to eat.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.982 align:middle line:90%
See grains are seeds.

00:22:12.982 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't want
you to eat its seeds.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.959 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't really get the
nutrition or the value of seeds

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
until we learned how to crush
them up about 10,000 years ago.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
When they learned how
to crush up seeds,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:90%
that's when you got Sumeria.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:90%
That's when you got hierarchies.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
got a governments.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
That's when you got
political systems.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
got people, elites,

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that's when you got kings
who controlled the masses.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.866 align:middle line:84%
The masses had to dig the
ditches for the irrigation.

00:22:37.866 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:90%
The elites weren't doing that.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So the stratification
of humanity

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how people are
divided from elites to workers

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to people in between began as we
learned how to process grains.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So all of this required
the people, workers.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
People aren't naturally workers.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:90%
So they had to be domesticated.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:90%
They had to be enslaved.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
They had to somehow
be controlled.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And food is a
great way to do it.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
empires of food.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
The greatest empires were the
Sumerian empire, the Babylonian

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Empire, the Persian Empire,
the Egyptian empire,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the British empire, the Chinese
empire, the American empire.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.378 align:middle line:84%
What do all these
empires have in common?

00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:16.655 align:middle line:90%
They were all grain producers.

00:23:16.655 --> 00:23:17.946 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I was gonna say, seeds.

00:23:17.946 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Lots of grains.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because grains
represent wealth.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.487 align:middle line:84%
And grains also represent
a wonderful tool

00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:90%
to keep people dumb.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Now today, we have an
advanced version of grains.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't have just grains.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:90%
We got high-tech grains.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: We got super
high-processed foods.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Super high-processed foods--

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Genetically
modified grains.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All of that.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the super high-processed
foods are very grain rich,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.411 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And the super

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
sprinkle on turds
and you will think

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that is the most delicious

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, God.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I don't know

the high-tech versions

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:90%
of processed food.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, in
the late 1800s,

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
we figured out chemistry.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.388 align:middle line:84%
We started to
understand chemistry.

00:24:04.388 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:90%
In the early 1800s, we began it.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have these places
like the Monell Institute

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
in Philadelphia where they have
these high-powered PhDs who

come up with all
kinds of molecules

00:24:12.488 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
so you can't stop
eating the Lay's potato

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:90%
chips or the cereals.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't eat
any of these foods

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%

And this, getting back
your story about fasting,

I do the intermittent fasting--

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You want

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --two days later, yes.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.355 align:middle line:84%
I look back and I say, oh

00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was I eating?

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%

00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:17.842 align:middle line:84%

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I eat French fries.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
So the cleansing--

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because we're
wired, we're hard

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.037 align:middle line:90%
wired to look for calories.

00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And from an evolutionary

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.536 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's the
one thing that happens

00:25:28.536 --> 00:25:29.539 align:middle line:90%

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --we're
hard wired that way.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Because calories
represent reward.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
To the body, a
calorie is a reward.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's why we

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:90%
or when we're depressed.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Because a calorie is a
quick way to get a reward.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or you
want to stay awake.

>>FUCHS: Well, calories,

But then after
you're done eating,

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
you're gonna need a nap.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to ask you about
the cleansing of the blood.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:90%

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:90%
This idea of how we--

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: OK.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So I talked about
the digestive system, right?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The reason
the digestive system

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.450 align:middle line:84%
is so important is not because
of the digestive system

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.787 align:middle line:90%
per se itself.

00:26:00.787 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the link
that the digestive system

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
has to the sacred
space in the body.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The sacred space in
the body is the blood.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the bloodstream.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
the sacred space

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
is because this is the
part of the body that

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:90%
touches everything.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's connected to everything.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
disease state, it

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is always going to be
preceded by something

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%
that's in the blood.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have a disease state
without some kind of blood

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And the blood becomes
an issue from its link

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:90%
to the digestive system.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is the relationship
between all of these systems

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that seemingly are disparate
or are disconnected, is you

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:90%
eat a food.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the gut, it
gets transmitted from--

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and this is all--

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm simplifying it.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Because how it happens
is ridiculously amazing.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.964 align:middle line:90%
OK, you eat a food.

00:26:45.964 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It goes into your gut.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:10%
It crosses over into
your bloodstream.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.544 align:middle line:10%
From that point, it travels
everywhere in your body.

00:26:51.544 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:10%
And this is why it says in the
Bible, the life of the body

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.940 align:middle line:10%
is in the blood.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
What's even more fascinating
is as the blood is circulating,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.070 align:middle line:84%
it's generating an
electrical charge.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:10%
And that electrical charge
is electrifying you.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:10%
As we get sick and as toxins
enter into the bloodstream,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:10%
the blood starts to get
sticky and coagulate.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Blood clotting is a
sign of protection.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.717 align:middle line:84%
Blood clotting, it's like
those little potato bugs.

00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
You ever see those
little potato bugs?

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:17.555 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I don't if
you ever did this,

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
but you poke it and it
curls up into a ball.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Pill bugs we call them.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Pill bugs.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.793 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: OK, so it
curls up in a ball.

00:27:23.793 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:90%
The body does that, too.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
When the body is freaked
out, it curls up into a ball.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.865 align:middle line:84%
And "curled up into a ball"
is kind of a metaphor.

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really
literally curl up into a ball.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But everything kind
of closes down.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when toxins get
into the bloodstream,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the bloodstream
kind of closes down.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It becomes sludgy.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:84%
This is evolutionarily
appropriate

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.354 align:middle line:84%
so the toxins don't get
delivered everywhere.

00:27:43.354 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So you get this
condition of what I call

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:90%
sticky blood or sludgy blood.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
At that point you
have two problems.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you've got a
sludginess in the blood.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.225 align:middle line:90%
So the blood is not circulating.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not delivering
its nutrients.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not electrifying
the body as effectively.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.262 align:middle line:84%
It's not detoxifying
the body as effectively.

00:27:57.262 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But number two, you
also have a condition

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.291 align:middle line:84%
where you've got pieces
of food, literally,

00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
they're small pieces of food--

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they permeate
through the gut?

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They go
right through the gut.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
That's called
leaky gut syndrome.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.651 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's a real thing?

00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh, big time.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no disease without it.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There was a debate.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.321 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: There ain't no debate.

00:28:12.321 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:90%
There ain't no debate.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where, when I talk about
the problem being in the gut,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about leaky gut.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:90%
We didn't define that.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's what's happening.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.864 align:middle line:90%
The gut lining is breaking down.

00:28:20.864 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Toxins are getting
into the blood.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:90%
There ain't no debate about it.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
But here's what's interesting.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.747 align:middle line:84%
So number one, the blood reacts
by becoming sludgy and sticky.

00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is
evolutionarily appropriate

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
when it happens once in a while.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But in the long run, you
could run into issues.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not getting
nutrients delivered.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
detoxified, a lot of problems.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.885 align:middle line:90%
You lose that electrical energy.

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
But the second issue
is so fascinating.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
You get these little
pieces of food.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And technically, they
call them peptides,

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.257 align:middle line:84%
little pieces of protein,
little pieces of your hamburger

00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and your soy and your beans and
your grains and all the foods,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:90%
they're now in your bloodstream.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And the body can't handle this.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a bad situation.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:90%
The blood is a sacred space.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.305 align:middle line:90%
No enemy gets into the blood.

00:28:58.305 --> 00:29:00.305 align:middle line:84%
What gets in the blood
is supposed to be vetted.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.410 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be approved
of, like immigration.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, your digestive tract
is supposed to be immigration,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:90%
checking people in.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.885 align:middle line:84%
When you get leaky
gut, there are

00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
people going across the
border into the blood.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.857 align:middle line:90%
They're sneaking in.

00:29:10.857 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So you got these pieces of
food that are floating around

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:90%
inside the blood.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The body does something
very interesting, brilliance

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid
and my mom would

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:84%

the immune system is doing
this really cool thing.

It's covering it up,
kind of protecting it.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.585 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting these immune

shoved.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
After they're in the

they'll eventually get shoved
out into the connective tissue

00:33:48.162 --> 00:33:50.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in your muscles
or whether it's in your nerves

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's your eyeballs
or whether it's your knees.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The body is breaking
down as a system.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And when the body breaks down
as a system, all you need to do

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is figure out why it's
breaking down as a system

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.631 align:middle line:90%
and then repair it.

00:34:03.631 --> 00:34:05.838 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a specialist
for this and a specialist

00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:07.900 align:middle line:84%
for that and a drug for
this and a drug for that.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.639 align:middle line:84%
You just need to figure out
what's wrong with the body.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.555 align:middle line:84%

>>FUCHS: The life-saving

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:84%
No, the lifesaving

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, that's

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.685 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're deceiving

00:34:23.685 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:90%
They really--

>>FUCHS: There's a miraculous

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.859 align:middle line:84%
But they're not going

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the only thing that's
wrong with your body is--

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.560 align:middle line:90%
this is Gordian knot again--

the wrong stuff is getting

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so,
for example, if you

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
have one of these diseases like
MS, your age is affecting it.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:90%
You've got autoimmune.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.260 align:middle line:90%
There are so many--

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And there's the

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the air that you breathe,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But
there's places where

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:90%
you have locus of control.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You don't
have a locus of control

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:90%
over the air you're breathing.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna breathe our air.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have a starting point.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.869 align:middle line:84%
We'll play the
hands we're dealt.

00:34:57.869 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
We're dealt a certain
hand because we

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:90%
live in 21st century America.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
make it to 120 or 130

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.000 align:middle line:84%
because you live in
21st century America.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
However, you have
tremendous locus of control.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
understand everything

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
we just talked about in
the last 20 minutes or so,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:84%
you understand that all disease
has this aspect of protection.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
All disease has this
aspect of a response.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
All disease has this aspect
of the body trying to defend

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:90%
itself from something.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The only question
has to be, if you're

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a disease
state, is what is your body

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:90%
protecting itself from?

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.574 align:middle line:84%
And how can you strengthen
it and support it

00:35:32.574 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
so, number one, it doesn't
have to deal with whatever it's

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.597 align:middle line:84%
dealing with and, number two,
it can deal with whatever

00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:90%
it has to deal with.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if it's
a genetic illness?

00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Then you get the whole
disempowerment of genetics.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disempowerment?

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we are
victims of our genetics

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:90%
takes our power away from us.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you born with
certain things happening?

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.464 align:middle line:84%
But, you see, there is something
that's transcendent to genetics

00:35:56.464 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that people are
talking about now.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But we learned about in
pharmacy school in the 1980s,

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:90%
it's called epigenetics.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you take
a bone cell and put it

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.720 align:middle line:84%
in an environment that
has all of the nutrients

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.583 align:middle line:84%
for it to be a skin cell,
it'll turn into a skin cell.

00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So you're
not condemned.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:84%
A bone cell is not
condemned to be a bone cell.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It can be a skin cell if it
has the right environment.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.739 align:middle line:84%
The environment tells
the genes what to do.

00:36:21.739 --> 00:36:23.155 align:middle line:84%
So the environment,
by environment

00:36:23.155 --> 00:36:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the environment

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.978 align:middle line:90%
the cell is sitting in.

00:36:24.978 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
All our cells are
sitting in a soup.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And they're reading the soup.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Guess what they're mainly
reading the soup for?

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:90%
You'll love this.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.810 align:middle line:84%
They're mainly reading
the soup for what

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.530 align:middle line:90%

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: He said, is the

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:90%

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: He said, if I could

00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's what

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Is the universe

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It's asking it by
reading the environment.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's reading carbon dioxide.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:90%
It's reading food toxins.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:90%
It's reading insulin.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It's reading vitamins and
amino acids and nutrients.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, do I
have the resources

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that will allow me to thrive
or am I in survival mode?

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.800 align:middle line:84%
See, at any given
moment, any living system

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.955 align:middle line:90%

00:37:08.955 --> 00:37:09.755 align:middle line:90%

MS, like all diseases,

00:37:40.199 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And we could say MS,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But what's the most common
place we put things into--

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Food.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Through food.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So you say, OK,
that's a great theory.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.990 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to prove it?

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Fast for two days.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.322 align:middle line:84%
And if you have MS or
an autoimmune disease,

00:38:37.322 --> 00:38:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you will notice your symptoms
improve in two or three

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:90%
days of fasting.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, that's true.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Across the board.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Hidden in plain sight.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Even on
WebMD's web site.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You know WebMD,
right, the website?

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So they are no
fans of, you know, anything

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.523 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about here probably.

00:38:50.523 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But they have an
article that says

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.925 align:middle line:84%
fasting relieves multiple
sclerosis symptoms.

00:38:54.925 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
what I just

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:84%
said, which is not rocket
science, which doesn't req--

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
did I say anything
medical or scientific

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:90%
or hard to understand?

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting, yes.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, is fasting meaning just
water or how do you do it?

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: To the
degree you can fast.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Calorie restriction
if you can't fast.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You know,
fasting is great

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
because you mobilize hormones
and chemistry in the body,

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
like we were saying, that tells
the body, let's get going.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Grow.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Let's move.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's grow.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
let's heal, repair.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So you can go out
and let's heal, let's repair.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So fasting is great.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But even if you do
caloric restriction.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:90%
So I have to do some--

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask you about
some of these myths.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go through, if
we can, really quickly.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Serotonin, SSRIs.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.934 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: OK, serotonin
gets the reputation

00:39:34.934 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:84%
of being the happy
hormone, right?

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.558 align:middle line:84%
If you're a layperson, you
think it's with happiness.

00:39:38.558 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Not a happy hormone.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a vigilance hormone.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a daytime hormone.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It balances out or
antagonizes melatonin.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin and melatonin
are two of the same family.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.453 align:middle line:90%
And they balance each other out.

00:39:50.453 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin is a very,
very primitive hormone.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeast have serotonin.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Bacteria has serotonin.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So serotonin is an
awareness hormone.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It helps you handle the
vicissitudes, the ups and downs

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.624 align:middle line:84%
of life, the ups and downs
of being in daily life.

00:40:04.624 --> 00:40:07.040 align:middle line:84%
During the daytime, there's
all kinds of things happening.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Sleep, you don't have
to worry about it.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Sleep, you're growing,
you're repairing.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.590 align:middle line:90%
You're chill.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:90%
You're at night.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's happening.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.731 align:middle line:84%
But in the day, you
need to be aware.

00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:90%
You need to be vigilant.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Most serotonin in your
body is not your brain.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.270 align:middle line:90%
It's in your digestive system.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Why your digestive system?

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Why would serotonin, which
is a vigilance hormone

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and an awareness
hormone, why would it

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.530 align:middle line:90%
be in your digestive system?

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Because your digestive system
is in the greatest battle

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
there is with the environment.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
constantly eating.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why they
call it the gut-brain.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.916 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's called
the gut-brain axis.

00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:34.407 align:middle line:90%
But this is the core of it.

00:40:34.407 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, our brain
here is important.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But the brain here
is interpreting

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:90%
the environment via the food.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.667 align:middle line:84%
So serotonin is a
digestive hormone

00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:43.000 align:middle line:90%
more than it is a brain hormone.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Vastly,
not a little bit,

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
like 97% of the
serotonin in your body

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:90%
is in your digestive tract.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's a digestive hormone
because the digestive system

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:90%
needs this vigilance aspect.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So SSRIs are a
recipe for disaster.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, if somebody is depressed--

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.659 align:middle line:84%
And I've done talks where
I've talked about SSRIs

00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and it being problematic.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.359 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody is depressed,
it's hard to say to them,

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:84%
don't take your Zoloft
or don't take your--

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "I'm gonna kill myself
if I don't have my Zoloft."

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So, you know, I think
everybody's number-one health

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:84%
goal should be to wean
themselves off of it.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But you can't say
that to somebody

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.932 align:middle line:84%
who's got mental health
issues and these things

00:41:17.932 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:90%
are somehow stabilizing them.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.320 align:middle line:84%
However, what you
can do is you can

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.770 align:middle line:84%
start to create other avenues to
approach the health challenge.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So for depression,
you can do movement.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to
up-regulate happy hormones

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, not
serotonin, necessarily,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.892 align:middle line:90%
but dopamine and norepinephrine.

00:41:33.892 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Norepinephrine.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So movement is a
very important thing

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.360 align:middle line:84%
if you're dealing
with depression.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Foods, of course, are
a very important thing.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.365 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your blood sugar
stable is important.

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:42.865 align:middle line:84%
There are nutrients
that you can do.

00:41:42.865 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always hesitant
to say to somebody,

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:84%
don't take your Zoloft or
don't take your Effexor.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.569 align:middle line:84%
But what I prefer
to say is, maybe

00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:84%
there's other things
that you can do,

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.967 align:middle line:84%
if you so desire,
to wean yourself

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:54.300 align:middle line:90%
off your Effexor or your Zoloft.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You covered a
little bit of the SSRI.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And now the--

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Thyroid?

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --whole thyroid, yeah.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: The thyroid thing.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.035 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing
about the thyroid, OK.

00:42:02.035 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it always amazes me
that the thyroid medicine

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.300 align:middle line:84%
is like the number
three or number four

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.133 align:middle line:90%
medicine every year.

00:42:06.133 --> 00:42:08.717 align:middle line:84%
Because every pharmacist knows
they're the most useless drugs.

00:42:08.717 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is why people
on thyroid medication

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:84%
have to keep
changing their dose.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell us why.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because you
can't control the thyroid

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.870 align:middle line:84%
without controlling
the preceding organs.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid is a secondary
system in the sense

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's reflective of what's
happening in the blood sugar

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.349 align:middle line:84%
system, specifically the stress
system, the blood sugar system,

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:90%
and the digestive system.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I call this the
triangle of disease.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:84%
There are three points
of bodily breakdown

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.757 align:middle line:84%
that underlie all
disease states.

00:42:35.757 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
digestive system, which

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about, and then
the blood sugar system, and then

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the body's stress
management system.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid is
reflective of what's

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:84%
happening at those
three levels so

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that when your cortisol, your
body's stress hormone, is high,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:84%
your body will compensate by
slowing down thyroid function.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.287 align:middle line:84%
When your blood
sugar is messed up

00:42:54.287 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and when your digestive
system is messed up,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:84%
likewise, your thyroid
will slow down.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So to try to approach the
thyroid by itself by giving

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:90%
hormones is not going to work.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem is
not at the thyroid level.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then how do you
regulate the blood sugar?

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, you want to
work with the triangle, first

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.170 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And so the triangle
means work with cortisol.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.870 align:middle line:90%

00:43:20.648 --> 00:43:21.502 align:middle line:90%
Take a hot shower.

00:43:21.502 --> 00:43:22.710 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that earlier.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.010 align:middle line:90%
If you can sit in a bath.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Simply that alone will activate
the parasympathetic nervous

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude activates the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Love activates the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.086 align:middle line:84%
Bodily relaxation activates the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:43:37.086 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Anything you do to activate the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.859 align:middle line:90%
That's step number one.

00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Step number two is you
stabilize the blood sugar.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Really, when you talk about
stabilizing the blood sugar,

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:46.225 align:middle line:84%
the most important
aspect of that

00:43:46.225 --> 00:43:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is keeping your insulin low,
keeping your insulin sharp so

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that your cells are all
responsive to insulin.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:84%
The biggest disease
on the planet

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that's behind heart
disease and behind cancer,

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:84%
which is supposedly
the first two diseases,

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is diabetes or
insulin resistance.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Not type one diabetes,
but type two diabetes,

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:05.937 align:middle line:90%
which is insulin resistance.

00:44:05.937 --> 00:44:07.561 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to
do is you want make

00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:08.720 align:middle line:90%
your insulin really strong.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So insulin regulates
the blood sugar, right?

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Insulin regulates
the blood sugar, correct.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:84%
When you eat sugar,
your insulin goes up.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the job of
insulin is to open up cells

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:84%
so sugar can get
stashed into the cells.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Then your blood sugar goes down.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And then you eat more.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280 align:middle line:90%
So your insulin goes up.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And then your blood sugar
gets, your sugar gets--

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.646 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
keep it active?

00:44:25.646 --> 00:44:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You sensitize it.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.326 align:middle line:84%
You want to make your
cells sensitive to insulin.

00:44:29.326 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:84%
You do it by keeping
your insulin down.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Did you
ever go to a concert

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.430 align:middle line:84%
where the music is really
loud and, gradually, it

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:38.800 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem as loud anymore?

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Your body adjusts to it.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It turns the volume
down on the music.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
ways the body works.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a compensatory mechanism.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.005 align:middle line:84%
So over the course
of time when insulin

00:44:47.005 --> 00:44:48.880 align:middle line:84%
is kind of going up and
down and up and down,

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this insulin present,
the cells lose their ability

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:90%
to sense insulin.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.165 align:middle line:90%
They become insulin resistant.

00:44:53.165 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So what does that tell you?

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want to resensitize
your body to insulin,

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:90%
lower your insulin.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is why fasting
is so important.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.001 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Again.

00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:02.249 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Again, again fasting.

00:45:02.249 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't want
to fast, reducing foods

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.660 align:middle line:90%
that spike your insulin.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The most important
insulin-spiking foods are

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.365 align:middle line:84%
the foods we all
love, the breads--

00:45:09.365 --> 00:45:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Carbohydrates.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --and the
grains, the carbohydrates

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and the sweets and the sugar.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.911 align:middle line:84%
And today, you can't go 30
feet without finding a source

00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:90%
of these kinds of foods.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And if you are

And you're constantly
looking for reward

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.140 align:middle line:84%

else is one of the best ways

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.530 align:middle line:84%
to resensitize
yourselves to insulin.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But in general, keeping
your carbs down.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:84%

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: They do.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Carbs are sugar.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:45:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.538 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And carbs
break down into sugar.

00:46:01.538 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But protein, the
body is very clever.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And it can efficiently,
quite efficiently

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.422 align:middle line:84%
actually, turn
protein into sugar.

00:46:08.422 --> 00:46:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating--
and a lot of people

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:84%
make this mistake
when they go paleo

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.463 align:middle line:84%
or they eat a lot of
protein, is they think,

00:46:13.463 --> 00:46:14.840 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'll just eat
a lot of steak.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And they don't lose weight.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And they can't figure out
why I'm not losing weight.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Because your body is turning
that protein into sugar,

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.940 align:middle line:90%
which ends up as fat.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is the body going

Because it can burn fat.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
ketogenic diet is.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.906 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: So it can burn fat.

00:46:28.906 --> 00:46:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And your goal is to be fat
burner, not a sugar burner.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Fat is a much cleaner, more
dense source of energy.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.323 align:middle line:84%
This is why the ketogenic diet
is so helpful and so important.

00:46:36.323 --> 00:46:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a fat-burning diet.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
encourage the body

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.474 align:middle line:84%
to get its energy from
fat as much as possible.

00:46:41.474 --> 00:46:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do that is
by keeping your carbs out

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.410 align:middle line:84%
as best as possible and
keeping your protein low.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You need protein
for other things.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So you got have some
amount of protein.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.806 align:middle line:84%
But keeping the carbs
down to a minimum.

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no real need for carbs.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You need fat and
you need protein.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's no real
need for carbs.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
go to zero carb.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Because carbs are a
good source of energy.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's
phytonutrients and things

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.020 align:middle line:90%
associated with the carbs.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second point
of the triangle of disease,

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.400 align:middle line:90%
is the blood sugar.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the third point
is the digestive system.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:90%
So you got a triangle, right?

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.531 align:middle line:84%
Digestion, which breaks down
woefully early by the way,

00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:13.790 align:middle line:84%
like in the womb or at birth
or within the first year

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of the child's life his
or her digestive system

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.180 align:middle line:90%
is breaking down.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what colic is.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Colic is the digestive system
starting to break down.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.895 align:middle line:84%
Eczema, pimples,
there's all these things

00:47:22.895 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that happen to kids
are manifestations

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of the digestive
system breaking down.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other story.

>>FUCHS: But here's
where it gets cool.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So the digestive system,
when it breaks down,

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.480 align:middle line:84%
it creates changes
in blood sugar.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes has behind it
digestive issues, by the way.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.158 align:middle line:90%

>>FUCHS: Everything does.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm telling you.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see what
you're saying.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And then
you go into cortisol.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets interesting.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So the cortisol spikes and
that will cause your thyroid

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.174 align:middle line:90%
to slow down.

00:47:46.174 --> 00:47:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
becomes interesting.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.385 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid regulates
the digestive system.

00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So when the thyroid
slows down, now you

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.140 align:middle line:84%
have even slower
digestive functioning--

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --which leads to more
blood sugar problems, which

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.130 align:middle line:90%
leads to more cortisol.

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And you get this
downward spiral.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And most people are in this
from birth until the time

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.610 align:middle line:84%
that their disease hits
at the age of 30 or 40.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.264 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
percolating underneath.

00:48:06.264 --> 00:48:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And people are like, well, I was
just sitting there watching TV,

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:84%
minding my own business, and
all of a sudden, I got cancer.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I got arthritis.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden, I
got hypothyroidism.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.229 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
got these disease states,

00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that
this triangle has

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.220 align:middle line:84%
been in effect their entire life
where the digestive system is

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.020 align:middle line:90%
broken down.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.311 align:middle line:84%
And the blood sugar system
is starting to lose control.

00:48:25.311 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're chronically
spiking cortisol.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Your thyroid is slowing down.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And this whole thing happens.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.830 align:middle line:84%
By the way, behind
all disease states,

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.959 align:middle line:84%
you'll find this
triangle of disease

00:48:35.959 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and you'll find hypothyroidism.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
a thyroid test.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to waste your
time with a thyroid test.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just go
right towards this.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: How is your
body performing?

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.540 align:middle line:84%
If your body is
underperforming in any way,

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.385 align:middle line:84%
rest assured, you've
got a thyroid problem,

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:50.510 align:middle line:90%
whether it's tested or not.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, I get it.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So this goes back to
how we heal disease.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And Ben has this great
video here talking about,

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:90%
we are not our diagnosis.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: One of the
most fundamental ideas

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.090 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that what
you're diagnosed with

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:11.820 align:middle line:10%
is not the problem in terms of
reversing your health issue.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:10%
Medical diagnoses are
conveniences that doctors

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:10%
use to explain symptomology.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.055 align:middle line:10%
And we get obsessed
with symptomology

00:49:23.055 --> 00:49:26.610 align:middle line:10%
and end up marginalizing or
being dismissive of causes.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.920 align:middle line:10%
In other words, we have
a pharmaco-medical model

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:10%
that treats symptoms
as if they were

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:10%
the diseases, that
treats symptoms

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:10%
as if those were the problems.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:10%
The symptom may be
problematic in terms

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:10%
of how you live your life.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But as far as reversing
the symptomology,

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.140 align:middle line:90%
your diagnosis doesn't matter.

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The breakdowns in the
body are always generic.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And whether it shows
up as osteoporosis

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:84%
or autoimmune disease or
skin diseases or cancer,

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.770 align:middle line:84%
you're always going
to see the same things

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.910 align:middle line:84%
underneath or behind all
the various symptomologies

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with
these different diagnoses.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
reverse the disease state,

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what the diagnosis is.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even matter
what the symptomology is.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:90%
What matters is the cause.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:10%
If you have a tree that is
producing rotten fruit or moldy

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.380 align:middle line:10%
leaves, you don't
spray the leaves.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't correct the
problem at the level

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of the fruit or the leaf.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You correct the problem
at the level of the soil.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we are
not our diagnosis,

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.920 align:middle line:90%
then how do we address illness?

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.850 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's great.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've talked
about what not to do.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.080 align:middle line:90%

>>FUCHS: Gordian
knot, Gordian knot.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.510 align:middle line:90%
You start off with food.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Eat way less food, way less.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What kind?

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.608 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You know what?

00:50:43.608 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Even before that,
listen to your body.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.467 align:middle line:84%
Understand that your body is
always communicating to you.

00:50:48.467 --> 00:50:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sleep when you're tired.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All of that.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.080 align:middle line:84%
All of that, chop
wood, carry water.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:52.996 align:middle line:90%
You know, all of that.

00:50:52.996 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Listen to your body,
the simple things.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:55.785 align:middle line:90%
Just listen to your body.

00:50:55.785 --> 00:50:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Our body is always
communicating.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, the next
time you have,

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
like Snickers bars.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.570 align:middle line:84%
That's my little
thing, a Snickers bar.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Ok.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've just had this
whole health show and you tell

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.570 align:middle line:90%

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No I don't eat them.

>>FUCHS: That's
my-- you know, that

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.123 align:middle line:84%
would be what I think

00:51:09.123 --> 00:51:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I think would think of Snickers
bars or cigarettes or soda

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.220 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
something that you

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:84%
know that you shouldn't do,
but you really want to do.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I don't

>>LISA: Yeah.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.090 align:middle line:84%

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --take the
French fry and then

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.410 align:middle line:84%
pull it out and put the

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the deliciousness and look at
that golden, crunchy yumminess

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.730 align:middle line:90%
of whatever it is that you like.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then raise it your
mouth very slowly.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you're raising
it your mouth, listen.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee, you will a
hear a voice go, "no, Lisa, no."

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Happens all the time.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.365 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It happens

00:51:43.365 --> 00:51:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course, yes.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But the
reason I know that is

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.380 align:middle line:90%
because I have that voice.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.869 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And we all
have that voice.

00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:50.535 align:middle line:84%
And that voice is
always talking to you.

00:51:50.535 --> 00:51:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell you to
turn left at the corner

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.160 align:middle line:90%
or right at the corner.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:54.803 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Everything.

00:51:54.803 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
still, small voice.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's been known about.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And this voice has
been known about.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.222 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like, you can
give it a Christian metaphor.

00:52:02.222 --> 00:52:03.180 align:middle line:90%
You can say it's Jesus.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.050 align:middle line:90%
You can say it's God.

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:05.133 align:middle line:90%
You could say it's spirit.

00:52:05.133 --> 00:52:06.530 align:middle line:90%
You could say whatever it is.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And we don't listen.

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's the one thing.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.280 align:middle line:84%
The body has a
wisdom built into it

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.042 align:middle line:90%
that it wants to share with us.

00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell us
everything we need to know.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's even before we
get into what you can do.

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Number one, listen to your body.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So then, specifically,
listen for foods.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from foods
that are problematic.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.586 align:middle line:84%
If a food makes you feel
tired, don't eat it.

00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:27.210 align:middle line:84%
If a food is associated
with-- and then

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.760 align:middle line:84%
see how you feel

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one thing

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.068 align:middle line:90%
you feel tired, don't eat it.

00:52:33.068 --> 00:52:33.902 align:middle line:90%
But at least notice.

00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:35.318 align:middle line:84%
Even before you
decide not to eat,

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.440 align:middle line:84%
at least notice that after
you eat a certain food,

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.310 align:middle line:90%
you're tired.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Or after you eat a certain
food, you get a rash.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.580 align:middle line:84%

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Or after eat a certain food,
you don't feel good in any way.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.307 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:52:47.307 --> 00:52:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Lay off the problem foods.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And eat less food.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Number two, don't
spike your blood sugar.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Try to stay with
foods that don't

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.790 align:middle line:90%
make your blood sugar go up.

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And eat foods that help
control your blood sugar

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.360 align:middle line:90%
like fiber foods.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Foods that have a
lot of fiber in them

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:03.630 align:middle line:84%
will keep your
blood sugar stable.

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from fruit
juices or foods

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that have super-high
concentrations of sugar

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:84%
without the fiber,
processed foods.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.650 align:middle line:90%

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because, you know,
I don't feel comfortable

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.150 align:middle line:84%
saying this is a good food
and this is a bad food.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you feel right for you.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.669 align:middle line:90%
But just listen.

00:53:21.669 --> 00:53:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from things
that cause your blood

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:90%
sugar to go up and down.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.204 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know blood
sugar drops by fatigue.

00:53:26.204 --> 00:53:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll know blood sugar gets
too high by jittery and anxiety.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Number three, and maybe
the most important,

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because we can do this right
away, lower your cortisol.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Do all the things you could
do to relax your body.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Number four, move your body.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Move the lymphatic system.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The body loves quick
bursts of movement followed

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.720 align:middle line:90%
by long, luscious rest.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't mind working.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.170 align:middle line:84%
We just want to
work all the time.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because the
body likes to work.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It just doesn't
want to work all the time.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't need a lot.

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It needs five
minutes of intensity.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.058 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to
exercise, by the way,

00:53:57.058 --> 00:53:59.555 align:middle line:84%
is intense exercise
for five minutes a day.

00:53:59.555 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of
cool, because then you

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.420 align:middle line:90%
have a lot more time to rest.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.548 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to stay
in the gym for an hour

00:54:03.548 --> 00:54:03.740 align:middle line:90%
or half an hour.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:04.670 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.925 align:middle line:90%
Five minutes?

00:54:04.925 --> 00:54:06.091 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Five minutes a day.

00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:84%
If you could do five minutes
a day everyday, great.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of burst exercise?

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Intense.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's exercise
because your body is saying

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.580 align:middle line:90%
we don't need to do this.

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stop.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Your body is saying we
don't need to do this.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.446 align:middle line:90%
It's not even your body.

00:54:18.446 --> 00:54:20.695 align:middle line:84%
It's your mind that's saying
we don't need to do this.

00:54:20.695 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so quick
burst of exercise.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then number four,
make sure you're

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.700 align:middle line:84%
leveraging your mental
and emotional powers.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Do not underestimate it.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Your mental and
emotional natures

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:84%
are linked to the physical
body from the hormones.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So your body is the
end result of what

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.420 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking and feeling and
the hormones you're producing.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.847 align:middle line:84%
Don't underestimate
the power of your mind

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and the power of your feelings
and the power of your emotions.

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievably important.

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, I say last, but
it's certainly not least.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the most important.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It's your spirituality.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.821 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean
your connection.

00:54:54.821 --> 00:54:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With each other?

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Every connection.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Separation is an illusion.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.440 align:middle line:10%
And it is the ultimate sin.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.870 align:middle line:10%
It is original sin.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.462 align:middle line:10%
It is this idea that we live
in a world where we're separate

00:55:04.462 --> 00:55:06.170 align:middle line:10%
and where I'm separate
from the universe.

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.711 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
fear comes from.

00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If I believe that I'm alone
and marooned in this universe

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.439 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
around me and I'm here,

00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:13.854 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
most of us believe

00:55:13.854 --> 00:55:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way
most of us think,

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I'm gonna be
in a defensive posture.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I can't help it.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.453 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I have to be
in a defensive posture.

00:55:20.453 --> 00:55:22.460 align:middle line:10%
Because the world can
come crashing down on me.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.670 align:middle line:10%
But if we believe what is really
true at the quantum level,

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.100 align:middle line:10%
and even if you use
your imagination,

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:10%
you can see that I'm being
created in your brain

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.329 align:middle line:84%
And you're being created
in my brain right now.

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a oneness
that's a place that's

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.650 align:middle line:84%
not only scientifically
valid, but also common sense

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:38.450 align:middle line:90%
tells you that.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.090 align:middle line:84%
If you could truly
live in that place,

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that will allow your
sympathetic nervous system

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to stand down, your emergency
system, your defensive system

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.780 align:middle line:90%
to stand down.

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that's
what it's all about.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It seems like it.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.533 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: In Christianity,

I say you have to be safe.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.150 align:middle line:84%

the key there,

00:56:03.486 --> 00:56:07.130 align:middle line:84%
is to really understand
the psychological aspects

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.690 align:middle line:90%
of disease and illness.

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:09.490 align:middle line:90%

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The only way to live an
effective, powerful life, which

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.440 align:middle line:84%
is what I want to do is live
a power-- is take a stand.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And not only to take
a stand for yourself,

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but if you really believe
in what you're doing,

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:33.430 align:middle line:84%
to take a stand for humanity,
to take a stand for everybody.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I find that when
I do that for myself,

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.980 align:middle line:90%
my dopamine goes up.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.040 align:middle line:90%
