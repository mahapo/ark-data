00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So how good are you
at surrendering?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a few questions.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you recognize that you
cannot control everything?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you admit that you don't
always have to be right?

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you be spontaneous?

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you enjoy life
and stop long enough

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:90%
to let a beautiful day in?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Dr. Judith Orloff.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychiatrist
and an intuition expert.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of her
newly released book called

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
"The Ecstasy of Surrender:
12 Surprising Ways

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Letting Go Can
Empower Your Life."

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.156 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. JUDITH ORLOFF:
Oh, you're welcome.

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I joke because the
therapy session begins now.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.164 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: The surrender
therapy session.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.274 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, please.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
This show is for me today
and for everyone listening

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
because how many people have
you encountered since coming out

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.166 align:middle line:84%
with the book that
have control issues?

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Hahaha.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everybody, right?

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:09.956 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:90%
What does it stem from, Judith?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, I think our
society is so control oriented

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're not taught as
children to surrender.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, the assets
of really letting go

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and not clenching and forcing.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to push the river,
make our dreams come true,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and make that
relationship happen,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and make that job happen,
and do it all on will.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
is that surrender

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
is knowing when to do that,
when to really go forward,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and when to let go and let
spirit come in to help you.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Because we're in a flow.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you're just doing
everything on self will,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
tired very quickly.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I know this.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So why is it so hard, though,
for people to surrender?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so challenging?

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.151 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, I think
in the West, people

00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
associate surrender with defeat,
with weakness, with giving up.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They look at it in a military
way, like you're giving up.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's so not what
I'm talking about.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Surrender as a devotional path
in many spiritual practices

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:90%
is common throughout the world.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just not in
Western culture.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So as I've been
touring with the book,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in particularly
mainstream media,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I really have to educate people
about what surrender means

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
scary to people

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
not to be in control
every minute.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But the good news
and the bad news

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is you can't be in control
every minute no matter what.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean,
let's talk about why

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
we want to control
in the first place.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it for safety?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah, it's to
feel safe, to feel secure.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
I can control my environment.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I can control this life, which
we really can't because we

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:90%
begin here.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We live our lives.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the ultimate surrender,
which is the last chapter,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is letting go to death
and the afterlife.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
There comes a time where
we all must surrender.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.095 align:middle line:90%
It's so inevitable in our cells.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's something that's for sure.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And we can't fight it.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And this terrifies people.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
The smaller surrenders sometimes
mimic the larger surrender

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
of actually letting
go of the body.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:90%
But that's the big one.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I mean, there
are so many things in life

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
to surrender to that
will increase your energy

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and make you more flexible,
make you more feminine,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
make you more masculine,
bring you into your true self

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
instead of this clenched, tight,
rigid person who's miserable

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you equate
surrender to little mini

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
deaths of the ego at all?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Hopefully.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The ego is a very
beautiful thing.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And the ego can help us excel
and all kinds of things,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:90%
but it's not our god.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We must be in
devotion to humility.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you're stuck
in ego, I can do it.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.891 align:middle line:90%
I'm the center of the universe.

00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You kind of miss the
point of surrender

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.319 align:middle line:84%
because you are not the
center of the universe.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But Judith, how
do you get anything done?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.318 align:middle line:84%
Not saying that you have
to be a control freak,

00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
but how do you get anything
done if you don't have goals,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
if you don't try to control
the outcome of the goals?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
How do you move
forward in a place

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.584 align:middle line:84%
and be in a place of
surrender at the same time?

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, the
ecstasy of surrender

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
and the dance of
surrender is learning

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
when to move forward and use
your ego, to use your will

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to go forward but knowing when
to stop and when to let go,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and then when to
move forward again.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a dance.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a movement.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not one thing or another.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
You learn when to
say, all right, now

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I could be the mountain and
let somebody come to me instead

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
of calling, and calling,
and pushing, and pushing.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a breath
and just sit here and wait.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Or at other times, you're
going and knocking on doors,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
or you're making calls because
it feels right intuitively.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So much about surrender is
listening to your intuition,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the still small voice
inside that will guide you,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:90%
like move forward.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Your body even feels like
moving forward versus no,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm pushing too hard.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
What I'm teaching
in the book is how

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to get to that point of knowing
when I'm pushing too hard,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's time to
hang back a little.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:90%
The pushing hard.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about your
evolution with surrender.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
You have many bestselling
books. "Second Sight"

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.020 align:middle line:84%
is a huge book for people where
you talk about your intuition

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and how to recognize so
many different things

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:90%
about intuition.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to
this place of surrender

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
where it comes to your whole
conversation around intuition

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
and being a psychologist?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, when I
wrote "Second Sight,"

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
it was a huge surrender for me
to bring it out into the world

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
because I was coming out as
a psychiatrist and a psychic

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
or slash intuitive, whatever
you want to call it,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and I was terrified of what my
medical colleagues would think.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So my surrender was
trust, turn it over.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You wrote this book
from your heart.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:90%
You wrote your experience.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the right thing to do.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Put it out in the world.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Ah, so scary.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm so afraid of what
people will think.

00:06:04.255 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So with surrender, it's not
as if you're without fear.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't
let fear dominate me.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And o the book was
put out in the world,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and it got such a tremendous
reception for many years.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even from
colleagues as well?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Some of my colleagues.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, many of my colleagues.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And especially the woman
I'm supervising now

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
was reading-- the young psych
resident I'm supervising

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:84%
was reading it when she
was undergoing chemo.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: So to me,
that's very beautiful

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that the opening happens
during a period of crisis.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And who knows when
you reach for a book.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a magical thing, isn't it?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.592 align:middle line:84%
The book might fall
out of the bookshelf.

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But my coming out, the surrender
of my fear, and coming out

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
as a psychiatrist
and an intuitive

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
has been extremely helpful for
other people and other health

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:84%
care professionals,
and extremely helpful

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
for my freedom in terms
of finding a voice.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.254 align:middle line:84%
So I had to let go of
that fear and trust

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
really beautiful about what

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.245 align:middle line:90%
I was doing and something good.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it more of an
internal struggle for you

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
because of the way
that you were raised

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
around a professional
family and really

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to go down that trajectory
of being the doctor?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah, I think
so because my mother was

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
so afraid of what people
would think of me.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Would I be considered weird?

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Would I be kicked out of
the medical profession?

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Would I be laughed at or
whatever she was afraid of?

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.303 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want me to be
considered, quote, weird.

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:90%
That was her worst fear.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as I
wrote in the book,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.294 align:middle line:84%
I've given up trying to appear
as normal because I'm not.

00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good idea.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.334 align:middle line:90%
We all should give that up.

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Give it up.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:39.425 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I've always led my own
quirky, different path,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
which I follow with
a lot of passion.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But I've never gone
the mainstream.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had a mother who
wanted me to go mainstream.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And so part of my
surrender process

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
has been letting go of
what she thinks of it.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
She's on the other side now.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Or anybody else for that matter.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So part of surrender-- and
this is hard for people,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but I teach all
my patients this--

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to surrender what
other people think of you.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And want from you.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And want from you
and think is best for you.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to follow
your intuition, what's

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.704 align:middle line:90%
best for yourself.

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, let's
talk about that,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
surrendering what other
people think of you.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, when
we're kids, we

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:90%
try to fit in out of survival.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It all starts there in school.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
How do you let go
of that idea of what

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.248 align:middle line:90%
other people think of you?

00:08:31.248 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: You have to be
very, very true to yourself.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
And you don't do it
in a hostile way,

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
but you really weigh the
positives and negatives

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of what people
say and tell them,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.851 align:middle line:84%
thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I have a strong
opinion about how you should

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.197 align:middle line:84%
dress, or how you
should lead your life,

00:08:47.197 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
or what person you should
marry-- outrageous things they

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't even comment on.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And you just look at them, and
you say thank you for sharing.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll factor that
into my decision.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And then tune in,
listen to yourself.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Is this the person that's right
for me, not my mother, not

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.136 align:middle line:84%
my father, not my
teachers, but me?

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Is this the person who's
going to nurture me,

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to have
a good relationship?

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You tune in to your
intuition, and you

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
go with that instead of the
throngs of relatives saying,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:90%
but he's not this.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And he's not that.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.629 align:middle line:90%
No, but he's right for me.

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if it's not
even a relationship.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
If it's a career
path, or a passion,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
or a hobby to go
back in and say it

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what
people think about me.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
fills my soul, right?

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
saying to do?

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Surrendering to that.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.171 align:middle line:84%
Go for what gives
you the goosebumps.

00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
As Quincy Jones said in my
book, "Positive Energy,"

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:90%
when I interviewed him.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the goosebumps.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
He says, he never
goes for projects

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
without the goosebumps,
that feeling you get.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm moving forward.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.997 align:middle line:90%
And you get a yes.

00:09:50.997 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And he's
been very successful.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And so he listens
to his intuition.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about when-- what about
surrender is so liberating?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
What is that feeling?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Just
exhale and feel how

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that surrender--
that's a surrender.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.834 align:middle line:84%
Instead of holding
your breath, you're ah.

00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Shoulders
are raised and--

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.083 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Down come the
shoulders, you know,

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:90%
out go the arms.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You're radiant.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:90%
You're moving.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
You're flowing instead
of rigid in your head

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
because unfortunately, a
lot of really smart people

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
just live up in their head.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So when they age, it's not
easy for their bodies to age

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
because they've never put
the energy into their bodies.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you
surrender as a woman,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
let's say, you surrender
to your feminine

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and you surrender
to your masculine.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%
You go back and forth.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Often, in career things with
me, I get into my masculine

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
because I have to organize
things, I have to send people--

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:90%
but that's OK.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But I don't stay in that
masculine all the time.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
do for your feminine?

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, I
have a relationship

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:84%
that nurtures that, which
is very, very helpful.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I go barefoot.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It's called earthing, bringing
the energy of the earth

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
into my feet.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I get massages.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my body.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I feel my body.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm very in touch with nature.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I dance.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I do movement.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's a conscious shift,
surrendering to your masculine.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
mode-- I find it very hard

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
to be in the
feminine mode and do

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my work, especially
organizational work.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.127 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything the feminine
in me really wants to do.

00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I just do other things
like go to the beach.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.626 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're
saying, it's OK to be

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in that place of masculine
as a female body.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for men to be in a place
of feminine as a male body.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's the balance of the two.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.025 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if you have
that experience, especially

00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
the male body, if you have
that experience of feeling

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the feminine, feeling that
receiving side, feeling that.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.581 align:middle line:84%
You can have both, no matter
what kind of body you have,

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.163 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:56.163 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all started
as X chromosomes.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.599 align:middle line:90%
So we all started as feminine.

00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yes.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.348 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: I know.

00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So-- and many men are afraid
of embracing the feminine

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:90%
in themselves.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And women often embrace
masculine a little bit easier.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.427 align:middle line:90%
But we're both.

00:12:13.427 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Society has a
whole thing around it.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.885 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah.

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's both.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Surrendering-- there's
a whole section

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
in the book on
surrendering to sexuality,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
surrendering to the
divinity of your body,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.684 align:middle line:84%
and how to live in your body and
not just live up in your head.

00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
It's when you live in your
body, you're surrendered.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean
bringing your consciousness

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
down to your body,
asking yourself

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
what does my body feel about
this person or this job?

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm always talking to my body.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, how are you in here?

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so good.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Inner dialogue.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
The body is the
divine instrument,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:90%
a divine intuitive instrument.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
really live in it.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And part of surrendering
is surrendering to the fact

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
body and nurturing

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:84%
that body with vibrant
energy as much as you can.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Yoga as we were talking,
exercise, meditation

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
brings the vital
energies into the body.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Just don't sit at
a desk and work,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and stay on your computer,
and sleep, and go home,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and wake up, and
do the same thing.

>>LISA: All over again.

00:13:16.288 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: At least keep a
yoga mat by your computer

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and just get into
some stretching

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.897 align:middle line:84%
pose, which is a
form of surrender.

00:13:22.897 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Yes, stretching is a
wonderful form of surrender.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Oh, it is.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.574 align:middle line:84%
Stretching is so beautiful,
even little stretches.

00:13:30.574 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a look

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
at a video here of
Judith's Ted Talk.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's received over a
half a million views.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
beginning of her Ted Talk.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: You know, I
have a confession to make.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I lost control, but in
the most wonderful way.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Before the sacred hours
of seeing patients,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
before writing, I just put
my arms out and danced.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
My body just moved
to Dylan's "Sad Eyed

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Lady of the Low Lands."

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Spontaneous, joyful movements.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
No arguing, no resisting,
no holding back.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I just let go.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.025 align:middle line:84%
This is the ecstasy
of surrender.

00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Today your life is going
to get better learning

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:90%
about surrender.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
As a physician and as a woman,
this is so important to me.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
It's what I want
the most in my life,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to flow with things
and not fight, and not resist,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and not hold back, and not
always over think things.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It's such a joy to
be able to flow.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Now what is surrender?

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit, surrender
is samprada, the ability

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
to give yourself wholly to
something, to flow like water,

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:90%
to not force things.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm defining it as
the grace of letting

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
go at the right
moment, of knowing how

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to let go when the time is
right without torturing yourself

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with self-doubt or
overthinking things.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:90%
How many of you overthink?

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:84%
How many of you torture
yourself with self-doubt?

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:90%
That's very common.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But surrender allows
you not to do that.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a life where
you're not doing that,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to flow
more with everything

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:90%
and have more peace in life.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:84%
That is the great
joy of surrender.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Now how surrendered are you?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a few questions.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you recognize that you
cannot control everything?

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:90%
How many of you?

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I hope you do.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
If you've tried your
best with something,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and you've given a project
let's say all of your effort,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
are you able to back off
and not torture yourself

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
with self-doubt and just give
the project some breathing

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%
room?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
able to do that?

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:90%
All right, wonderful.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you admit that
you are not right?

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to be
right all the time,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
or can you apologize,
can you compromise,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
can you let go of
the need to be right?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh good.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.465 align:middle line:90%
I see one hand.

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:27.964 align:middle line:90%
Hahaha.

00:16:27.964 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you be spontaneous
and not have

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to plan every single thing
down to the last detail?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Can you enjoy life?

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you stop long enough to let
that enjoyment in an absorb it?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what it's all about,
just letting that enjoyment in?

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
point of surrender.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
As life goes by so
quickly, you know,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:84%
you want to take advantage
of every single moment.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you have
to be able to let go.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now what stands in
the way of surrender?

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
In my life, I know this well.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's when I want
something too much,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:90%
when I'm over invested in it.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:84%
When I really want
something a lot,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
that can clog the circuits.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
And so when you want
something too much,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that's a sign you need
to just back off a little

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get
overbearing with it.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is
anxiety and fear.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
When you clench, when
you get into a fear

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
mode or an anxious mode, that
stops you from surrendering.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
What fascinates me is how
hard it is for most of us

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
to surrender.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you realize how hard it is?

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
about it, you need

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.369 align:middle line:84%
to surrender to delight
in an orgasm, don't you?

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:50.535 align:middle line:84%
If you don't surrender, not
much is going to happen.

00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Or a good night's sleep.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Every night, you need to
surrender when you go to sleep,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
otherwise you'll be tossing
and turning all night.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You need to surrender with a
good belly laugh or a good cry.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I love the healing
power of tears.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
When you hold back tears,
that's not good for your system.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And so surrendering
to tears, just

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
letting it flow, or any
emotion, such as grief

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
when you experience
loss, that is

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
when you really are
flowing with life.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what I want to say is
that we need to bring surrender

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:84%
into other aspects of our
life where the downside isn't

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
so obvious, such as
hijacking pleasure,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
because if something immediately
hijacked pleasure for you,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.835 align:middle line:84%
you would think twice
about it, hopefully.

00:18:40.835 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I want to
ask you about this part

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.232 align:middle line:84%
about pushing hard,
about pushing so hard,

00:18:45.232 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and pushing yourself so hard.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
When you've set up things around
you, and you're exhausted,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
to push, but you

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
can't stop because
of all the situations

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
you've set up around you, how
can you take that break from--

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and still fulfill
your commitments?

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
How can you surrender
to the commitments

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.929 align:middle line:84%
that you have, I
guess, is my question.

00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:08.095 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, one thing
I've noticed about myself,

00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
if I'm pushing too hard, I start
to get anxious and exhausted.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So I notice that in myself.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I get
impatient with people,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not really that
great in communicating.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So I try and catch
that in myself

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning compassionately
and say, OK, you're

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:90%
there again.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Take a little break.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take a three
minute meditation,

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
which I talk about in the
book, a three minute heart

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
meditation where it's
just time out, reset.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I need to be reset here.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Each person has to
reset themselves

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
when they get off as
quickly as possible.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:90%
So I sit.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I close my eyes.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I take a breath.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
I tune in to my heart.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I come back to my
center, and I feel spirit.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I realign myself.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Just three minutes, only
three minutes, no longer.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very time
limited meditation

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I suggest for people,
a quick tuneup.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.284 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why no longer?

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: That's not the
purpose of this meditation.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just this a quick
tuneup in a busy life.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not 45 minutes of
meditation, not a quiet time.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:90%
It's in the midst of chaos.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
When you get thrown off, how do
you come back together quickly.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, so you can
have good conversations

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and relationships and not
be so short with people.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And I
blow it because when

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
you get into that
anxious state, you know,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I know I say all
these things that I

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:90%
wish I could take back later.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very common.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm bringing it up.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then, I regret
those conversations.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:90%
I was short with that person.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have compassion
in that situation.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's three
types of surrender

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
that you talk about in the book.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:90%
The first one is crisis.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a
time of total crisis,

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
how do you surrender
in that moment?

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:90%
What are you surrendering to?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, crisis,
the Chinese ideogram,

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:90%
crisis equals opportunity.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
crisis as opportunity,

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
that's the time to surrender.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people are
forced to submit to surrender.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.045 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient who
O.D.ed on cocaine

00:21:11.045 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and ended up in
the emergency room

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
for the 10 millionth
time near death's door.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Finally, I've had enough.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:90%
I surrender.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to a 12 step program.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that moment.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we create
those for ourselves

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
so that we can hit the
bottom and have a real excuse

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:90%
to be able to surrender.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is not to
get that far, right?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.478 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: It's not
to get that far.

00:21:34.478 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, illness could
be a prompt to surrender.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The crisis of illness makes
you reevaluate everything

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
in your life, what's
important, in a second.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
When you become ill,
your reality shifts.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly,
what's important?

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Where do I want
to give my energy?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.351 align:middle line:90%
Where can't I waste it anymore.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't waste it
worrying and being in fear.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to be positive
in order to heal.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So illness is a crisis that
I've seen as a physician really

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
aligns people with--
it can align people

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
with their inner needs
and their purpose.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But as you said, you can wait
for a crisis, but I wouldn't.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's hard.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean to push yourself to that
limit is-- and I've been there.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I've been sick where I've had
to monitor every single thought

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
because the negative ones
drain the energy when

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:90%
my energy is just limited.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it definitely
puts you into that place.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is not to get
there and to listen to the signs

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
beforehand so that you
don't continue to push.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Another one is surrendering
anxiety and fear.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Oh, that's so
big just for everyone

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to make a commitment
on a daily basis

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to try and surrender
anxiety and fear,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and instead come from
the heart and trust where

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:90%
your intuition is leading you.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.664 align:middle line:90%
That's not fear or anxiety.

00:22:50.664 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Give me
an example of what

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that means, surrendering
to anxiety or fear.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
What's an example of that?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, let's say
you're after a career.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
You're really looking for
a career in, let's say,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
the fashion industry.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And you want to go
for that career,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
but you have all kinds of fear
that you're not this enough

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
or not that enough, and
so you stay in your room,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and you don't make any
calls, and you don't go out

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to oh my god,
this feels so good inside.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:90%
This is where I belong.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm scared.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make
the call anyways.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So surrendering to that
fear and diving into it, right?

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.196 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, diving into
it but not letting it stop you

00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
by saying, all
right, I'm afraid.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's afraid.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how much
fear is in everybody.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
I've walked through things.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I am so scared.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.320 align:middle line:84%
When I did that Ted Talk, I was
afraid to the very last minute.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, usually,
my fear lifts before then.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The very last
minute I was afraid

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
stand in a little circle

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.777 align:middle line:90%
when you do the Ted Talk.

00:23:47.777 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't move
out of the circle.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.264 align:middle line:84%
And it was inhibiting
my activity.

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know
if I could do it.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But the minute I got
up there, it lifted.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.169 align:middle line:90%
And I was able to--

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You looked comfortable.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah, comfortable.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I was able to-- because I
connected with the audience,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and that always aligns me, when
I'm connecting with people.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
that surrendering

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:90%
to the fear of public speaking?

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Where did you put
your attention?

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Not on myself.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in my personal self.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't think about me.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I think about the audience
and what I could give to them.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm in the flow.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm really grooving.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But if I got up when I spoke
in front of, let's say,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of people, and
I was thinking oh my god,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm up here-- I
don't think about me.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh god no.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that would be awful.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: It's surrendering
my self and my personal self

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and just feeling the ecstasy
of the flow of speaking

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and the audience that you
feel when you do your show.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just so beautiful to
be able to give up your ego

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:90%
and just be in the energy.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a surrender.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the word
ecstasy, because it is;

00:24:51.058 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:84%
it's that pure
bliss of surrender.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Of connection.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
When you can let go of your
fear even for a moment.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Just the bliss of connection,
the ecstasy of I'm with you.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:90%
And I could be with you totally.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm nowhere else.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Surrendering is
being in the now.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is the key to ecstasy
when nothing else intrudes,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
just me and you here,
doing this show,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
having fun, feeling the
ecstasy of this connection.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And then it builds.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Then you start to really feel
almost altered states from it.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I'm grateful for it.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful for our connection.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for our
female to femaleness.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it
comes out of it.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It rises out of it.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other--
another part of surrender

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:90%
is surrendering to what is.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:90%
This is what is.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.037 align:middle line:84%
Being out in nature,
surrendering to that.

00:25:42.037 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: This is all
you have, this moment.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is watching it.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
This is your moment.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:90%
This is it, the capital IT.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:90%
As Ram Dass said, be here now.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It was true.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Be here now.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the power of now.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Power of now.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Now is it.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Where it's at.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Now is it.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Now is gone now.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.512 align:middle line:90%
Now is a new now.

00:26:04.512 --> 00:26:05.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right now.

00:26:05.262 --> 00:26:05.761 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And now is now.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a new now.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: It's a new now.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is time passing
in the human realm.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make the
most of every moment.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.444 align:middle line:84%
And you could squander it
worrying and being in fear,

00:26:17.444 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
but as we said, the
minute you get sick,

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:90%
your energy is limited.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
energy to worry anymore.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling well,
you have all this energy.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose
how to use it.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.977 align:middle line:90%
You could waste it worrying.

00:26:26.977 --> 00:26:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I talk about in
the book the difference

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:90%
between concern and worry.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Now concern is just
having legitimate concerns

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:90%
about something.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Worrying is a form of
rumination and suffering.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, because
it lasts longer,

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and it's usually not founded.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.113 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Beat, beat,
beat over, over.

00:26:42.113 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Rumination circles.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Being concerned, I'm
concerned about my child

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:90%
because she doesn't feel well.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:90%
That's legitimate.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.374 align:middle line:84%
But I'm concerned
she's going to die.

00:26:50.374 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:90%
She's not going to be there.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, around and around.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Part of surrender is
working things down instead

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.189 align:middle line:84%
of the drama of
working things up.

00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.396 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: You have a choice.

00:27:01.396 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You can fuel fear, or
you can bring it down.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:90%
You can make things small.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I have a Taoist
spiritual teacher,

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
and he says make things small.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Don't make them large.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't blow them up.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Make them smaller.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.137 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So denominalizing
issues, drama, whatever it is?

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Just taking it down.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Well, drama.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just like saying, I
have been through so much

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.202 align:middle line:90%
Here's another challenge.

00:27:24.202 --> 00:27:25.451 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get through this.

00:27:25.451 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, I
can't figure it out,

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
but we'll get through it
as opposed to oh my god,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.974 align:middle line:90%
my life is over.

00:27:32.974 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I can tend
to get in the moment

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
so much that I do make
myself late a lot.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:90%
But then that causes anxiety.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's one thing about
surrendering in the moment,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
but then you also have to
stay keen to your commitments.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.117 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Well, it's both.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the reality of
time commitments.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
You could set a timer on your
phone or something like that.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to because, otherwise,
you'll never get anywhere.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And fulfill those commitments.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.059 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take another
look at the Ted Talk

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Judith Orloff gave.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular place,
she's talking about one

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.326 align:middle line:90%
of her patients.

00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: I had a patient,
Eve, who was 92 years old.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And her daughter was dying.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
When her daughter died, she
called me to be by her side

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital at Cedar Sinai.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going
down the hall,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.857 align:middle line:84%
I heard her wailing
and screaming.

00:28:25.857 --> 00:28:28.106 align:middle line:84%
The nurses came up to me,
and they were very concerned

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
with her, that she
would collapse.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
She was a little old
lady, very frail.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And she was really, really
making a lot of noise.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And in my psychiatric
training at USC and UCLA,

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I was trained to treat
patients at a kind of distance

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and certainly to
never touch them.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We were never trained
to even put a hand

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
or pat them on the back,
keep a safe distance.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But the minute I
walked into that room,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:84%
this little lady
jumped into my arms

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped her body around
mine in the fetal position

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:90%
and was wailing and crying.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:90%
And her tears were all over me.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And the newly minted
psychiatrist in me

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:90%
was in total shock.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I had to
surrender to that moment

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:90%
because it's what Eve needed.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's what was
right, you see.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so she spent
about an hour crying.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And then she detached
herself from me, basically.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And we talked.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And then that was the beginning
of her grieving process.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So I learned how important
it is to trust the moment,

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:90%
to be there with people.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It might not be
what you thought.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It might not be what you
thought, but it is what it is.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:90%
So you flow with that.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And you trust the
integrity of that.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:90%
That's trusting life.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm so passionate
about surrender

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because I learned about
it from my mother,

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how she
didn't surrender.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
At age 70, she was a family
practitioner in Beverly Hills,

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and she decided to take
her national board exams.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you
who know what this is,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:84%
it's as intense as the
bar exam is for lawyers.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It's so intense.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And she felt that she
needed to do this in order

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to keep up with the
younger doctors.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, she was about
the best healer I've ever met.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And she had a huge practice.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And she had all these
patients who loved her.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when I
was a little girl,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to go on
house calls with her.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And she even took
me to the hospital

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
when she made chicken
soup for Mick Jagger

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:90%
when I was a teenager.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So I got to meet him.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine what
a thrill that was.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to go with her
in her pink Cadillac

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:90%
up into the hills of Bel Air.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would watch
her with patients.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
She would listen
with a stethoscope.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.469 align:middle line:84%
She had a bag, the old
time family doctor.

00:30:53.469 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And she would listen
to her patients.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:90%
She was truly so gifted.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about my mother
was that a million people could

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
tell her how wonderful she
was, and she would only

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
look at her negative
points and her self-doubt.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's not unlike
a lot of people

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that you could have
so much going for you,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:84%
but yet a small percentage--
somebody says one little thing,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:90%
and you're off and running.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so she took this
exam and put herself

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:90%
through so much stress.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And 20 years before
that, she had

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
been diagnosed with a
pretty benign lymphoma.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But while she was
taking the test,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the months she took studying,
and beating herself up,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling she was
enough, the cell type

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:90%
changed to a malignant leukemia.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And although my
mother heroically

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
passed the test,
soon after, she died.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And as she was
dying, she said to me

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that she felt the
stress of the test

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
was what caused the
cell type to change.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so as her daughter, I was
really standing there helpless.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing I
could do to intervene.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I was there supporting her.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:90%
But I watched my mother do this.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was through losing
the dearest person to me

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that I gained a very hard lesson
on surrender, because I, too,

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%
am a workaholic.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:90%
I, too, have self doubts.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I can push myself.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:90%
So I am my mother's daughter.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew in order for
me to be happy and free

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and lead a beautiful life,
I needed to surrender.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I needed to learn
how to do that.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to follow in
her footsteps in that sense.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned early on what
it was like not to surrender

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and that, you know,
sometimes life

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:90%
gives you some hard lessons.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you all
learn from them.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:90%
We all have hard lessons.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:90%
I hope you learn from them.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I learned from
this, and thus, it

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
has spurred my passion in
what it means to surrender.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've talked
about being a control freak.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a weird
word to give it, freak.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there a good side
to being controlling?

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Is there a shadow side
to it and a positive sign

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:90%
to being controlling at all?

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Oh absolutely.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.258 align:middle line:84%
I mean in some situations,
you want to be in control.

00:33:15.258 --> 00:33:17.410 align:middle line:84%
When you're a parent, you
need to be in control.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
You can't let your
child run you.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to be the
one who's in control.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're leading a business,
you have to be a leader.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in control
at the same time yielding

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:90%
It's balance.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:84%
A control freak never
lets anybody do anything.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:90%
They never delegate.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:84%
They want to do
everything themselves.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it right.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a way
to run a business,

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:84%
or a corporation, or
anything because people

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:90%
want to feel valued.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.774 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not allowing
people to do their creativity,

00:33:44.774 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
control everything,

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.500 align:middle line:90%
you're stifling them.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's good to control
certain things in terms of you

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:90%
want to go to college.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:90%
You want to study.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I had to control a lot going
through medical school,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:90%
my psychiatric residency.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I had to really control
my mind and study,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
study, study all the time
and get a lot of sleep.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I worked with
patients, and I was on call

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.690 align:middle line:84%
every third night
for many, many years.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You really are in control
in those situations.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Patients come to you in
life and death emergencies.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
So it's good for
me to be in control

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:20.589 align:middle line:84%
and know what to do and
know what to prescribe

00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:90%
or what tests to order.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.047 align:middle line:90%
I had to be.

00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And being as empathic
and intuitive as you are,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
was that challenging
for you, where

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle line:84%
you would see people come
with mental illness or demons

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Was it hard for you to
monitor your intuition

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.942 align:middle line:90%
during those times?

00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, you know,
it was so interesting

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
because in those
times of crisis,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of my personal self,
and I'm into a selfless mode.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm not
in my personal self,

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:84%
I don't get drained as much
until afterwards just sheer

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.810 align:middle line:90%
not sleeping.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody is in front
of me with an emergency,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I go out of my personal
self, and I just

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:84%
click into intuitive
knowing, quick, fast.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's the
advantage of my being

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive psychiatrist is
that somebody can come to me,

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and I bam, bam, bam.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I get pretty much
the story quickly.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.117 align:middle line:84%
I don't wait weeks and
weeks to figure it out.

00:35:16.117 --> 00:35:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can intuit that and then
help somebody faster, and not

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.320 align:middle line:90%
prolong a problem.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.861 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: The misery.

00:35:23.861 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you still see patients?

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: I do.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have a long-- a
long waiting list of patients?

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Oh yeah, usually.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.272 align:middle line:84%
But I find that people find
me who need to find me.

00:35:36.272 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, that's a good
way of looking at it.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, so there's 12
different types of ways

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that letting go can
help in surrender.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go through
some of these, which I found.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So how can you surrender in a--
it says letting go of power.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Letting go of power.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you surrender
in that place,

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
how do you surrender and
be in a place of power

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:00.660 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.732 align:middle line:90%
You can't, can you?

00:36:01.732 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, what I'm
talking about-- in the book,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.314 align:middle line:84%
I go through
different surrenders

00:36:05.314 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:90%
in different chapters.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And one is surrender your
old views about power.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is the
egocentric view and the greed

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
view of power, or I need
to control everybody,

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
the corporate view, the
old paradigm view of power.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm suggesting
is to surrender that

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and to come into a more heart
centered view of power, which

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is really more the
soft forms of power

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
versus the hard
forms of power, which

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.530 align:middle line:84%
are adrenaline and
testosterone ruling the world.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is
another view of power?

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Another view of
power is to look at true power.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What makes a truly
powerful person?

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it the amount
of money they have?

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it whatever they
have on the outside?

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in terms of worldly power,
but if you equate happiness

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
with power, it's a bit
of a different thing.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And love.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And love,
and heart centered,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and giving back to
the world, and being

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.090 align:middle line:84%
conscious of the
Earth, and being

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
devoted to your inner
work and your inner life.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:90%
That makes people happy.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I talk about in the book
the happiness set point.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the basic level of
happiness we feel in our lives.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's been proven that
if you win the lottery,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll get happier for
a little period of time,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.510 align:middle line:84%
but you'll go back to your same
level of misery you had before.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But what will change
the happiness set

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:84%
point is if you meditate,
if you come from your heart,

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
if you do good,
if you surrender,

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:90%
then you get happier.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The happiness set point changes,
and you're happier more often.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's the goal.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Why be king of the world
if you're not happy?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.339 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's happened
too many times.

00:37:46.339 --> 00:37:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: But what's the point?

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with so many people,
corporate executives, studio

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:84%
heads who've had
these huge jobs.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they age,
and the job is gone.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And they wonder why their wives
don't have passion for them

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:90%
or where their friends are.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And so at any point, people
could start a spiritual path,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:90%
at any point.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just harder when you're 70.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:90%
But any age, it's possible.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And I support people at any age
beginning their spiritual path.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you also talk
about redefining success

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
along these same
lines of surrendering

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to a new definition of success.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example,
retiring and moving

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:90%
into a different level of life.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you suggest
to someone retiring

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:90%
to a new definition of success?

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, success is
your level of happiness.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And your level of fulfillment
and connection with yourself

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:90%
is the inner surrender.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It's surrendering to
what's inside of you.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So much of part of
the spiritual path

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
is about going inside,
feeling yourself,

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and not fighting yourself,
feeling your soul

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and surrendering to
your soul's mission,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:84%
whether it's retiring or running
a corporation or being in love

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
or not being in love or
whatever you're doing,

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:90%
surrender to your inner self.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Surrender to you
because that's who

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.170 align:middle line:84%
goes with you when you
leave this wherever.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's talk
about relationships.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Surrendering to the-- you
mention obsessive relationships

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
where people are
unavailable emotionally.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Not surrendering to those
but surrendering to-- yeah,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I caught myself
there-- surrendering

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
to no longer being in
those relationships.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.262 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:39:32.262 --> 00:39:33.886 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: There's a
chapter in the book

00:39:33.886 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
on surrendering to soul
mates, and finding soul mates,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and finding healthy
relationships.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And part of that-- and so many
patients come to me saying I

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:90%
want my soul mate.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
good men out there.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no good women
out there, whatever

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that is, that statement is and
that mass belief that that's

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And my work with
them and in the book,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
how to surrender patterns
that keep you from love.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the patterns
is being attracted

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:90%
to unavailable men or women.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big pattern.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Big pattern.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Popular pattern.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Popular pattern.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does
that stem from?

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: It usually
stems from having

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:84%
a father who wasn't
available or a mother who

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
was too suffocating, so you
wanted to get away from her.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
gets close to you,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
you start freaking out because
there's too much closeness,

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and you associate
it with suffocation.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So part of the work
is realizing you

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.807 align:middle line:84%
can't find a mate who's
unavailable, transform them,

00:40:30.807 --> 00:40:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and that will heal your initial
relationship with your father.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work, though
people try it all the time.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They think if only--
I found this guy.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
He's not available.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But if only I could change him,
I could get him to love me,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:84%
then somehow the inner
psyche thinks, oh, then

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll heal the pattern
from my father.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And as much as that may
make sense to people,

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.876 align:middle line:90%
it never works.

00:40:51.876 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that's why
there are so many affairs where

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.860 align:middle line:84%
women go after unavailable
men that are married

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:84%
or men go after unavailable
women who are married.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this
stems from that?

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, maybe if
they're looking for connection

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:90%
with that person.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but I think so many
people are commitment phobic

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.100 align:middle line:84%
because of what's
happened to them early on.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of suffocation.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I
talk about empaths.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And empaths are people who
are very open and sensitive,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
like emotional sponges, but they
take on the stress of others.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about what is
a relationship empath.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And a relationship
empath is somebody

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
who takes on the
stress of their spouse,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
so then they avoid relationships
because they feel engulfed

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.330 align:middle line:84%
by being too close
in relationships.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so for empaths--
and I'm an empath--

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I always have to negotiate
my square footage needs

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.390 align:middle line:84%
with people so they're not
on top of me all the time.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.664 align:middle line:90%
And it's a balance.

00:41:47.664 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It's really a balance.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well
because you probably

00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:84%
feel into them so much more than
if they just give you an inch,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.596 align:middle line:90%
you see the mile.

00:41:54.596 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.027 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:56.027 --> 00:41:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
All right, so another
one is-- let's talk

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:84%
about surrendering
to sexual power.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well, part of
our energy field is sexual.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:84%
The first and second chakras,
which is around the genitals

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and down in the mid abdomen.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so surrendering to that--
first of all, living in that,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.510 align:middle line:84%
not just living from the
neck up, but living down here

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and feeling what's going
on in your genitals,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and your feminine, your
masculine, all of that,

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that's a form of connecting to
the full power of your energy

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
field, which goes from
the sexual areas way up

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the head,
the white light connection.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's integrating it all,
whether you have a partner

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's
also-- that sexual energy,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that sexual power center is
where you birth things, too.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You can birth ideas and
birth passions for something.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
energy that comes

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.467 align:middle line:84%
from-- isn't that what
the kundalini energy is?

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:50.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It's that creative
power, essentially.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes, exactly.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a meditation
I have in the book.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
orgasmic meditation

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.030 align:middle line:84%
where I suggest that
people have an orgasm

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and then meditate
immediately afterwards.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Just sit up in bed, and
get quiet, and meditate,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and bring that energy up.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And it goes whoosh up
to the top of the head.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the rush
of the kundalini.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And then sit in meditation
15 minutes, 30 minutes,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:90%
or however long it goes.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.366 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel nurtured
by that sexual energy

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:90%
throughout your body.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a wonderful
way of receiving--

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.564 align:middle line:90%
that's a wonderful way.

00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what surrendering

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
does to the brain,
the brain chemistry.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:29.747 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:43:29.747 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Well,
surrendering is so beautiful

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because it gets the
endorphins going.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the endorphins are
the natural painkillers

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and the blissful neurochemicals
that make you feel ecstasy.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The ecstasy of surrender comes
from, in part, the endorphins.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's through meditation,
through laughter, through sex,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:90%
through exercise.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:84%
You get endorphins
being in nature

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and really absorbing nature.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The endorphins start flowing
in your brain and your body,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.039 align:middle line:90%
making you feel good.

00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's an
example of surrender.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It has a literal
chemical waterfall

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.020 align:middle line:90%
that happens of happy hormones.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Happy hormones.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.147 align:middle line:90%
And you can create them.

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Just by surrendering,
you can start that.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Absolutely.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You let go.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:84%
If everyone listening here
just lets go, take a breath,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.350 align:middle line:90%
drink your water very slowly.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Just sit and feel
pleasure in your body.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Then the endorphins wake up and
start going through your body.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- notice
how you feel.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Created a domino
effect in the body.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And that's
what you want.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But people don't realize
they're in charge of that.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And you could practice by being
in fear, just practice being

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in fear.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Just get all your
fearful thoughts up,

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.822 align:middle line:90%
see how you feel with all that.

00:44:43.822 --> 00:44:44.613 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Contracted.

00:44:44.613 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yes,
contracted, tense.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You could work yourself up, or
you can do it the other way.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's your choice.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
other techniques

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that you mention like
drinking the water slowly

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that can instigate somebody
going into surrender that

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
could-- little, teeny things
that could really start someone

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:84%
from unlocking themselves
from control to surrender?

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yes, just the
breath for one thing.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Just exhale, everyone listening.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Instead of clenching, just ah.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And you feel your
abdominal muscles release.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:90%
You feel energy going.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And your whole body, just relax.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And also put your
hand on your heart,

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.400 align:middle line:84%
which is the heart
chakra, right here.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And begin to picture something
very loving or beautiful

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:84%
such as the waterfall or
beautiful feathers or dancing.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Laughter.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Laughter.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And just get that pumping.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Get that energy pumping
from your heart.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:38.804 align:middle line:90%
You can move your energy.

00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And I work with all
my patients this way

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to teach them how to move the
heart energy because if you're

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:84%
having an anxiety attack
or you're starting

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to get stressed, you have
to bring it down quickly.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.895 align:middle line:90%
And this is the soothing energy.

00:45:49.895 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the healing
energy in the heart.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
become used to that,

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:90%
the more you can surrender.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Or just take a big stretch.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
One thing I suggest is
have everyone look up.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at the sky.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Notice your place
in the universe.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll be filled
with awe and wonder.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.554 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of surrender
is to get in touch with that.

00:46:12.554 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And then let go to it.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Just look up.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Don't keep looking
horizontal or down.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:84%
In the night sky with
the various eclipses

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we've been having, the blood
moon you know, just stay up

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and watch it.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Those are fun.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we did that.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
surrendering to aging.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.295 align:middle line:84%
That's a part of the
twelve ways of letting go.

00:46:32.295 --> 00:46:34.610 align:middle line:84%
How can you-- how
do you surrender

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:90%
to that aging process?

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah,
that's hard, isn't it?

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Things
change in the body,

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and things start to shrivel up.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yeah, and then
you leave your body.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But leaving the body is
different than aging.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But Ram Dass talks about
that, a beautiful way

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of talking about surrendering
during aging where you see

00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
yourself more as a soul than an
ego, when you begin to identify

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.300 align:middle line:84%
with your true
essence and your soul.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And you feel that primarily.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I talk
about spiritual aging.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only-- it
gets better with age.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The more you are devoted
to your spiritual path,

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:84%
the more you connect, the older
you get, the better it gets.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The wiser
you get, absolutely.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But is there a difference
between being wiser

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.580 align:middle line:90%
and surrendering?

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Not necessarily wiser.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It is wiser, but it's more
connected to the mysteries

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and to
your soul and to spirit.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And the more you can feel
that radiance of spirit

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:90%
as you develop energetically.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Physical aging is one thing.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's certainly
a number of things

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you can do to help
with physical aging.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And I go through everything
from bioidentical hormones

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.410 align:middle line:84%
to supplements and other
things that can really

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:84%
help physical
aging-- and exercise.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:84%
There are very
conscious things you

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.550 align:middle line:84%
can do so you could be
as youthful as possible

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and feel as good as possible
on the physical level.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's also spiritual
aging and surrendering

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to the power that comes
from that, and the radiance

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
with the universe.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Aging is about expanded
connections and development.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And then also emotional aging.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.680 align:middle line:90%
You could age well or not well.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And surrendering to, let's
say, letting go of fear.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.025 align:middle line:84%
And then as you age, fear
becomes less and less.

00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, imagine that.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.816 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it does.

00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It denominalizes as you go
along because you realize

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.165 align:middle line:84%
those things that you were
afraid of haven't happened

00:48:33.165 --> 00:48:34.030 align:middle line:90%
to this point.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And if they do, oh well.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: I just want to
say, I'm so much better

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.700 align:middle line:84%
now at this age than
I was 20 years ago.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yeah, we all are.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It does make us
wiser, but also you

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.840 align:middle line:84%
don't care as much about
the little teeny things.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.750 align:middle line:84%
You realize that moment will
pass and that moment will pass.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.274 align:middle line:90%
And it just does.

00:48:55.274 --> 00:48:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And you
go towards love.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Let that be your
guiding light is love,

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and love in yourself,
love in other people.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And love feeds you
in all situations.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about death?

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:84%
What about
surrendering to death?

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Well, it's inevitable.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.185 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: And as an
intuitive, I guess

00:49:19.185 --> 00:49:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I have an advantage in a way
where I've been able to tune

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.640 align:middle line:84%
in to death and know that
it's nothing to fear.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've known that since
I've been a little girl.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.910 align:middle line:90%
So I've always--

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Our spirits
will become more radiant,

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be more yourselves
in so many ways you can't even

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.050 align:middle line:90%
envision it.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're so connected
to this body.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I love this package
I've been given.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
give it up either,

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.980 align:middle line:90%
but this is time limited.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to enjoy
it while I have it.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But I once went to a medium
in the UK, and she said to me,

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.700 align:middle line:84%
you have more friends on the
other side than you do here.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're excited
to get there, right?

00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: No.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
mean, not excited,

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:84%
but when you get
there, it's not going

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.190 align:middle line:84%
to be the end of-- it's not
going to be as devastating.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: It's not going
to be devastating at all.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what's so
mind blowing about it.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be devastating.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not about devastation.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The loss that people go
through here when you go,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.310 align:middle line:84%
it will be devastating
for them to lose you.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's different than
you going to the other side.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A friend of mine just
lost his mother to cancer,

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:middle line:84%
but he had the privilege
of spending her last two

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:90%
weeks of life with her.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And he sat by her bedside
for two solid weeks, day,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.340 align:middle line:90%
night, day, night.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into such a
beautiful experience for him

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.960 align:middle line:90%
to watch his mother surrender.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that has got
to be such a challenging thing

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:48.550 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking with
him during the process.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But he was so-- he looks
at her as such a hero

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:59.310 align:middle line:84%
because she approached
death-- at the beginning,

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.820 align:middle line:90%
it was extremely hard for her.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But then to eventually
surrender to the process

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.070 align:middle line:84%
became a blissful
experience for both of them.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
That's so, so beautiful to be
able to be with your parents

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:90%
to help them surrender.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I also had that with both
my mother and my father,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and I helped them
surrender the physical body

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and go to the other side.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely powerful.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a letting go-- you
know, especially my mother,

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:30.140 align:middle line:84%
the wrenching feeling of losing
the physical form of my mother.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it
in "Second Sight."

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:35.490 align:middle line:84%
It was very hard for me
at the time-- as a woman,

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I was so connected
to my mother--

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.120 align:middle line:90%
letting the physical form go.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have a
relationship with her now?

00:51:42.505 --> 00:51:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: I do.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And my father actually is
closer to me than my mother.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.060 align:middle line:84%
My mother I think has
gone on to other things

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
more than my father
has made a commitment

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.325 align:middle line:84%
to stay with me
until I pass over.

00:51:53.325 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.080 align:middle line:84%
That experience
is-- when somebody's

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.009 align:middle line:84%
taken from you suddenly,
it's a lot harder.

00:52:01.009 --> 00:52:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Oh, that's different.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.060 align:middle line:84%
That's much different because
you don't have time to prepare.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it seems
unjust, especially a child.

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And life isn't fair.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not always about fairness.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:19.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you really
surrender to that kind of pain?

00:52:19.545 --> 00:52:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: You know, the heart is
stretched in so many ways that

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:84%
cause us to surrender in so
many ways we think we can't.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And that aren't-- it's not fair
to ask us to surrender in those

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.010 align:middle line:84%
ways, and yet we're
asked to do it.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:90%
We're faced with the impossible.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So you have a choice.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could either not
surrender and stay stuck in it,

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or try, try, try to find
something larger to open up

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.400 align:middle line:90%
to to carry you through.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.385 align:middle line:84%
Like what many mothers
do in that position,

00:52:47.385 --> 00:52:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
surrender, is to help

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.970 align:middle line:84%
other mothers who have
lost their children.

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So they turn their grief
into helping others.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.296 align:middle line:90%
And that's no easy thing.

00:52:57.296 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:90%
None of this is easy.

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And surrenders
sometimes are-- you

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:84%
don't know any way
you're going to do it.

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's
what's asked of you.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you either
do it or you don't.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.844 align:middle line:90%
And if you don't, you'll suffer.

00:53:09.844 --> 00:53:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I heard on
the news this morning

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:14.130 align:middle line:90%
of a woman who lost her son.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
son's name was BJ.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And he-- she took
his ashes and gave it

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to individual people that were
going to fulfill his dreams.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So he always had this dream,
I guess, to go to space.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
situation where--

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it happened, but it

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:36.510 align:middle line:84%
was on the news about a rocket
that took his ashes into space

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and not release
them, but you know,

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.690 align:middle line:84%
she was fulfilling or helping
him fulfill his dreams

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.090 align:middle line:90%
through-- that was her process.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazing story.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
stories like that.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely a process.

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no easy
answer for that one.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: There's no
easy answer except part

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.150 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
ecstasy of surrender

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is knowing that our stay
here is time limited,

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.820 align:middle line:84%
therefore we must
enjoy every moment.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And there will come a time
when everyone listening

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to this show, including
us, will be gone.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's just how it is.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can fight it, or you
can try and flow with the fact

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that your spirit is
real and powerful,

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and it's not going anywhere.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And your body is temporary,
as much as your ego might

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:24.435 align:middle line:84%
get so upset at that idea,
from an intuitive standpoint--

00:54:24.435 --> 00:54:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm asking
people to surrender

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to their intuition.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.710 align:middle line:84%
From an intuitive
standpoint, you

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:33.520 align:middle line:84%
can get a yes on
I'm going to be OK.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:84%
When you really go
deep in yourself,

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and you tune in to it.

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:38.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a meditation
in the book that I

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:40.770 align:middle line:84%
suggest for everyone
going through this that's

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:84%
questioning on
experiencing death.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And I take people
into the death space

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and how to surrender to
that very slowly so you

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:84%
can get an intuitive
sense of what it is.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And our society has made
such a big deal out of it.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to do the
meditation in the book,

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.890 align:middle line:84%
you can do it slowly where you
picture death eight feet away,

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:08.270 align:middle line:84%
seven feet away, six feet, then
slowly, then, merging with it

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and feeling-- you're
not going to die.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
People always think they will,
but it doesn't work that way.

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.276 align:middle line:90%
It's just an energy.

00:55:15.276 --> 00:55:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It's there from
the moment you're

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.920 align:middle line:90%
born to the moment you die.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Death is a very creative
energy, so much so it helps you

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.570 align:middle line:84%
with your transition
to the other side.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting
to not be as painful.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.430 align:middle line:84%
There are certain cultures
that the minute you're born,

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:30.690 align:middle line:90%
you start talking about death.

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of
life, as part of life.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: We're death
phobic in this society.

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But surrender-- that's
the final surrender.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
we have lots

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of years to practice
other forms of surrender

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and feel the release, because
you want to feel the release.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:48.562 align:middle line:84%
And especially,
if you're going--

00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:51.520 align:middle line:84%
you're ending a relationship,
and you're going through grief,

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.875 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have to
release the person,

00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, no matter how
heartbroken you are.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.170 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I adore you.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work out.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.395 align:middle line:90%
I release you.

00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And then say that
mantra over and over

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.450 align:middle line:84%
so that you can go
on with your life.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to surrender
to your future and your present

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and not stay stuck in what
didn't work, no matter

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.110 align:middle line:90%
how unfair that was.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even in the
situation of a divorce?

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.352 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Anything.

00:56:22.352 --> 00:56:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, anything.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful advice.

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Love is number one.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:28.650 align:middle line:84%
You move towards love
and towards the heart

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.230 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much
you've been hurt.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And is that a big undertaking?

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I'd say yes, but that's
what this is all about.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
do it, but if you really

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.400 align:middle line:84%
want to expand and
feel the ecstasy,

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.930 align:middle line:90%
this is a door into it.

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A good way to do it.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
a clip that-- a piece of video

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.080 align:middle line:90%
that you interviewed Ram Dass.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.760 align:middle line:90%
And talk about surrendering.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass had a stroke
several years ago.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And his-- the way that
he talks, there's long

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.590 align:middle line:84%
pauses between the
times that he talks,

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
but they're so
filled with energy.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:15.995 align:middle line:84%
>>RAM DASS: In the
West-- in the West,

00:57:15.995 --> 00:57:19.710 align:middle line:84%
they shy away from
the word surrender

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because it means you
surrender to somebody.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:27.205 align:middle line:90%


00:57:27.205 --> 00:57:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I say, I'm
surrendering to Maharaj Ji,

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.614 align:middle line:90%
the Maharaj Ji is in my heart.

00:57:37.614 --> 00:57:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm surrendering to my
intuition, my wisdom.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom that I've gathered
subjectively, not objectively.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was
that interview like

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:22.970 align:middle line:84%
for you to sit with Ram Dass
and those beautiful pauses

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that he has between
his teachings?

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.666 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: Yes, well actually,
he was interviewing me.

00:58:27.666 --> 00:58:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He was?

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.095 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:58:29.095 --> 00:58:29.678 align:middle line:90%
>>ORLOFF: Yes.

00:58:29.678 --> 00:58:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I flew out to Maui to his home.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.025 align:middle line:84%
He invited me there to be part
of a webcast to his community.

00:58:35.025 --> 00:58:36.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:58:36.025 --> 00:58:38.070 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful.

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLOFF: So it was probably
my most favorite interview

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:45.330 align:middle line:84%
in my entire life because
he gives off so much love,

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and he's not that verbal.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So it was about nonverbally
communicating with him.

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite of
the soundbite culture.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It was flowing with
the love and the energy

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and the brilliance
and his-- I kept

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.190 align:middle line:84%
wanting to hug him
the whole time.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful interview.

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:04.600 align:middle line:90%
I was so happy.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking out
onto the coast in Maui.

00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And we had a circle of
nice people around us

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:10.780 align:middle line:90%
who were beaming love.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.082 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a wonderful
experience for me.

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Talk about surrender.

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Surrendering to love.

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for surrendering with me

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and helping me learn
about surrender.

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.720 align:middle line:90%
