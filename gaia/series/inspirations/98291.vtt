00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:10.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:84%
John Gray is the author
of 25 bestselling books,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
including "Men Are
from Mars, Women

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Are from Venus," the
number-one bestselling

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:84%
book of the last decade and the
number one relationship book

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of all time, with over
50 million books sold

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
in 50 different languages.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
In all of his years
working with relationships,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
the main thing that
John noticed is

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
if people are not healthy in
their minds and their body,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and if they feel sick
and tired and exhausted,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
then their relationships
aren't going to be happy.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So he's joining us today to
talk about his new book, called

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
"Staying Focused
in a Hyper World,"

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
which we are definitely in.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's filled with cutting-age
science that supports

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:90%
mental and emotional health.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So I just said "cutting-age,"
which was just great

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:90%
because that's a whole new term.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN GRAY: It's a new term.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And you invented it.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It's just a new
age-- cutting edge-- cutting

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
edge of the new age.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.583 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cutting-age.

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:10.178 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
that's what happens

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.449 align:middle line:90%
when you start to get healthy.

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: That's true, too.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
that toxicity ages

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
us so quickly--
toxicity in terms

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals and thoughts.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
in terms of relationships.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, that's what I
saw in my own relationship

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:90%
when I turned 50.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been married to
my wife for 30 years.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And so we're
in our 60s now.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.672 align:middle line:84%
But when I turned
50, the passion

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:36.755 align:middle line:90%
was starting to disappear.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, teaching
about these ideas-- helping

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.612 align:middle line:90%
my clients with these ideas.

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, what happened?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is I wasn't
taking care of my brain.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:90%
As many of us-- we think we are.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I eat well.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I do well.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I exercise.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, you do.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: All that stuff.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And then suddenly--

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've been
talking about it for years.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Right, right.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So it has been a
part of my life.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
But something was missing.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I found out what was
missing, it was a revelation.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
The last 15 years of my
marriage have been like heaven.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It was heaven before, but
it was hard work heaven.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And I learned
a lot of lessons.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was
intentional heaven.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And I got a
lot of books out of it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that explained how to
correctly interpret women,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
how to correctly interpret
men so you don't get so upset.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But it was still an effort
to put forth all of that.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my brain
aligned with my body and health

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and vibrancy and focus, which
is a focus of my new book, then

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:90%
suddenly it became easy.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And some people
might say, oh John,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:90%
you're just older and wiser.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
But I have more energy now.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I have more presence.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:90%
My wife notices a difference.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And we saw I made a
few significant changes

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to my health, and it made
a world of difference

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.807 align:middle line:90%
in my relationship.

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I talk about now.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do men
tend to get more

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
diffused in their awareness
as they get older?

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I think you had
mentioned this to me.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.049 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, there is a
different aging for men

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and women, without a doubt.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.096 align:middle line:84%
And in relationships, you can
see a relationship has an age.

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through
stages, as well.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Men start out focused,
passionate, interested.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Women are responsive.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.372 align:middle line:90%
He can do no wrong.

00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we go
through these stages

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.164 align:middle line:84%
where he gradually
loses interest in that.

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
There's just not the
natural motivation.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean he
doesn't love her.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just he doesn't
have the focus on her.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.435 align:middle line:84%
Life pulls new
directions, and I had

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
was different there.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now women, on the
other hand, they

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
tend to become overwhelmed
by the needs of everybody.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:90%
And they get stressed out.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They're being pulled in
different directions.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And then they expect
more from him,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
like he's supposed to
solve that problem for her.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can we just go back
to the cave for a second?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
In the cave days, men
didn't-- they were programmed,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and women were
programmed for survival.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't stick with
the same woman forever.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.752 align:middle line:84%
They would go on to
procreate to the next woman.

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, now, that's
a big debate because we now

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
have all this evolutionary
psychology and brain science

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, violence is
a part of men, as well.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Now, I've
never hurt anybody.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:90%
So I have a violent part of me.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.052 align:middle line:84%
But I have a front
part of my brain, which

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:03.135 align:middle line:84%
has developed over thousands
of years of evolution

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that says, take that
violence, turn it

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
into constructive passion, and
make a difference in the world.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.479 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with sex drive.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:90%
We have this sex drive in here.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
In a guy-- I mean, we make
enough sperm to plant babies

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Women make one egg.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.111 align:middle line:84%
But men, we're ready to
look to the next to the next

00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Evolutionary, yeah.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So if I just had
this part of the brain--

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.333 align:middle line:84%
the back part of the brain,
which rules that part of me--

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
then I would want to have one
relationship after another.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I still would like to
have that if I was just

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:90%
this part of the brain.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm a whole person.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I have an emotional
part of my brain,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
which is wanting
intimacy and love

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.757 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to grow in love.

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have a front part
of my brain that says, OK,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
what's the best
strategy to do that

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.812 align:middle line:84%
and to direct that
passion in a way that

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:90%
can sustain the passion?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And that takes
relationship skills.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I've written lots of books
on those relationship skills.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But even with that
information, what I found

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
is that passion
started to disappear

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because I was missing nutrition,
and my body had become toxic.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And no fault of my own because
I was eating good foods.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't realize
today is breathing the air,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
drinking the water, driving in
a car, going in an airplane,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
eating out at restaurants-- you
are filling up with toxicity.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.776 align:middle line:90%
And I'm super healthy.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine these
other people that

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
don't eat organic
foods, and they

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
can't get meats and
chicken and whatever

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
that's free of hormones.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.522 align:middle line:84%
They're putting all these
things into their body.

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:21.771 align:middle line:84%
And then when they get sick,
then they go to a doctor.

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And that doctor
gives us antibiotics,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
which kill the good
bacteria in their gut, which

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
now leads to dementia and
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
and ADHD.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
We see it in our society.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
If you go down to South
America to indigenous tribes,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
as people get older,
they're revered.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.914 align:middle line:90%
They're smart.

00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:39.871 align:middle line:90%
They have great memory.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:90%
They have wisdom.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:90%
They have presence of mind.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:90%
They don't have Parkinson's.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't have Alzheimer's.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't have dementia in
these traditional societies.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:90%
What is different?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
What is different is
the food and the air

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.738 align:middle line:84%
and the water that we're
putting in our bodies.

00:05:52.738 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it's all farmed
and planted and harvested.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in packages
in supermarkets,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
which was basically how most of
the world lives at this point.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
get back to farm.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But with that said,
there's also air pollution

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and environmental pollution
and thought pollution.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get
our brains aligned

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
so that our relationships
do work again,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:90%
so that we're not falling prey?

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And does it change
every 15 years?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.812 align:middle line:84%
Does the body adapt
to a certain regime?

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Like you, maybe, have
been talking about health

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
for so long.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So you had a certain regime
that you were a part of.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.575 align:middle line:84%
And now you had to
morph it a little bit.

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:30.335 align:middle line:90%
Did you?

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:32.574 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, I've been
continuing to morph it.

00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
As you get older, you
need a little extra help

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%
to keep everything sharp.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
For me to explain this, to go
a little bit back in time would

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
be helpful, which
is when I turned 50,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed
with Parkinson's.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Now I have no Parkinson's now.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:90%
But that was 15 years ago.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, my head
involuntarily shaking.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And I go, how did this happen?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:90%
So I then traced it back.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I found out how it
happened for me.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It can happen in different
ways for different people.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.909 align:middle line:84%
And then I found a
natural solution.

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And in one year, my
Parkinson's was gone.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've helped now
hundreds of people.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But the real big
thing about this

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is not only helping
that mental condition.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
The same condition that gives
rise to Parkinson's gives

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
rise to ADHD in one out
of five children today.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
A more severe case of that
one condition in the brain

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
gives rise to 1
out of 50 children

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
being autistic
spectrum disorder.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And in California,
1 out of 20 boys

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
now-- last year-- autistic
spectrum disorder.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.042 align:middle line:84%
This is off the chart,
unbelievable, catastrophic.

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my God, why?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: This is
just 30 years ago,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
we had 1 out of 10,000 children
having autistic spectrum

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there was
some ADHD here and there,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
but nothing like it is now.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me, they say,
do you think this ADHD is real?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, are you
asking should we be giving

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.061 align:middle line:90%
6-year-olds methamphetamines?

00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We should not be
giving children drugs.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good thing.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Then well, is it real?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very real.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
One out of six children have
learning disorders today.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it
caught more these days,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
or is it actually a
rise in the situation?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.454 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Both.

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's both, OK.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But it's a much bigger
problem than it's ever been.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, I
had ADHD and didn't know it.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's my ADHD that
also is associated

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:90%
with very successful people.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So just because you
have ADHD doesn't

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
mean you're going to
not be successful.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I, fortunately, had
tremendous support.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So I could've become a drug
addict back in the '60s.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, the
Beatles went to India

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:90%
and learned meditation.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you went with them.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.113 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So I wanted to
meet the Beatles, actually.

00:08:37.113 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up
with the Maharishi.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
They left, and I became
his personal assistant

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:90%
for nine years.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:90%
So I was vegetarian.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
I cleansed.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:90%
I fasted.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I meditated.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I lived in fresh air.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
a great foundation

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.767 align:middle line:90%
to help me treat my ADHD.

00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have those symptoms.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so you did that with
that type of training

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:55.949 align:middle line:90%
with meditation.

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And it helped,
but it really didn't

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:90%
heal the original condition.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Now for me-- we're all
a little different.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
For me, the original
condition was in second grade,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I fell out of a tree and
had a big concussion--

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
upside down, two-story tree.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Broke both arms-- bones
sticking out my arms.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.232 align:middle line:84%
And they said, how
did I even live

00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%
because if my head had been
turned the slightest bit,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:90%
it would've come off.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a miracle.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.099 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But I had a concussion--
a serious concussion.

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:22.349 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You didn't break
your neck, or just your arms?

00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:23.098 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: It didn't.

00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:90%
But my life changed.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't realize
as a second-grader

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.416 align:middle line:84%
how your life has changed
because everything's

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:90%
growing and changing.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:90%
So that affected my brain.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I had the classic ADD
symptoms, which is distracted.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I would go off in my world
of creating this and creating

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Typically, what I find
the same condition

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that a concussion creates,
also the same condition if you

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:90%
have antibiotics in your gut.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
good gut bacteria,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
your liver makes a particular
antioxidant called glutathione.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's a new word that
people all need to know about.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Glutathione is a protein
that your liver makes.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And it will prevent what's
called oxidative stress

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.017 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Any time you have
injury to the brain,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:90%
it's called oxidative stress.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
That's two new terms today--
glutathione and oxidative

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
stress.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
There's over 150,000 studies on
PubMed saying oxidative stress

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is the source of Parkinson's,
is the source of dementia,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
is the source of Asperger's.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
conditions-- ADHD, anxiety,

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.009 align:middle line:84%
depression-- you can find high
levels of oxidative stress

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It just eats
away at the brain?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: It's a simple
way of looking at.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
It's injury that stays there,
and it doesn't get healed.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Now what causes
injury to the brain

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%
is what's called free radicals.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.816 align:middle line:84%
Now we've all heard
about free radicals.

00:10:43.816 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to figure these things
out, but we've all heard them.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Simply, a free radical is every
time your body makes energy,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
a free radical is produced.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And every time a free
radical is produced,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
your body makes an
antioxidant to neutralize it.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.735 align:middle line:90%
That's glutathione.

00:10:57.735 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.538 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: But guess what?

00:10:59.538 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Our modern world in
the last 30 years

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
has suppressed
glutathione production.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So here you are, making
all these free radicals,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.175 align:middle line:84%
and there's no antioxidants
to neutralize it.

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, Dr. Perlmutter's
written a book on this.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And he shows one of
his YouTube videos.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a man with Parkinson's--

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's hobbling, and
he can't hardly talk.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And he gives him a
glutathione IV drip.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And after the drip, he's
walking and he's talking.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you see it

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
so the liver is making
the glutathione.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain supplements

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that you can take, certain
dietary changes you can make,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
certain behavioral changes
you need to make in order

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
for your liver to
make glutathione.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%

I mean, if you don't have

00:12:24.746 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
you get in an
argument and fight.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You can't resolve it.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you have an
elevated cortisol level.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Elevated cortisol--
stress-- inhibits

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:90%
glutathione production.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So once you don't have the
glutathione production,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
then you start having
injury in your brain.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's always happening, and
then the body heals it.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.302 align:middle line:84%
But you can't heal it
if you're stressed,

00:12:42.302 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:90%
that being one of the things.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.402 align:middle line:84%
You can't heal it if you have
a high-carbohydrate diet.

sugar has nothing

And you know what,

It's not sugar.

Now let's say you had your
orange juice after a meal.

Then it's going to have

It's all about when
your blood sugar spikes.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
just not eating much

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%

orange juice, you're

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
These are
amphetamine-like drugs.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's literally considered by
the Drug Enforcement Agency

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.485 align:middle line:84%
to be the same thing as
cocaine and methamphetamines.

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're giving--

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is sugar,
though, isn't it?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Sugar's not as bad.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.835 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Sugar works in
a different pathway.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But the
problem with sugar

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
is that sugar also stimulates
high levels of dopamine,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
which creates an ADHD
brain-- an addictive brain.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.034 align:middle line:84%
But what sugar also
does, when it gradually

00:16:56.034 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
turns into chronically
high blood sugar,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.825 align:middle line:84%
low blood sugar, high blood
sugar, low blood sugar,

00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
what's happening at
that point is your liver

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:90%
no longer makes glutathione.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Now glutathione-- I
mentioned one thing it does.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.495 align:middle line:84%
It protects your brain
from injury, first thing.

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
And your brain's always
potentially being

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.037 align:middle line:84%
injured because you're
thinking thoughts.

00:17:12.037 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
You're doing things.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:84%
What people don't realize
is that when they hear

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
"free-radical damage,"
they go, heavy metals,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
massive free-radical
damage, toxicity,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.625 align:middle line:90%
massive free-radical damage.

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stress.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Stress, massive
free-radical damage.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
But also not stress.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Just thinking, right now
in this conversation,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
we're producing massive
amounts of free radicals.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
If we went for a little
job on the beach--

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
I was just surfing--

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We'd get rid of them.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: --massive
amounts of free radicals.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yes, yes.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But a healthy body's
designed to make

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.735 align:middle line:84%
glutathione that neutralizes
those free radicals.

00:17:39.735 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.284 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: So free radicals
are not a bad thing.

00:17:42.284 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just that when we
don't have glutathione,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:90%
they become a bad thing.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It's in balance.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like too much of
anything is a bad thing.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have balance--
the yin-yang balance,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:90%
male-female energy.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
My whole life is about
teaching about balance.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm teaching--
helping people understand.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We've got to find the
natural ways to produce

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the glutathione
that one, protects

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the brain from
free-radical damage,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
which is inevitable
in our lives, which

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
is multiplied by 10 due
to heavy-metal toxicity.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So heavy-metal toxicity takes
a already the big barrage

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
of free radicals in the brain
and multiplies it times 10.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like a chemical reaction.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
If you take potassium
and put it in water,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:90%
it will spark into fire.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a chemical reaction.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So the chemical reaction
of mercury in your brain

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
causes massive degeneration
of connective tissue

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
between the neurons, and
the neurons start dying.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have billions
of these neurons.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So you don't notice
it right away,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.986 align:middle line:84%
unless the brain
is just developing.

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they
don't even develop.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.318 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if a relationship
starts to go sour,

00:18:41.318 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
it's because the brain
is starting to diffuse

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and actually get damaged.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that leads later--
those are the earliest signs

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
that you can detect, right,

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:84%
when the relationship
starts to go south.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.383 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, I don't know
if we can say that exactly.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But we can draw some
correlations to it.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
My relationship is
a good relationship.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And it just got so much better
when I healed the Parkinson's.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.479 align:middle line:90%
It was slowly declining.

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:90%
We love each other.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.728 align:middle line:84%
We have great
communication skills.

00:19:10.728 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:90%
But the juice just wasn't there.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I figured
out the natural supplements

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and the healing regime in
order to heal my Parkinson's,

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
which also has now been
proven in studies to heal

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:90%
ADHD symptoms.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.687 align:middle line:90%
It's the same condition.

00:19:23.687 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.311 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And it will help.

00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just some conditions
like autism are more severe.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's oxidative
stress in the brain.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:84%
You could just simply call
it inhibited brain function.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And it works in
different places,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.283 align:middle line:90%
but you can generalize it.

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:84%
You can say, why
is the grass brown?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can go
into deep science

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, we don't
know this, but we know this.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just say,
you didn't water it.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are simple
solutions to things.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.294 align:middle line:84%
And I watch all
the scientists say,

00:19:47.294 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
we really don't know
the answer to this.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.043 align:middle line:90%
And I go, are you kidding?

00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:53.240 align:middle line:84%
There's 150,000 studies
correlating directly oxidative

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:84%
stress with brain
injury, which is going

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:90%
on with all of these issues.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Gut health-- having healthy
gut is directly related

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%
to cancer, heart disease.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
All these things is gut health.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have the
right bacteria in our gut,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
which is wiped out
by antibiotics.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And you get enough
of that, you just

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
can't make those good proteins
that allow your vitamin D

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to work, which activates
your immune system to attack

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and destroy your cancer.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
You start to see why do
we have so much cancer?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have so
much heart disease?

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have so
many brain issues?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.487 align:middle line:84%
We have 35 times more
diagnosed mental illness today.

00:20:31.487 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Now certainly, we're
diagnosing more things.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.085 align:middle line:90%
But why are we?

00:20:34.085 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Because people
are more troubled.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
One out of five women are
taking anti-depressants.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
People are spending
all their time

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.042 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- what can
I do to be happy?

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to
be happy-- instead

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.083 align:middle line:84%
of just doing what
you're going to do,

00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and happiness follows you.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
There's something missing here
in our lifestyle that has a lot

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
to do with diet and exercise.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.075 align:middle line:84%
And really, I'm really
focusing this on just toxicity.

00:20:56.075 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to cleanse the
toxicity and protect ourselves.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a big
part of it, also.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you do get
healthy, I want

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to have you take a
look at a video here.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
John's talking about writing
a letter to resolve conflict

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.431 align:middle line:90%
in the relationship category.

00:21:08.431 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But it really has a lot to do
with what we're talking about,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
healthwise, because
once you get balance,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.196 align:middle line:84%
you're able to deal with
emotional relationship tools

00:21:15.196 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
just like this.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Hi.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. John Gray, author
of "Men Are from Mars,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Women Are from Venus."

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And in one of my previous
blogs, I talked about one

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
tools that has

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
helped me experience
transformation

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and lower stress in my life.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
Feeling Letter Technique.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
When I first wrote about it
in my first book 30 years ago,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:84%
"What You Feel You Can Heal,"
it was called the Love Letter

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Technique because you start
out expressing painful emotions

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and get back to
feelings of love.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I explained it in
greater detail, which

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is going through feelings
of anger and sadness

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and fear and regret, getting
in touch with your pure desire.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And within that is
the seed of wisdom

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.385 align:middle line:84%
and knowing how to forgive, how
to embrace, how to appreciate,

00:21:57.385 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
how to feel grateful.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And writing that out,
you get resolution.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.226 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for
many, many years.

00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I was
able to keep coming back

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
to love to be able to
understand my own marriage

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
in a nonjudgmental
way and came up

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
with the ideas for "Men Are from
Mars, Women Are From Venus."

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
The great thing
about that book--

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
it's a nonjudgmental
way to understand

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
the differences between
men and women, which

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
is why it rings such a beautiful
bell for everybody because we

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:90%
don't want to hate our partners.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
reject our partners.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.336 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
criticize our partners.

00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there's an answer
as to how we can actually

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
understand our partners with
compassion, with empathy,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and with a knowing of how
to support them and get

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:90%
the support that we need.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
things would upset me.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I didn't fully
understand a situation,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd feel criticized or blamed
or rejected or whatever--

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
the things we all go
through in relationships.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'd start to shut down.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'd do the Feeling
Letter exercise,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't complete.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And I went, wow, this
technique has worked for years

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
and has stopped working.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized I had
gotten to a more advanced stage

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
of healing to where I needed
to go to the next level.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the next level was once
I got in touch with what

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I wanted and wished
and needed, then

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:90%
I write out the response letter.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And the response
letter is what do I

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:90%
need to hear from my partner?

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What would I like them to say?

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
What do I like
them to do for me?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
How would I want
them to support me?

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And imagine them-- this
is using your imagination.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And imagination's
important because all

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:84%
of our emotional
reactions are reacting

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.009 align:middle line:84%
to what the front part of our
brain says is what's going on.

00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do
is imagine something.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And your middle
part of the brain

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.706 align:middle line:84%
where you're upset
actually thinks it's real.

00:23:37.706 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So what you do after getting
in touch with what you want,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
what you need, what you want
to hear, the kind of support

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to receive, then write
a letter from your partner

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to you-- or from the person
that you're upset with.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine them
writing you a letter

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and saying to you all the
things that you need to hear.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine-- that's
the response letter.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.177 align:middle line:84%
Then imagine how you would
feel if that was real.

00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you'll notice
yeah, I feel so much better.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I feel like everything's OK now.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel grateful that
I have you in my life.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I feel understood.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And start writing out what
you appreciate, what you're

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.149 align:middle line:90%
grateful for, what you forgive.

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:16.565 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever
noticed how it's

00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
so much easier to forgive
somebody if they say,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have them
say, I'm so sorry.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
imagination, it still

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
works to release your
tension-- the stress.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So now you can go back to
the situation and look at it

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and deal with it
in a loving way.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So you write out your emotions.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that person saying the
things you need to hear to feel

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:90%
heard.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Then imagine how it
would make you feel.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And you write out those
feelings using appreciation,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
using understanding, using
forgiveness, using gratitude,

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:90%
using trust.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't say,
I trust that, you

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
can use another phrase, which
is right now in my life,

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I am in the process of making
this relationship better,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
or growing in love together,
understanding our problems

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and coming closer.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start
moving towards the future

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
in a positive way to
resolve a situation

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
because when situations
remain unresolved,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
then tension continues inside
that affects everyone and all

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
of our relationships.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the advanced
Feeling Letter Technique.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have whole new
challenges today.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What we have to recognize--
any parent knows,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.676 align:middle line:84%
our children are more
conscious than we are.

00:25:28.676 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Our children are different
from our generation.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:90%
They're much more aware.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the more aware you
are, the more aware

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
you are of what's
going on inside.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So the more you're
aware of what's inside,

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.937 align:middle line:84%
you become more connected
to your feelings.

00:25:40.937 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know how to
manage your feelings, which

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking about,
then you hold them inside.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And your stress levels go up.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So one aspect of
your risk of disease

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
increases the more
conscious you are.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a very important thing.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Because see, when you're aware,
you're aware of what you want

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.337 align:middle line:90%
and what you deserve.

00:26:00.337 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:90%
You have good self-esteem.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.044 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
don't get it, there's

00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a tendency to feel more anger,
more fear, more concern.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:84%
We have higher expectations
of ourselves, of the world.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be more upset.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to manage
those feelings to become experts

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is how
you went from talking

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.066 align:middle line:84%
about relationships,
which you have done

00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
so well over the years, to
ending this conversation

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.371 align:middle line:90%
into the health aspect of it.

00:26:22.371 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: That's right because
I've managed my emotions.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I went from
Transcendental Meditation

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:84%
to rising above my emotions
to then diving deep

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
into the depths of my emotions,
cleansing all that out,

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
becoming a very
nonjudgmental person,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
then working out those
differences between men

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and women-- how to see our
differences in a positive way,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:90%
rather than a negative way.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to 50, and
you realize, I got all that.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.615 align:middle line:90%
I still got issues to work on?

00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It'd be for me.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:90%
That's my journey.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It became looking
at the health issues

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that there's
a huge epidemic.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It manifests in a different
way in the public eye

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.720 align:middle line:90%
as health insurance crisis.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:90%
It's really a health crisis.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It's health is costing
so much because there's

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:90%
no health in it.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all sickness management.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all drugs, which cause
dangerous side effects.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.192 align:middle line:84%
And when I've been to all these
different indigenous tribes

00:27:08.192 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
where people don't
have these sicknesses.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.649 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
how rare cancer was.

00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or obesity.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about
that for a second.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, well let's
talk about one thing.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There's some studies
on obesity that

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
show that if you
take a thin person

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and you take some
of their gut flora

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and put it into an
obese person's gut,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.616 align:middle line:90%
that obese person becomes thin.

00:27:28.616 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now why don't they market
that, I don't know.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But they think that's weird
to take somebody's poop

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.586 align:middle line:84%
and put it in you because
that's where the bacteria is.

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:36.336 align:middle line:90%
It's in your poop.

00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:37.669 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Could be a little weird.

00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But the point is
it's all about the gut.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the second brain.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're learning.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.409 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's where people put
on the most weight, as well.

00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the overall weight-loss
conversation doesn't

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:84%
have anything to do
with diets, necessarily,

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
or even-- exercise
is a big part of it.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do with cleansing
the toxicity out of the body.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn how
to eat right and get

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:84%
these supplements into
the body, then the weight

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:90%
comes off naturally.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
The brain starts to heal itself.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
When you look at somebody
who is in great shape,

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
they are in love with
being in great shape.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
They're not trying to diet.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying
to lose weight.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.621 align:middle line:84%
They're just staying

It's a different conversation.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And it's a
mindset because see,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
when you have symptoms of
ADHD to various degrees, what

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you have is compulsive desires
for the very things that

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
are not good for you.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Now let me explain that, OK?

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share with parents
that ADHD is under-diagnosed

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
in our children today
because we're only diagnosing

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%
hyperactive or hyperdistracted.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
hypersensitive, and there's

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.377 align:middle line:84%
hypercompulsive, which
shows up as a child who's

00:28:45.377 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:90%
always hard on themselves.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to be perfect.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
do everything right.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:90%
They're beating themselves up.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You get the hyperactive
child who can't stay still.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
You get the
hyperdistracted child who's

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:90%
disorganized all the time.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:84%
You get the
hypersensitive-- these

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.170 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who
are being affected

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:90%
by our environment the most.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And also, their heart is
hurting because they're giving,

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.658 align:middle line:90%
and they're not getting back.

00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And these are just
natural temperaments,

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
which become hyper
temperaments once we

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.106 align:middle line:84%
have this oxidative
stress in the brain.

00:29:11.106 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is what's happened.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Normal people-- whatever
our challenges are in life

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
are becoming much bigger
due to this hyperstimulation

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:90%
of our environment.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And hyperstimulation
can be stress.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It can be sugar, which
hyperstimulates our body.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:90%

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You can measure-- internet
pornography is extremely

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
similar to heroin--
one of the most

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:90%
addictive things in the world.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you get addicted
to internet pornography,

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
your ability to feel passion
in a regular relationship

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
is diminished.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
The same concept
is when you become

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
addicted to playing video games,
that's producing more dopamine.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Now dopamine is what
motivates us in life.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We feel motivated
towards things that

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
will make dopamine because
dopamine gives us pleasure.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine gives us focus.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine is always there when
something's interesting to us.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So anything that raises higher
dopamine levels-- that's

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
called overstimulation-- causes
are brain to change instantly.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Within a minute, the
receptor sites on the neurons

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:90%
begin to close and disappear.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So maybe you had 100.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Now you have 70.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
If you took cocaine, the
first shot of cocaine,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:84%
you've just lost 30%
of your receptor sites.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Forever?

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.364 align:middle line:84%

No, they will come back, as
long as you stop the cocaine.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
like alcoholics,

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
they have a certain gene that
converts alcohol into dopamine.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Half the population could
never be an alcoholic.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
They don't even drink because
they don't have that gene that

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:90%
converts alcohol into dopamine.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But when those people who have
the gene, when they drink,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:90%
the dopamine levels shoot up.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
The neurons start
down-regulating.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:90%
That's called down-regulation.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.955 align:middle line:84%
So now, normal life is no longer
giving you the stimulation

00:31:02.955 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
that you used to get.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.800 align:middle line:84%

>>GRAY: It's all
about relationships.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So the newness of a
relation-- some people

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
can't make a commitment
to a relationship

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.004 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
enough dopamine receptors.

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So they need something
new and exciting.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I just met you.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, you're new.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Any time someone's new, it
stimulates more dopamine.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But once we become
familiar, we're predictable,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to make that
high level of dopamine,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:90%
and we lose interest.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
If you have healthy dopamine
receptor size, then even

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.452 align:middle line:84%
the mundane-- life's
routine-- becomes fun.

His brain was chaotic.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Two days with

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.260 align:middle line:84%

And there were other

Pycnogenol is a

extract to protect it

00:36:35.187 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:90%
It's an antioxidant.

It protects the bugs

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
grape seed extract.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.904 align:middle line:90%
that they would fast on.

00:38:35.904 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I had talked to a guy.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:84%
He showed me his books--
three giant books.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.721 align:middle line:84%
He said, all these are
the herbs for everything--

00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:41.940 align:middle line:90%
the treatments and so forth.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But for them to work, you
have to follow this diet.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And what was the diet?

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, they
call it buttermilk.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the milk, when you take the
butter out of the milk, what's

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
left is their buttermilk, which
is what we call whey protein.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.482 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that got
casein in it or no?

00:38:56.482 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: No, whey is
separate from casein.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it is.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: There's two types
of protein in dairy.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:90%
20% of dairy protein is whey.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:90%
The 80% is casein.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And many people are
sensitive to the casein.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
However, if you're not,
it's really good for you.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:12.709 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: OK.

00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a casein-whey
drink every day.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.989 align:middle line:84%
Casein-- I mean, it's
what's in mother's milk.

00:39:16.989 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's what it was in cow's milk.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
these amino acids

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.759 align:middle line:84%
to build muscle,
to build the brain.

00:39:22.759 --> 00:39:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And repair.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: And repair.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.465 align:middle line:84%
It's only if you
have compromised

00:39:25.465 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
digestion, which
autistic children have,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:90%
casein's not good for you.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
casein-- and that's

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.781 align:middle line:90%
cheese is mainly casein.

00:39:32.781 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's in cheese.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
casein is most people

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.544 align:middle line:90%
are using pasteurized casein.

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which means
it's been processed.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: That's right.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.145 align:middle line:90%
It's processed.

00:39:43.145 --> 00:39:46.080 align:middle line:84%
If you heat processed dairy,
it doesn't digest easily.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You lose the enzymes
when you heat it up.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.275 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I said
undenatured whey protein.

00:39:51.275 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But also, if
you have undenatured

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:84%
casein protein along
with it, if you're not

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:84%
resistant to that
or allergic to that,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
it's even more powerful
because then the casein

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.440 align:middle line:90%
goes to your muscles.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the whey protein can
go right to your brain.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Whey protein only lasts for
50 minutes in your body.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.687 align:middle line:90%
Casein lasts for five hours.

00:40:08.687 --> 00:40:10.145 align:middle line:84%
So you want to give
the sustenance.

00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big difference.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Yeah.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.756 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a look at John

00:40:12.756 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:84%
talking about his book, "Staying
Focused in a Hyper World."

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Hi.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. John Gray.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.921 align:middle line:84%
And you probably know me as the
author of "Men Are from Mars,

00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Women Are from Venus."

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, about 12 years ago after
that huge success of a book,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:90%
I had Parkinson's disease.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Now as you can see, I
don't have it anymore.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
When I went to my doctor, he
said, oh, there's treatment.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I knew
what the treatment was.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I'd given it to my aunt.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Whereas she was taking
her medication over time,

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to give more and
more until it doesn't work.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And then she dies.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:90%
So yes, there's medication.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
heal the condition.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And the condition
only gets worse.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So I found natural
solutions, which

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I write about this-- natural
solutions for optimal brain

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:84%
function, brain performance,
memory, and for ADHD.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Now how does ADHD
figure in here?

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, once I healed
my Parkinson's disease

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.890 align:middle line:84%
with natural
solutions-- no drugs--

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:84%
healed the condition in my
brain, something else happened.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:90%
My ADHD symptoms went away.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know I had ADHD.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You may have ADHD, and
you don't know it, either,

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
because ADHD is much bigger
than what they describe.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.910 align:middle line:84%
They describe with ADHD
children in classrooms.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But as we become adults,
the symptoms change.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I found was
the same solutions that

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:84%
helped me heal the condition
that gave rise to Parkinson's,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that same condition
had given rise to ADHD

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.985 align:middle line:90%
throughout my life.

00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I was able to go back
and say, yes, I have this.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't know when we
were growing up at my age

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.075 align:middle line:90%
that there was an ADHD.

00:41:45.075 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly
didn't know that there

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:90%
were natural solutions for it.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Kind of glad they
didn't diagnose it then,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:84%
or I would've had
been medicated.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Medication-- and I
prove in this new book,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:84%
which is "Staying Focused
in a Hyper World"--

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
medication only makes the
condition worse over time.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I know many people have
benefited from medication.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But wow, wouldn't it be great
if you had no side effects

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and you could actually
eliminate the problem-- you

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:90%
could solve the problem?

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what you
have the opportunity

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:90%
to achieve in this book.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Now there was so much
information around

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:22.040 align:middle line:84%
what causes ADHD and memory
problems and dementia

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and Alzheimer's, it
turned into three books.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:90%
So I have triplets.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:29.784 align:middle line:84%
The main book is "Staying
Focused in a Hyper World"

00:42:29.784 --> 00:42:30.950 align:middle line:90%
because we're all scattered.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:35.009 align:middle line:84%
As adults, the way ADHD effects
us quite commonly is men,

00:42:35.009 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
they get addicted
to certain things--

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:84%
their work, videos, TV, the
news, whatever it might be,

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.400 align:middle line:90%
or sports.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:84%
We get addicted to this, and
we lose focus on a relationship

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and the passion
in our marriages.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:90%
We lose it.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Women, they tend to lose
focus on their own needs.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And they over-give to others.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And they feel stressed
and overwhelmed.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they have less to
give to their intimate partner.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So as far as relationships goes,
now with understanding of ADHD,

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that almost
every couple I've counseled

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:90%
had some version of ADHD.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I describe in my new
book 132 different symptoms

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.072 align:middle line:84%
that clear up when you
heal the condition of ADHD.

00:43:15.072 --> 00:43:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And generally, most
people will fit

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:90%
into some of those conditions.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And these are natural solutions.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And half the books--
I made three books.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Half of each book,
or particularly half

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
of the first book where
the most science is there,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.690 align:middle line:84%
is references, where these
double-blind studies have

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:84%
proven to have natural
solutions to heal ADHD, improve

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.240 align:middle line:90%
your memory, and so forth.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
documented for you

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in this new book or
these three new books.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is the "Natural
Solutions for ADHD, Memory,

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and Brain Performance."

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about the
15 different causes,

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:84%
with all the documentation
proving what causes it.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:84%
In the media, nobody
knows what causes ADHD.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Second, what are the
natural solutions

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:90%
that work better than drugs?

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And you say, is this
John Gray saying this?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got double-blind
studies from universities

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- even
32 studies from the FDA--

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:84%
talking about natural solutions
that you haven't heard about.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, it's in this book.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first one.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Second book is we're
going to explore

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:84%
how to decrease stress to
increase happiness, passion,

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and vitality.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We know that stress
causes cancer.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We know that stress kills
passion in marriage.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that stress is
the opposite of happiness.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's find
three action steps.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've divided this book in
three steps-- the action steps

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to help heal the brain
of these conditions

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and restore happiness, passion,
and vitality in our lives.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because see, taking
natural supplements

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.599 align:middle line:84%
and natural solutions is
giving you the building blocks.

00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
to take action to do it.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:84%
What are those actions to
stimulate the brain to heal?

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:90%
So I go into that in book two.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.420 align:middle line:84%
In book three, I talk
about the super-fuel

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to relax and recharge
your brain power.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to recharge
your brain power.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.700 align:middle line:90%
I work all day.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.269 align:middle line:90%
My brain-- I lose my juice.

00:45:16.269 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
how to recharge it.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain
supplements to help

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.650 align:middle line:84%
you recharge the
brain, certain insights

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to help you recharge the brain.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a diet
that you can follow

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.880 align:middle line:90%
that will recharge your brain.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I've
got the actual studies

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.982 align:middle line:90%
to back it all up.

00:45:31.982 --> 00:45:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Where do you hear that?

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You just hear this good
diet, that good diet.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual biology
of recharging your brain

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.720 align:middle line:90%
by the foods that you eat.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You will understand how
your body and brain work.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You will understand the
biological foundation

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of lasting passion, libido,
energy, focus, memory.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:84%
As you get older,
you do not have

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to lose your passion,
your vitality.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.450 align:middle line:90%
You can relax.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can continue
to recharge your brain

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:03.259 align:middle line:84%
and stay focused in
this hyper world.

00:46:03.259 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see that
one of the reasons

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:84%
you're so passionate
about health

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and how it impacts
our relationships is

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
the massive rise of
pharmaceutical drugs

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that many, many people are on
and that the pharmaceutical

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:84%
industry has really
been committed

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.681 align:middle line:90%
to giving us information about.

00:46:19.681 --> 00:46:20.680 align:middle line:90%
You see the commercials.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.263 align:middle line:84%
You see all the
information out there.

00:46:22.263 --> 00:46:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's heavily promoted to
improve "quality of life."

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:84%
What are your feelings about
Adderall, SSRIs, Ritalin--

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:90%
massively prescribed?

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Most people don't know
that those major drug companies

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
have been paying
billions of dollars

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in fines for misinformation--
billions of dollars,

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.550 align:middle line:84%
all of the major ones--
billions of dollars in fines.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.699 align:middle line:84%
And even one person who
was critical of my book

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.740 align:middle line:84%
was writing all sorts of
negative things about it

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.010 align:middle line:90%
because I say the truth.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The truth is these drugs they're
giving to children as well

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as to adults all have
dangerous side effects.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.576 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it says
that on the commercials.

00:46:53.576 --> 00:46:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Death is ultimately--

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.029 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: But the doctors
will tell people,

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.950 align:middle line:84%
there's only a few
people that happens to.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.410 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't know--
and doctors don't know this,

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:02.910 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There's just hearing what
the drug reps are saying.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:08.530 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you take an SSRI,
Selective Serotonin Reuptake

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Inhibitor-- what people
are given for depression

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.760 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety-- your first
pill, your cortisol levels

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.220 align:middle line:90%
will double.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol-- that's
your stress hormone.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Your brain flattens out, and
your stress levels shoot up.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what, do
you feel excited?

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: No.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize, when
somebody's depressed,

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:25.970 align:middle line:84%
their cortisol
levels are very high.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So this doubles it?

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Doubles it.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel it.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.180 align:middle line:90%
But your cortisol levels double.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Now why that's
significant-- as soon

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.824 align:middle line:84%
as your cortisol levels double,
your gut bacteria start dying.

00:47:36.824 --> 00:47:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's always the
root problem right

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.240 align:middle line:84%
there is you don't
have a healthy gut.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't make your glutathione
when your cortisol levels

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.140 align:middle line:90%
are higher.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to crave
sugar, which people do,

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.630 align:middle line:90%
because they can't burn fat.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why people start getting
fatter on antidepressants.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:51.886 align:middle line:84%
And you don't burn fat
when you're stressed.

00:47:51.886 --> 00:47:52.510 align:middle line:90%
You burn sugar.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:90%
You crave sugar.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And now you don't
make glutathione.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
downward slide from there.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And people don't have an option.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Doctors don't know the option.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:84%
They're just told what the
drug reps are telling them.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And here I am out here,
coming and telling people

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.490 align:middle line:90%
the side effects of this stuff.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I'm
most concerned about

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.674 align:middle line:84%
is the 6-year-olds
and the 10-year-olds

00:48:09.674 --> 00:48:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and the 15-year-olds.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:15.180 align:middle line:84%
While their brain is developing
and you give them a Adderall

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:84%
or Ritalin-- these
are the equivalent

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:90%
of cocaine and methamphetamine.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.065 align:middle line:84%
And they rewire the brain to
seek out higher stimulation.

00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Addiction.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: And they've proven
now-- and the long-term studies

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.614 align:middle line:90%
have finally come out.

00:48:24.614 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And I quote them in my book.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I've got 80 pages of
these studies showing,

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to various degrees--
the best study is

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard University--
showing long-term injury

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
for children who have
taken Ritalin or Adderall--

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.360 align:middle line:84%
long-term injury in the brain,
which inhibits the ability

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to be motivated later in life,
creates sedentary lifestyle,

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.307 align:middle line:90%
creates passivity.

00:48:46.307 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And creates
bad relationships.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Of course.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:90%
They can't make a commitment.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.593 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
have that motivation.

00:48:51.593 --> 00:48:52.720 align:middle line:90%
All that is going downhill.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing is
just a few years later,

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing
everybody's not getting

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:57.720 align:middle line:90%
involved in relationships.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:84%
There's twice as
many single people

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.860 align:middle line:84%
as their used to be
proportional to our population.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.824 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Higher incidence
of divorce, et cetera.

00:49:03.824 --> 00:49:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So how long does someone
have to take those in order

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to have that type of damage?

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Oh, one year.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Now that's what they say.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now they haven't used
the natural solutions

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.680 align:middle line:90%
to heal the brain.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I help people heal within
sometimes a few weeks,

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.114 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a few months,
sometimes a year.

00:49:18.114 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:84%
You watch them getting
better and better and better.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The brain has enormous capacity
to regenerate itself and heal

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.030 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But then it needs extra
support to do that.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Like an amazing
thing, every parent

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.700 align:middle line:84%
should know-- I've been
teaching this 12 years.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.735 align:middle line:84%
Finally, somebody
did a study on it.

00:49:32.735 --> 00:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was in England
where they did a study.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.010 align:middle line:84%
They took autistic children
who didn't have eye contact,

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:90%
couldn't communicate.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And they put them in-- it's part
of a hot-water bath treatment.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They put them in a warm bath at
98 degrees, which normally, you

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.700 align:middle line:84%
put children in
a 98-degree bath.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.070 align:middle line:90%
That's like warm water for them.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Put them in 102
degrees, although I

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.590 align:middle line:90%
recommend 103 degrees.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But the study proved 102
degrees, all 32 children all

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:84%
dramatically improved in their
symptoms taking a hot bath

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.680 align:middle line:90%
at 102 degrees.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.403 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Well, this is
why I've been teaching

00:50:05.403 --> 00:50:07.614 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
causes of autism is

00:50:07.614 --> 00:50:09.530 align:middle line:84%
when they get their
vaccinations, which that's

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.860 align:middle line:84%
very controversial, but I know
hundreds of parents who said,

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I got a vaccination.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:16.530 align:middle line:84%
My child got sick
and never came back.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:90%
What did they do, that parent?

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.340 align:middle line:84%
They followed their
doctor's instruction.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.507 align:middle line:90%
The child got sick.

00:50:21.507 --> 00:50:24.090 align:middle line:84%
See, not every child gets sick
with a vaccination, which means

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:90%
they had a stronger system.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:28.430 align:middle line:84%

There's actually no

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.691 align:middle line:84%
It's just if it's over

00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it means there's a

00:51:29.179 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%
You could have little seizures.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:84%

But they don't hurt
the child at all.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.568 align:middle line:84%
And many times, the children

It's just a healing response.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
low glutathione,

a high fever promotes the
production of glutathione.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.605 align:middle line:84%
It will stop the

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.744 align:middle line:84%

00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Glutathione protects us
from oxidative stress.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Glutathione is the
precursor to making

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:90%
dopamine, which gives us focus.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the precursor to
making serotonin that allows

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:90%
us to be happy and relaxed.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the precursor of GABA

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:25.970 align:middle line:90%
into our life.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:27.386 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
glutathione, you

00:52:27.386 --> 00:52:30.050 align:middle line:84%
can't make an abundance
of these brain chemicals.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Then the third thing, OK, you've
got it's a precursor to brain--

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and it also is the
regulator of detoxification.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:84%
You cannot remove heavy-metal
toxicity in your body if you

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.820 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough glutathione.

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.720 align:middle line:84%

You have no cortisol.

>>LISA: Infertility--
you just nailed

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.430 align:middle line:90%
that on the head-- infertility.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Oh, complete
with infertility.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I remember, well,
it was in the '90s,

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:34.760 align:middle line:84%
it was actually rare
to be infertile.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And then now, it's like
over a third of couples

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.590 align:middle line:84%
are having a doctor
help them get pregnant.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Talk about relationship
strain-- absolutely.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.244 align:middle line:84%
Well, books two and three
address some of those issues.

00:55:45.244 --> 00:55:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You've written a
three-book series here.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.840 align:middle line:84%
This is just the first--
this "Staying Focused

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.140 align:middle line:90%
in a Hyper World."

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.237 align:middle line:84%
And the second and third
address other issues, as well,

00:55:54.237 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
which will be coming
out soon, which I

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.380 align:middle line:90%
think we're looking forward to.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Right.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Second one addresses
mindset to go with it.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And third one is diet.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But before you can
follow a healthy diet,

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.840 align:middle line:84%
your brain has to
be working well.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.925 align:middle line:84%
Things like vitamin
C, picnoginal--

00:56:06.925 --> 00:56:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gluthathione.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Glutathione-- well, all
the precursors for glutathione.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And probably the most important
is restoring your gut health,

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.820 align:middle line:90%
which is beneficial probiotics.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's wonderful
different probiotics.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.660 align:middle line:84%
My favorite is you
make it at home.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.430 align:middle line:90%
You make yogurt at home.

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And you get a starter
that has 42 strains.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.070 align:middle line:84%
That's all of the strains
in the microbiome.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen in
Switzerland, I've

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.590 align:middle line:84%
seen in my own clientele,
people who even

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:33.890 align:middle line:90%
have cancer healing the cancer.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Why does it do it?

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it activates
vitamin D, and vitamin D

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:90%
activates your immune system.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And your immune system
can cure anything.

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, so--

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: --if you catch it.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --is that the same thing
as kefir or different than?

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:45.741 align:middle line:84%
>>GRAY: Kefir also has
good bacteria in it.

00:56:45.741 --> 00:56:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Kefir is good.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But the key to it
is your starter.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.570 align:middle line:84%
How many probiotics
are in your starter?

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
something called GcMAF

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.802 align:middle line:84%
which is the protein that
protects you from cancer

00:56:55.802 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
diseases because it activates

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:59.840 align:middle line:84%
called vitamin D
binding protein.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And so out of Switzerland, they
have certain yogurt starters

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that will make the GcMAF.

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:05.220 align:middle line:90%
You can buy.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.639 align:middle line:90%
It's very expensive to get it.

00:57:06.639 --> 00:57:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
make it at home.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:90%
People can learn about that.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.114 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness--
so much information.

00:57:11.114 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for joining me, John.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.410 align:middle line:84%
You are just a wealth
of information.

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:18.839 align:middle line:84%
I love how you came from talking
about the relationships to now

00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:20.880 align:middle line:84%
ultimately talking about
health that circles back

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.921 align:middle line:90%
to healthy relationships.

00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:23.117 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:57:23.117 --> 00:57:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRAY: Oh, you're very welcome.

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's such a pleasure
to talk about this.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mine, too.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.741 align:middle line:84%
