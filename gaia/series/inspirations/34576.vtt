>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa
Garr, host of Gaiam Inspiration.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.289 align:middle line:84%
Science has shown
us that 90 percent

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:84%
of illnesses are stress-related,
and a major source

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.029 align:middle line:84%
of that stress comes from our
minds and the negative thoughts

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.999 align:middle line:84%
that we had that are
stressful to the body.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.034 align:middle line:84%
Today, my guest, Inna
Segal, is the creator

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.104 align:middle line:84%
of Visionary Intuitive Healing,
and she's joining us to talk

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.507 align:middle line:84%
about how to clear
those negative thoughts

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:42.109 align:middle line:90%
so that we can be responsible

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.779 align:middle line:84%
for our own well-being
and self-healing.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:45.679 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:46.847 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Inna Segal: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:48.916 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: That's great.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:53.287 align:middle line:84%
So I love the fact that you are
teaching us to be responsible

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:55.156 align:middle line:90%
for our own self-healing rather

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:58.192 align:middle line:84%
than you being the
healer saying, "Come to me

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:01.028 align:middle line:84%
and you can have all of
your healing done by me."

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Why did you choose to do

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.233 align:middle line:84%
that even though you
have intuitive gifts?

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Inna Segal: Because I
really believe that all

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.472 align:middle line:84%
of us have those gifts, and
I underscored early on that

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:15.509 align:middle line:84%
if people came to me, it would
be the same as them thinking,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.045 align:middle line:84%
you have the magic wand
and I'm disempowered,

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and you are empowered.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And it would be the
same thing as, you know,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.452 align:middle line:84%
them thinking this
generally in their life,

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.355 align:middle line:84%
and so I really wanted
to surprise people.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.059 align:middle line:84%
I wanted them to discover
how amazing they are,

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:35.629 align:middle line:84%
not just how great I
am and what I can do,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.998 align:middle line:84%
because no matter
what I can tell you,

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:41.101 align:middle line:84%
no matter what memory I
can see inside your body

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:90%
or what physical problem,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.073 align:middle line:84%
it's much more powerful
if you can do that.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:49.677 align:middle line:84%
Because even if people
could see me once or twice,

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
they have their whole life and
they need to connect themselves

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.616 align:middle line:84%
and love their own
bodies and become friends

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
with their bodies, not
just think that someone

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:90%
out there can do this for them.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.821 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Exactly.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.991 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So you've had quite
an experience and a journey

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:07.294 align:middle line:84%
in your own healing
journey, I should say.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice at an early
time you had these gifts?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.001 align:middle line:84%
Or did you get to a place
where you were just not well

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.004 align:middle line:84%
and started to learn
self-healing?

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.207 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: In a way, I feel
that intuition has been part

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:22.443 align:middle line:90%
of my life from early on,

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:25.346 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
know the difference,

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:27.081 align:middle line:84%
I just thought everybody
was like me.

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:30.584 align:middle line:84%
So I would have more of
a feeling and knowing

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.453 align:middle line:84%
that something would
happen and it would happen,

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:35.189 align:middle line:84%
but I really thought it
was like that for everyone.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.424 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to me
was that I was in pain

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.126 align:middle line:90%
for a long time in my life.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I had digestive problems where
I would end up in the hospital

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.431 align:middle line:84%
and doctors didn't know
what to do with me.

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.268 align:middle line:84%
I had psoriasis all
over my skin.

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:48.769 align:middle line:90%
I had anxiety.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.872 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to get a little
bit older into my teenage years,

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.008 align:middle line:90%
I started to get back pain.

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.411 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to see a lot of
health practitioners, doctors,

00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.848 align:middle line:84%
chiropractors, physiotherapists,
and I wasn't getting better.

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:03.784 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to
a turning point --

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.553 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us have a
turning point in our lives --

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.456 align:middle line:84%
and I woke up one day
and I was in agony.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.293 align:middle line:84%
My back was twisted to a point
where I literally couldn't turn.

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:16.196 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what to
do because I was in agony.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my husband to
take me to the chiropractor.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.369 align:middle line:84%
And on the way there, I could
feel every bump in the road.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.172 align:middle line:84%
I was literally going out of
my body it was so painful.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.373 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.775 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: And when I got to
the chiropractor's office,

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:30.577 align:middle line:84%
he came out, took
one look at me,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.046 align:middle line:90%
and said, "Your body's stuck."

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.614 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "I know that part.

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:35.082 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to about this?"

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:38.585 align:middle line:84%
And he was very quiet, and
then he said, "Nothing."

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What do
you mean nothing?"

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.588 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Your body
wants to be stuck.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.124 align:middle line:90%
Go home." On the way home --

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:44.892 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:46.427 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: -- I was so angry.

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:49.463 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of went from
depression to anger.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.665 align:middle line:84%
And I think anger
gives you action.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:56.103 align:middle line:84%
And so what occurred to me was
that when I got to Australia,

00:03:56.103 --> 00:04:00.741 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Russia, and I
didn't know one word of English.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.777 align:middle line:84%
And this was the same problem;
I didn't know one word of how

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to connect to my body and
what language was speaking.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.216 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided, I don't
know how, but I'm going home

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.685 align:middle line:90%
and I am healing myself.

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you just
started from there?

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.688 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of your journey?

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:15.923 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:17.057 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So it sounds like
what you did is you made the

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:18.358 align:middle line:90%
decision first.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.692 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: I made the decision.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:84%
I got home, and I
intuitively understood

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.798 align:middle line:90%
that breath was the key.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, okay.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.869 align:middle line:84%
>> So I placed my hands on my
back and I started to breathe

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.504 align:middle line:84%
into the pain, and
then I started

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:31.905 align:middle line:90%
to count backwards from 30.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:35.376 align:middle line:84%
Because my brain started to --
my mind started getting in there

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:38.345 align:middle line:84%
and saying, yeah, but
who do you think you are?

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:42.149 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was counting back
from 30, in those moments

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.285 align:middle line:84%
of peace, you know, in those
moments between thoughts,

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.155 align:middle line:84%
it occurred to me that the
only way I was going to heal is

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.758 align:middle line:90%
if I had divine intervention.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:53.694 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, okay, there is
something divine out there,

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I want help, and I want it now.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So you started to pray?

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.198 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't expect anything.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.468 align:middle line:90%
There was no expectation.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.805 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel warmth
and energy go through my body,

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:08.976 align:middle line:84%
and I also saw gold light, and I
thought, something's happening.

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:13.447 align:middle line:84%
And my next question was,
can I see inside my body?

00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:17.084 align:middle line:84%
And literally, a switch went
on and I could see my spine.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.619 align:middle line:90%
I could see all the vertebrae.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:20.287 align:middle line:84%
I could see the twisted
vertebrae.

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:22.456 align:middle line:90%
I could see inflammation.

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Why?"

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.925 align:middle line:90%
I want to know why.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.962 align:middle line:84%
And this is when all this
information started to pour out.

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:84%
My thought patterns, my beliefs,
they were really negative.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:34.468 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that I could
do what I wanted to do.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:38.138 align:middle line:84%
I would try, but I really
didn't feel like I could.

00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:41.742 align:middle line:84%
I had feelings of rejection
from coming to Australia

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.611 align:middle line:84%
from a country that was
difficult at that moment.

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.947 align:middle line:84%
People didn't like
people from Russia,

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle line:84%
so I was always told go home,
or I never felt accepted.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.788 align:middle line:84%
So all of that -- my
parents were always fighting

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:55.923 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't feel safe.

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:57.024 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel supported.

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.791 align:middle line:84%
I never knew if they
were going to be there.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.329 align:middle line:84%
And then my grandparents
had gone through the war;

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:05.365 align:middle line:84%
most of the members of
the family were killed,

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.101 align:middle line:84%
they suffered atrocious
experiences,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle line:84%
and they never talked
about it for 50 years.

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:14.908 align:middle line:84%
So all of this was in my
body; ancestral memories,

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:17.044 align:middle line:90%
my own cellular memories.

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:20.214 align:middle line:84%
And then I was always
taking on people's energy.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:21.849 align:middle line:90%
And as I was recognizing it,

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:84%
I just kept saying,
"I'm letting this go.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.284 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting this go."

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:25.352 align:middle line:90%
And I was crying --

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.186 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah, definitely.

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:27.521 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: -- and feeling it.

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I think I was so
exhausted, I just fell asleep

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.259 align:middle line:84%
and had the best sleep of
my life, and the next day

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.262 align:middle line:84%
when I wake up, 70 percent
of the pain was gone

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.397 align:middle line:90%
and my spine was straight.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It was as if all the ancestral
pain was dumped into this --

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.206 align:middle line:84%
that body, was the body
you were born with,

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.776 align:middle line:84%
and you absorbed it all and
all and all of it, all of it.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:53.013 align:middle line:84%
And you were able to -- so
when you had that experience

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:84%
of being able to see
inside your body,

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:57.251 align:middle line:84%
can you remember it crystal
clear like it was yesterday?

can't say she was a real friend,

was studying with me --

writing a story, and she came

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.581 align:middle line:84%
over about three weeks after
this, and I was typing,

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%

just looked at her

liver above her head,

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.856 align:middle line:84%

liver -- the only reason I knew,

ask you a question?

my whole life."

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.845 align:middle line:84%

the image changed

her grandfather,

and two years later,

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:05.806 align:middle line:84%
she had tests done,
and it was proven.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.374 align:middle line:90%
I also told her a lot of things

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.476 align:middle line:84%
about her family
that she didn't know.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:13.346 align:middle line:84%

are you doing?"

this new gift

the next day, he was better,

need to learn about this.

So I want to get into, if you
can, examples of the book.

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:90%
So say, for example --

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.768 align:middle line:84%
all right, so the beginning
of the book, I look up

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.203 align:middle line:84%
and I say I have
adrenal fatigue, okay,

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:04.604 align:middle line:84%

adrenals are burnt out,

a remedy here.

did I put you on the spot there?

adrenal fatigue from?

>> IS: There's several reasons.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that we don't
use our energy properly,

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.355 align:middle line:84%
and we drank a lot of
coffee in the morning,

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:27.093 align:middle line:84%
and so we literally switch our
body into unnatural energy,

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:84%
and then we don't listen
and we keep pushing.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:32.365 align:middle line:84%
And, you know --
and adrenal fatigue

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:34.968 align:middle line:84%
and exhaustion is
all about pushing.

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:36.302 align:middle line:90%
It's about frustration.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:39.506 align:middle line:84%
It's about not listening
to your body.

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:41.975 align:middle line:90%
It's about constant stress.

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to go

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:56.623 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: What I love to
teach people is how

00:15:56.623 --> 00:16:00.994 align:middle line:84%
to use really short processes
throughout the day, you know,

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.729 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate themselves.

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.464 align:middle line:84%
And I know we can talk
about it a bit later,

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:08.068 align:middle line:84%
but I think that we always
think that we need one hour

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:84%
or we need a long
time to connect

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:90%
to the body, but we don't.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we just need
30 seconds but we need

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.776 align:middle line:84%
to do it consistently
throughout the day.

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:19.245 align:middle line:84%
So in all the processes
that I'm teaching,

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:21.815 align:middle line:84%
I'm always asking people
to place your hands

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:90%
on that part of the body.

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:26.019 align:middle line:84%
So we would place our hands
on the adrenal glands.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Above --

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Above the kidneys, and we
start to breathe into that area

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.661 align:middle line:90%
and feel what's going on there.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.463 align:middle line:90%
How am I feeling.

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask
people to connect,

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:40.266 align:middle line:90%
breath, feel, ask questions.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.902 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of
questions we would ask is,

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:45.038 align:middle line:90%
what kind of beliefs do I have?

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:46.806 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I have beliefs
that I have

00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:51.711 align:middle line:84%
to keep going no matter what and
I don't allow myself to relax

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:53.379 align:middle line:90%
because my life is so busy.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.514 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because
I've done it --

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: -- you know,
and I'm always, okay,

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.085 align:middle line:90%
take your own lessons.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%
We asked the questions.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.557 align:middle line:84%
And then in every process in
the book, I'm asking for people

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%
to use a releasing statement.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.297 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know about
affirmations, but we must let go

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
of what doesn't work
first before --

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.802 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So when you get the
intuitive message in your body

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:18.538 align:middle line:84%
that you're running too fast
or you're overscheduled,

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:22.207 align:middle line:84%
so do you -- how do you
release something like that?

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: So I always say to
people, we always start

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.912 align:middle line:90%
with divine intelligence.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:27.413 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like
it, you can change it.

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.015 align:middle line:90%
But the reason I use that is

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.784 align:middle line:84%
because there is an
intelligence inside the body

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:35.488 align:middle line:84%
and the universe, and so why
not ask for something divine.

00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:36.122 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Like you had?

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:36.823 align:middle line:90%
That experience

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:37.857 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah, like I had.

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:39.058 align:middle line:90%
And see what happens.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.328 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask, okay,
please help me to release.

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:46.166 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to ask for help
and we need to ask the body,

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:51.437 align:middle line:84%
please let go of my
frustration, my fear, my stress,

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.306 align:middle line:90%
my running around, and so on.

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we say that to ourselves,
out loud, or even in our mind.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.147 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask people to say,
"And all points of view."

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:03.082 align:middle line:84%
Because we get stuck
in a point of view

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:08.388 align:middle line:84%
that this is the only way
that we can have our life be.

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:09.789 align:middle line:90%
And because we believe that,

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:13.159 align:middle line:84%
that's the only way it
shows up -- the hard way.

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.061 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: And then I say,

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.697 align:middle line:84%
"And release all negative
and positive charge."

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:23.269 align:middle line:84%
And charge is a combination of
emotion, belief, and reaction.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:27.106 align:middle line:84%
So we react to things, either
negative charge or positive,

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
where negative meaning, you
know, my body's reacting

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.812 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
why to this person,

00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:35.481 align:middle line:84%
to this experience,
and I can feel sick.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.417 align:middle line:90%
I can feel negativity.

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And positive charge is
what I call overexcited

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.988 align:middle line:90%
and underprepared.

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:44.557 align:middle line:84%
Where we think, okay,
if I just get this job,

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:45.992 align:middle line:90%
my life is going to be perfect.

00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.394 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: If I just do
this, if I get this done,

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:49.896 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be relaxed.

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.264 align:middle line:90%
And then we're not.

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we get disappointed
and we become really negative,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.736 align:middle line:84%
and so positive charge
becomes depression.

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:59.105 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
people let go, cleanse.

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:03.543 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask them to work
-- to repeat the word "clear,"

00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:07.146 align:middle line:84%
and this word is to clear,
it's like a vacuum cleaner.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.548 align:middle line:90%
Let's clean this up --

00:19:08.548 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And it resets everything.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.084 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:12.085 align:middle line:90%
And then I say to them, "Okay,

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:14.921 align:middle line:84%
let's think of something
positive.

00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:17.357 align:middle line:84%
What do we want to
bring into our body?"

00:19:17.357 --> 00:19:20.827 align:middle line:84%
And so they do these
process, and after that,

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.595 align:middle line:90%
I might work with color.

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:25.164 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very easy
to work with color.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:25.999 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I love that color.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.367 align:middle line:90%
I love the color aspects of it.

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.068 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into the
color because it's so beautiful.

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
But just give us an
idea of what it does.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.938 align:middle line:90%
How does the color works?

00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:33.072 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Color works as energy.

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.375 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrational, you know.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.378 align:middle line:84%
And later on maybe I can
show process on how to do it.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:39.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:39.612 align:middle line:90%
I would love that.

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
So -- all right.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.714 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:19:41.714 --> 00:19:43.783 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: So we work with color,
and it's very, very easy.

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:44.851 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.252 align:middle line:84%
It's putting energy
back into our body.

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:49.322 align:middle line:84%
And we are told that we
are 99 percent energy,

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:52.325 align:middle line:84%
so it makes sense
to work with color.

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:56.629 align:middle line:84%
And then I also say to
people, "If there is emotions,

00:19:56.629 --> 00:19:59.098 align:middle line:84%
then we need to work with some
of these emotions and we need

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:02.368 align:middle line:84%
to release the negative emotions
and put in the positive,"

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.904 align:middle line:84%
and I also put that
information in the book.

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:08.207 align:middle line:84%
And even in each process, you
are told, these are the colors,

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.276 align:middle line:84%
these are the emotions
that you can work with.

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:14.681 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to keep going
back and forth in the book.

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:15.948 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: I think this is great.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.918 align:middle line:84%
You also have a little aspect
in here of, so it's kind

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:21.754 align:middle line:84%
of Louise Hay, you can
hear your life-ish.

00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:26.559 align:middle line:84%
You state the common cold, and
here's some of the symptoms

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.896 align:middle line:84%
of it and then here's
what to do to address it.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.397 align:middle line:90%
Explain that a little bit.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.198 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.233 align:middle line:90%
I really felt that I wanted

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.669 align:middle line:84%
to give information a little
bit more than Louise Hay

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:84%
because her book was written
in like 25 or 30 years ago,

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:43.176 align:middle line:84%
so there's a lot more that's
been available since then.

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:46.779 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the way that I got
my information was literally

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.148 align:middle line:84%
tuning into thousands
of people and writing

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:90%
down this information, you know.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.685 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, she's
amazing, brilliant,

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:55.621 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go a
little bit further now.

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:58.391 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is,
again, to look up something

00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
like a common cold, and then go,
what am I going to do about it?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.997 align:middle line:84%
Okay. I need to go to the
section on chest and throat.

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:05.765 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:06.699 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: So work with that.

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:09.002 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
same time, again,

00:21:09.002 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to work with color.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.875 align:middle line:84%
And the best color is orange
because it cleanses the chest.

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.043 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:19.879 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: And also in
different parts of the book,

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:23.716 align:middle line:84%
I give you pressure point,
you know, like where do I --

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:25.952 align:middle line:84%
which point do I need
to press to help me.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:84%
Because I really feel that
we need to touch the body.

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:32.392 align:middle line:84%
Or I might work with mudras,
which are basically yoga

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:34.827 align:middle line:84%
of the hands, and they've
been around for a long time.

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:38.398 align:middle line:84%
And so each mudra gives you
that opportunity to connect

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:40.967 align:middle line:84%
to your breath, to connect
to your body, to cleanse.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.202 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: An example
of a mudra would be?

00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:45.605 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: One of my favorites,
speaking of the cold,

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:48.107 align:middle line:84%
this is the one for the
cold and weight loss --

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:49.208 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, perfect.

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:50.476 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: -- together.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:55.782 align:middle line:84%
So you bring your hands
together, and one thumb goes up,

00:21:55.782 --> 00:21:59.118 align:middle line:84%
another thumb, the index
fingers are touching each other.

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:00.286 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: So -- and it
doesn't matter which hand.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle line:84%
And then you just hold this
mudra around your chest

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
in a very relaxed way from
two minutes to 15 minutes,

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.163 align:middle line:84%
depends on what you're
going through.

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:12.231 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
cleanses your sinuses,

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:17.103 align:middle line:84%
it activates your
metabolism, it burns fat,

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:19.605 align:middle line:84%
it re-energizes the
body, and it's amazing.

00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:84%
So what I say to people is, do
that and combine it, let's say,

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:25.211 align:middle line:90%
with a color like orange.

00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:28.381 align:middle line:84%
So I might close my eyes,
visualize orange light going

00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:30.983 align:middle line:90%
into my chest and cleansing it.

00:22:30.983 --> 00:22:36.489 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I'm doing
it physically with this mudra,

00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:38.224 align:middle line:90%
and then I might, you know,

00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:84%
visualize how my cells
are regenerating,

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:46.799 align:middle line:84%
how negative energy is coming
out, my metabolism is working.

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:90%
If I'm working on weight loss,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.139 align:middle line:84%
I visualize myself becoming
the way that I want to be.

00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:53.906 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wonderful.

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.208 align:middle line:90%
Where did you learn this?

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:58.478 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: I wanted to study
everything, you know,

00:22:58.478 --> 00:23:01.981 align:middle line:84%
so I went to study the Eastern
philosophy and the Western.

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:04.917 align:middle line:84%
And also intuitively,
I just receive a lot

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:08.454 align:middle line:84%
of information tuning
into people and myself.

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:09.856 align:middle line:90%
I receive.

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:14.861 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to combine
everything, but what I found was

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
that Eastern philosophy
didn't always work for people

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.899 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world,
because we're busy.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:20.933 align:middle line:90%
We're running around.

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:22.435 align:middle line:84%
We don't have eight
hours to meditate.

00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:23.069 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, right.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:23.903 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:25.505 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Or even one sometimes.

00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:28.007 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to -- and
I have a busy life,

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:30.243 align:middle line:90%
and I really want to be well.

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:32.445 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to combine
all this so I could be

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:33.813 align:middle line:90%
on the plane and doing this.

00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.982 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look too weird.

00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:39.352 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, yeah, I'm just,
you know, holding my hands

00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:40.987 align:middle line:84%
in a weird position
but nobody cares..

00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:43.689 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Speaking of intuitive,
when you are in situations

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:84%
like on a plane or in
busy airports or traveling

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.561 align:middle line:90%
or even one-on-ones with people,

00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.464 align:middle line:84%
do you pick up intuitively
what's going

00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:52.431 align:middle line:90%
on with the other person?

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.699 align:middle line:90%
And how do you close that down

00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:56.168 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get
overwhelmed and blown out?

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.538 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Well, at the beginning
I didn't know how to do that,

00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:02.074 align:middle line:84%
so I would cross the road
and just hear everything.

00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:03.709 align:middle line:84%
I would know what
the person was going

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:05.878 align:middle line:84%
through just crossing the
road and I was thinking,

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I've got too much information.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.414 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Go crazy, yeah.

00:24:08.414 --> 00:24:10.883 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: At one point, I
realized that, you know,

00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
the way we are made is
that we can direct things

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.054 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves, we can ask.

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So I actually said to
myself, you know what,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.962 align:middle line:84%
I need that intelligence inside
of me to only allow me to tune

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:26.599 align:middle line:84%
in when I want to,
when it's appropriate.

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:29.902 align:middle line:84%
Because at the same time, people
were scared to be around me

00:24:29.902 --> 00:24:31.103 align:middle line:84%
because they would
say, oh, my God.

00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:32.138 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:32.972 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes, yes.

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:33.639 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: And I'm like, no, no, no.

00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:90%
It's fine, you know.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.978 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned how to
switch that on and off.

00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:42.014 align:middle line:84%
And in my book "The
Secret of Life Wellness,"

00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:46.452 align:middle line:84%
I talk about protection and --
but not from fear, but from --

00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:48.487 align:middle line:84%
it's the same as
wearing clothes.

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:51.023 align:middle line:84%
We need to wear --
unless you're in Spain --

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:52.091 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:53.159 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible]

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:54.994 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: We need to wear
clothes, you know,

00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:57.229 align:middle line:90%
just because that's what we do.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
with protection.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:03.169 align:middle line:84%
It's how do we connect and not
take on other people's energy

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:04.937 align:middle line:90%
and not give our own to them

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:06.572 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
you don't feel good.

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.976 align:middle line:84%
Well, Inna has a lot
of great suggestions

00:25:09.976 --> 00:25:11.077 align:middle line:90%
for tools for busy people.

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:12.378 align:middle line:90%
So take a look at this.

00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: You wake up in the
morning and you are going --

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle line:84%
you decide -- you realize,
I have a lot to do.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:26.459 align:middle line:84%
So you start communicating both
with a universal intelligence,

00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:29.996 align:middle line:84%
and with the intelligence
of your brain and your body,

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:33.833 align:middle line:84%
and you start asking empowering
questions like, all right --

00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:36.535 align:middle line:84%
and this is an example
-- "Divine intelligent,

00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.404 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot to do today.

00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:40.139 align:middle line:90%
Please help me.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:41.841 align:middle line:90%
Please support me.

00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:47.113 align:middle line:84%
Please allow that this happens
with ease, flow, and grace.

00:25:47.113 --> 00:25:51.951 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to get everything done
that I need to get done today,

00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:54.153 align:middle line:90%
but with ease and joy.

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:58.424 align:middle line:84%
Let me be enthusiastic about
the work I need to do."

00:25:58.424 --> 00:25:59.759 align:middle line:90%
But let's say, you know,

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
you're really open,
you feel really good.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.295 align:middle line:90%
All right, "Divine intelligent,

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:06.232 align:middle line:84%
show me something
fantastic today.

00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:10.369 align:middle line:84%
Help me to have the most
greatest, most vibrant,

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:16.042 align:middle line:84%
most exciting day
that I can have today.

00:26:16.042 --> 00:26:19.111 align:middle line:90%
Give me some positive surprises.

00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:24.417 align:middle line:84%
Show me how today I can receive
more abundance into my life.

00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:28.554 align:middle line:84%
Show me how I can feel even
better than I feel now.

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:31.791 align:middle line:90%
Give me energy.

00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:37.663 align:middle line:84%
Help me to experience my life in
the most vibrant positive way.

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:39.799 align:middle line:84%
Bring to me people who
are going to inspire me."

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.702 align:middle line:84%
[Gong] And what I say
to people in terms

00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:46.439 align:middle line:84%
of their divine intelligence
is, you know,

00:26:46.439 --> 00:26:49.275 align:middle line:84%
and you probably noticed
this in every several process

00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
in the book, you start with
divine healing intelligence,

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:57.249 align:middle line:84%
is that we have access to this
incredible divinity, you know,

00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and why should we do it
on our own, you know.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.954 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:84%
It's a struggle, you
know, but when we connect

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:07.293 align:middle line:84%
to something higher, we
just feel that, you know,

00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:10.896 align:middle line:84%
being taking care of or
protected or, you know, safer.

00:27:10.896 --> 00:27:12.131 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So since we're on the upper
body theme here about --

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.436 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about,
well, adrenal fatigue leading

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to thyroid issues, so
they tend to be linked.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.076 align:middle line:84%
What types of techniques
can you suggest to people --

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:27.513 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's one of the
most under diagnosed illnesses

00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:30.382 align:middle line:84%
in people right now is --
it's a slippery one, too,

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:33.152 align:middle line:84%
because you can't really
identify it as easily.

00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:34.887 align:middle line:84%
And the ranges are a
little bit large right now.

00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:37.723 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
about or what suggestions

00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:39.391 align:middle line:84%
or techniques can
you offer to people

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:40.926 align:middle line:90%
who have thyroid imbalances?

00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:42.962 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Well, it's
really interesting

00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:45.931 align:middle line:84%
because I've met a lot of women
who've used "The Secret Language

00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:48.601 align:middle line:84%
of Your Body" and used
the process for thyroid --

00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh, there's
a specific category?

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.202 align:middle line:90%
Great. Great.

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:51.403 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.305 align:middle line:84%
-- and have told me,
because I haven't had that,

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
so I'm always like, oh,
tell me if it works.

00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And even in the last month,
several women have said to me,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.481 align:middle line:90%
I've used the process

00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:04.917 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
thyroid problems anymore,

00:28:04.917 --> 00:28:08.187 align:middle line:84%
or I have completed --
my medication is very,

00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:84%
very small now compared
to what it was.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.691 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying to people,
firstly, besides the processes,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.468 align:middle line:84%
we need to communicate, not
just talk, but communicate.

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:26.238 align:middle line:84%
Because thyroid issues
are all about suppression

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:29.708 align:middle line:84%
and not saying things
that you need to say.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:33.078 align:middle line:84%
So whilst the processes are
great and regenerate body,

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.747 align:middle line:84%
I really want people
to understand it's

00:28:34.747 --> 00:28:36.315 align:middle line:90%
about how you live your life.

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:39.618 align:middle line:84%
This is why I wanted to
write about life wellness

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:41.854 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
just the process.

00:28:41.854 --> 00:28:45.825 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the process,
you know, blue is a great color

00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:50.229 align:middle line:84%
for your throat and anything
to do with the throat,

00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:53.365 align:middle line:84%
but I still think that
orange is very, very powerful

00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:84%
for thyroid issues;
orange and green.

00:28:56.268 --> 00:29:00.706 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to always connect
to the throat when we are

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:04.677 align:middle line:84%
in the thyroid, when we
are asking questions.

00:29:04.677 --> 00:29:08.047 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the kinds of
questions we need to ask are,

00:29:08.047 --> 00:29:10.082 align:middle line:90%
what beliefs do I have the?

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:11.083 align:middle line:90%
What's my point of view?

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.518 align:middle line:90%
What emotions?

00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:14.153 align:middle line:90%
Where are they coming from?

00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:16.622 align:middle line:84%
Because very often we think
that the emotion is coming

00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:18.924 align:middle line:90%
from right now and it's not.

00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:21.227 align:middle line:90%
What memories do I have here?

00:29:21.227 --> 00:29:23.996 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important in
terms of cellular memory

00:29:23.996 --> 00:29:27.733 align:middle line:84%
that once we recognize
in memory, we change it.

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:29.034 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:30.803 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we
completely change it,

00:29:30.803 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
but we need to adjust
it in a very small way.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.741 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I change the color.

00:29:35.741 --> 00:29:39.011 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in my memory I wasn't
able to speak to someone,

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:42.982 align:middle line:84%
and now I imagine myself
speaking to that person.

00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:44.049 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:47.253 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, just take
for example thyroid,

00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:51.257 align:middle line:84%
and I love how you're empowering
us to self-diagnose and to start

00:29:51.257 --> 00:29:53.359 align:middle line:84%
and begin our self-healing
process.

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:56.161 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying to put your
hands on your thyroid and say,

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:59.164 align:middle line:84%
what are my beliefs
around thyroid?

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.399 align:middle line:90%
What are -- and --

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: My throat.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.167 align:middle line:90%
Not my thyroid.

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:02.968 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, okay.

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: What's inside there.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.006 align:middle line:90%
I want the body to show you.

00:30:07.006 --> 00:30:10.075 align:middle line:84%
This is why you need to take
time, you need to breathe

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:14.747 align:middle line:84%
and relax first, and then
start to ask, what's holding --

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:15.881 align:middle line:90%
what about holding there?

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:18.984 align:middle line:84%
Who am I not speaking to
that I need to speak to?

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:21.754 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I talk about
sometimes we have chains

00:30:21.754 --> 00:30:24.323 align:middle line:90%
around our throat literally --

00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:25.357 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Ancestral?

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:27.793 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are these
past-life type of --

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:29.395 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Could be combinations.

00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:30.596 align:middle line:90%
Could be a combination.

00:30:30.596 --> 00:30:32.364 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] go into past
life, it's very possible,

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of --
it's not just women,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:84%
people in past lives were not
able to express themselves

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:42.007 align:middle line:84%
because if they did,
they would die.

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:42.808 align:middle line:90%
They would be killed.

00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:43.976 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:45.611 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Or maybe they
were killed for doing it,

00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:48.814 align:middle line:84%
and so they have this memory
of their -- in their throat --

00:30:48.814 --> 00:30:49.815 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds a little --

00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No, no.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.185 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it several
times, yeah, absolutely.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.722 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of energy
around throats, around necks,

00:30:56.722 --> 00:31:00.693 align:middle line:84%
around thyroid, and it's just
one of those growing epidemics

00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:03.228 align:middle line:84%
so I thought we could talk
about it on a healing level.

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:04.363 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:06.165 align:middle line:84%
It in my second book, I
talk about past lives,

00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:10.569 align:middle line:84%
and I give you a process on
how to delve into past lives

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and what can be there, because
not only can we have problems

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.111 align:middle line:84%
or issues, but we might also
make vows and agreements.

00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:22.514 align:middle line:84%
And a vow is stronger
than a belief.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:24.216 align:middle line:90%
Just think about a wedding vow.

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.151 align:middle line:90%
True. True.

00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:28.954 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: It's like, I am going to
spend my life with this person.

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:30.255 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:32.791 align:middle line:84%
So vows and agreements,
soul agreements --

00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:33.892 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Your word.

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:34.693 align:middle line:90%
Very strong.

00:31:34.693 --> 00:31:35.627 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.563 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful and
drive our lives.

00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:40.866 align:middle line:84%
So when we let go -- and often
I will ask people, "Okay,

00:31:40.866 --> 00:31:44.436 align:middle line:84%
if you could see something,
what would it look like?"

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:48.007 align:middle line:84%
And let's say they do see a
chain, and then I'll say, "Okay,

00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:50.876 align:middle line:84%
visual a purple fire
in front of you."

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:53.979 align:middle line:84%
Because purple is the color
that dissolves energy.

00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:58.117 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to literally
take this chain and the lock,

00:31:58.117 --> 00:32:00.652 align:middle line:84%
let's get a key to
unlock your throat

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.788 align:middle line:90%
so that you can communicate."

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:05.758 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people tell me,
"You've given me back my voice."

00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:06.458 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:07.826 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:11.397 align:middle line:84%
I also noticed that you have
a lot of energy in your hands.

00:32:11.397 --> 00:32:16.468 align:middle line:84%
And people, we all, have
healing powers in our own hands.

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:18.003 align:middle line:84%
How did you get in
touch with that

00:32:18.003 --> 00:32:19.238 align:middle line:90%
and how do you teach people?

00:32:19.238 --> 00:32:21.273 align:middle line:84%
Because you say, put
your hands on the area.

00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:22.875 align:middle line:90%
Put your hands on the area.

00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach us to use our
hands as our own healing tools?

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Well, firstly, there
is a chakra in the hands

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that we already have, so
everybody has this capacity.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.955 align:middle line:84%
The way I teach people
is very simple and I try

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.757 align:middle line:90%
to combine color with it.

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:40.859 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, rub
your hands together.

00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:44.997 align:middle line:84%
And you rub your hands together
for about 30 to 40 seconds,

00:32:44.997 --> 00:32:46.665 align:middle line:84%
and even as you're rubbing
your hands together,

00:32:46.665 --> 00:32:50.369 align:middle line:84%
you're healing your body because
you have acupressure points all

00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:51.336 align:middle line:90%
over your hands.

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:52.404 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: They're also heating up.

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:52.938 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:54.339 align:middle line:90%
Heating up.

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:56.975 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask people to place
their hands next to each other

00:32:56.975 --> 00:33:01.713 align:middle line:84%
and start to feel that energy,
because this is what energy is.

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.515 align:middle line:90%
They feel a tingling sensation.

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I might say, let's
take color red and visualize it.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.924 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't visualize it,
look at the card, you know,

00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:15.761 align:middle line:84%
or look at, you know, have
something red in front of you.

00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:17.463 align:middle line:90%
And so then I'll say, okay,

00:33:17.463 --> 00:33:20.799 align:middle line:84%
let's imagine this big
ball of red energy.

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:21.633 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:23.068 align:middle line:90%
Is it hot or cold?

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:23.969 align:middle line:90%
What are you feeling?

00:33:23.969 --> 00:33:25.637 align:middle line:90%
Is it heavy or light?

00:33:25.637 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:84%
How far can I go
with this color?

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:31.276 align:middle line:84%
And then I might even ask
them program the color

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:32.711 align:middle line:90%
because it's speaking of energy.

00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
When you have thyroid issues or
when you have adrenal issues,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.382 align:middle line:84%
you need energy, so
I'll say to them, okay,

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.084 align:middle line:90%
I want you to imagine

00:33:39.084 --> 00:33:41.353 align:middle line:84%
that you're amplifying
this red energy --

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:43.589 align:middle line:84%
because red is a
color for energy.

00:33:43.589 --> 00:33:46.692 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to send
this energy literally

00:33:46.692 --> 00:33:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and breathe it in.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.964 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm doing it in
terms of my adrenal glands,

00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:56.969 align:middle line:84%
I will send it to my back and
maybe to my front and maybe

00:33:56.969 --> 00:34:00.038 align:middle line:84%
to my throat, and I will
be breathing that color in

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.574 align:middle line:84%
and visualizing it
going into my body,

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:04.977 align:middle line:84%
but also sending
it with my hands.

00:34:04.977 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll place my
hands, you know, for a minute

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.849 align:middle line:90%
on that part of the body

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:13.017 align:middle line:84%
and I'll repeat the word
clear, clear, clear.

00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:17.122 align:middle line:84%
And the word clear also helps
to release any stuckness

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:18.990 align:middle line:84%
in your nervous system
and your brain.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.359 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is a great exercise.

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.126 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for the example
that you just gave.

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.062 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
at another example here

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of another healing technique
that you can do on your own.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.132 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:29.935 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: So let's say that
you have a headache.

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:32.403 align:middle line:84%
You read about it and you
go, all right, headaches;

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:35.007 align:middle line:84%
so to do with stress or
overwhelming, tiredness,

00:34:35.007 --> 00:34:36.575 align:middle line:90%
seriousness, too much going on.

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:90%
So just by reading this,

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I already know I
need to slow down.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.682 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's getting
headaches again and again,

00:34:43.682 --> 00:34:46.151 align:middle line:90%
they have to slow down.

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.586 align:middle line:90%
They have to release the stress.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:51.923 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a process
in the book in the section

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:90%
of emotions to do a stress.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.263 align:middle line:84%
So I might go to that section,
we do the process in the head,

00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:00.399 align:middle line:90%
but you can go further.

00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:02.267 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you go, all right.

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:03.902 align:middle line:90%
But what else is in the head?

00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:05.404 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the brain.

00:35:05.404 --> 00:35:10.842 align:middle line:84%
So then do the process
on the brain as well.

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:13.545 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in the same day,
maybe on the next day,

00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:17.182 align:middle line:84%
maybe on the same day, depends
of how fast you want to heal.

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:19.184 align:middle line:90%
So you connect things.

00:35:19.184 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You might go, actually, you
know, it's in the middle

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of my head, so maybe I'll do
process in the hypothalamus

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
it is, you know.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.029 align:middle line:84%
And since hypothalamus
is connected

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:34.666 align:middle line:90%
to our balance, why not.

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:38.437 align:middle line:84%
You might go, pineal and
pituitary glands are there

00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:40.873 align:middle line:84%
if you have a headache
around here.

00:35:40.873 --> 00:35:42.274 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:35:42.274 --> 00:35:44.209 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and read about
the pineal and pituitary gland

00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:45.611 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
do the processes

00:35:45.611 --> 00:35:49.314 align:middle line:84%
because they are connected to
hormones and hormonal balance,

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:51.617 align:middle line:84%
and we want the body
to be balanced.

00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:52.551 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:35:52.551 --> 00:35:53.852 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great
way to explain

00:35:53.852 --> 00:35:55.454 align:middle line:90%
that whole idea of color.

00:35:55.454 --> 00:35:57.422 align:middle line:84%
Where did you get the
insights around color

00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:59.625 align:middle line:84%
and how did you pull
it all together?

00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:03.428 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to be a
really important point for you.

00:36:03.428 --> 00:36:05.097 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: I always loved color.

00:36:05.097 --> 00:36:07.733 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was something
that you need

to feel good in your life.

00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:13.305 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'd always want to
wear colorful clothes, you know,

00:36:13.305 --> 00:36:15.674 align:middle line:84%

when I would wear color --

Russia you do this?

was really little then.

I just remember that
I always loved color.

00:36:24.383 --> 00:36:27.452 align:middle line:84%
And but, yeah, I remember
my mom left one time

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:30.689 align:middle line:84%
and I was maybe four years
old and I was so excited

00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:33.091 align:middle line:84%
because I could choose
my clothes.

00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:34.693 align:middle line:90%
And my dad would say, "Okay,

00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:35.794 align:middle line:84%
these are the clothes
your mom chose."

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:37.796 align:middle line:90%

Free rein.

00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:46.505 align:middle line:84%
And what I found also when
I gave birth to my children,

00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:49.875 align:middle line:84%
they were really small, and
I wanted to know how to work

00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:52.177 align:middle line:90%
with them in a very gentle way.

00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:56.248 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember my son,
he had a skin condition

00:36:56.248 --> 00:36:58.784 align:middle line:84%
when he was a little baby,
and I tried everything.

00:36:58.784 --> 00:37:00.052 align:middle line:90%
I put on creams.

00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:01.253 align:middle line:90%
I did everything.

It wouldn't go; like eczema.

you know what?

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.225 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
this color healing.

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:10.095 align:middle line:84%
And I think I worked
with yellow and green,

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.764 align:middle line:84%
and I just rubbed my hands
together like I showed before,

00:37:12.764 --> 00:37:16.902 align:middle line:84%
and I sent this green light
and yellow light to his skin,

00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:18.637 align:middle line:84%
and within one day
it disappeared.

00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:20.772 align:middle line:84%

And then when my children
were little and growing up,

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:31.383 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to teach them every
night about meditation,

00:37:31.383 --> 00:37:35.287 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, color is the
easiest way that I can start.

00:37:35.287 --> 00:37:36.088 align:middle line:90%

00:37:36.088 --> 00:37:36.855 align:middle line:90%

"Pink hearts everywhere.

00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:50.068 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, "Green,
let's work with green.

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.303 align:middle line:90%
What's green for?

as such a serious,
serious thing.

when I was 20, I needed fun.

I needed joy.

she was dying and she had --

that I was going to
teach her about healing.

00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:35.267 align:middle line:84%
It was so imaginative
and creative.

00:40:35.267 --> 00:40:37.602 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Each time
you pick a card,

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:41.039 align:middle line:84%
you will not only receive
an inspiring message,

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:44.976 align:middle line:84%
but also have an opportunity
to do a single process

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:47.913 align:middle line:84%
that can help you
attract success,

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:53.018 align:middle line:84%
uncover your brilliance,
free yourself from pain,

00:40:53.018 --> 00:40:57.188 align:middle line:84%
learn to scan your body,
create a balanced life,

00:40:57.188 --> 00:41:02.527 align:middle line:84%
attract a great relationship,
and many others.

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:04.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Color not only makes
you feel more confident,

00:41:04.496 --> 00:41:06.631 align:middle line:84%
but it makes you
look more confident.

00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:10.602 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: I hope you enjoy
using this card deck as much

00:41:10.602 --> 00:41:14.406 align:middle line:84%
as I enjoyed researching
and writing it.

00:41:14.406 --> 00:41:16.341 align:middle line:84%
>> I really like the way
that Inna's put it together

00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:17.409 align:middle line:90%
because it shows us

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:20.245 align:middle line:84%
that well-being is
our divine birthright.

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:23.582 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Please share this
card deck with your family,

00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:27.052 align:middle line:84%
your children, your
colleagues and everyone you know

00:41:27.052 --> 00:41:30.221 align:middle line:84%
and bring more color
into your life.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.259 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:35.627 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: All right.

00:41:35.627 --> 00:41:36.628 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to play with
this a little bit and use some

00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:37.929 align:middle line:84%
of these beautiful
color cards here.

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:41.099 align:middle line:84%
We have them with us
here in studio of --

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.802 align:middle line:84%
and do a little bit of healing
energy with these color cards.

00:41:43.802 --> 00:41:45.203 align:middle line:90%
I think it's so important,

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:49.074 align:middle line:84%
and I know specifically Gaiam is
very focused on color as well.

00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.843 align:middle line:84%
They choose colors
intentionally for healing.

00:41:51.843 --> 00:41:55.814 align:middle line:84%
Purple is one of the colors
that Gaiam particularly loves.

00:41:55.814 --> 00:41:59.751 align:middle line:84%
So here's four of the
purple cards you have here.

00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:02.387 align:middle line:90%
Why so many different ones?

00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:04.222 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's even plum, yeah.

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:05.156 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:08.627 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Because I
felt that each --

00:42:08.627 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, we can have
generalizations about color

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.568 align:middle line:84%
or we can have very
specific energy of color.

00:42:16.568 --> 00:42:20.705 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted people to
have this deck of cards

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that could give them more
specific ways of working.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.047 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, for instance,
you've got lavender here

00:42:29.047 --> 00:42:34.286 align:middle line:84%
and it's about -- it allows you
to connect to your mind, body,

00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:37.155 align:middle line:84%
and soul, but to align
them together, you know.

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:40.025 align:middle line:90%
And then here we've got plum,

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:42.394 align:middle line:84%
and it's about overcoming
your challenges

00:42:42.394 --> 00:42:45.764 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you a
different type of energy.

00:42:45.764 --> 00:42:49.401 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like this
passion to succeed.

00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:51.636 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: A deeper type of -- yeah.

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:52.604 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:42:52.604 --> 00:42:54.005 align:middle line:84%
You know, and indigo
here we have,

00:42:54.005 --> 00:42:57.442 align:middle line:84%
and it is about improving your
vision, because purple colors,

00:42:57.442 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
in particular indigo,
is about your third eye,

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:03.248 align:middle line:84%
about your intuition,
but it's amazing

00:43:03.248 --> 00:43:06.017 align:middle line:90%
in terms of your eyesight.

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:06.584 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, wow.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.185 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:43:07.185 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.954 align:middle line:84%
So, you know -- and
anything to do with the head.

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So if you have -- if
you're maybe working in front

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.759 align:middle line:84%
of your computer a lot and
you put up the indigo card

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.962 align:middle line:84%
around the computer area, and
you look at that every now

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:20.465 align:middle line:84%
and then as opposed to the
busyness on the screen,

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.001 align:middle line:84%
you can soothe your eyes
a little bit that way?

00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:24.269 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yes.

00:43:24.269 --> 00:43:26.004 align:middle line:84%
And also, you can rub your
hands together, you know,

00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:29.941 align:middle line:84%
visualize the color, and then
put it just over your eyes,

00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:34.546 align:middle line:84%
or if you need to concentrate,
you can massage in the middle

00:43:34.546 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of your forehead where we have
the pineal and pituitary glands,

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.987 align:middle line:84%
and you just massage it for
about 30 seconds to a minute,

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:45.824 align:middle line:84%
and visualize that
color, or just look at it,

00:43:45.824 --> 00:43:48.693 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have a huge difference.

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:50.095 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What about you
just mentioned focus,

00:43:50.095 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was something I
was just thinking about.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:55.567 align:middle line:84%
Is there a specific color
that you can help resonate

00:43:55.567 --> 00:43:57.535 align:middle line:84%
or bring yourself into
the present moment

00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and to focus with?

00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yes.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:43:59.771 align:middle line:90%
Yellow.

00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:00.605 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Let's find that.

00:44:00.605 --> 00:44:01.339 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.807 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah, yellow.

00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:07.545 align:middle line:84%
I love yellow because to me it's
always happy and shiny and --

00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:84%
yeah, lemon and --
connecting your body.

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:13.485 align:middle line:84%
And this one is about accessing
your innovative thinking

00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:17.622 align:middle line:84%
because yellow allows you
to go beyond your mind

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:19.791 align:middle line:90%
and into your creativity.

00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:23.261 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we can rub our hands
together, visualize yellow,

00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:28.466 align:middle line:84%
and literally send that into our
brains, send it into our head.

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:33.037 align:middle line:84%
We can do the same thing with
yellow as purple and just --

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:35.673 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I will actually
ask people to send yellow

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.776 align:middle line:90%
through their whole body.

00:44:37.776 --> 00:44:41.012 align:middle line:84%
And if you need to
concentrate and be more present,

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.282 align:middle line:84%
you always want the energy
to come from up, down.

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So purifying --

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:45.917 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:47.318 align:middle line:90%
So we are grounded.

00:44:47.318 --> 00:44:50.488 align:middle line:84%
If I want more upliftment, then
I will bring the energy up --

00:44:50.488 --> 00:44:51.055 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:51.823 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:44:51.823 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: -- through my body.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:53.958 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: All right.

00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:55.827 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
a few of these color cards,

00:44:55.827 --> 00:44:57.595 align:middle line:84%
because I think they're
just visually beautiful.

00:44:57.595 --> 00:44:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put them
up full screen here

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.231 align:middle line:84%
so that you can take
a look at this.

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:03.334 align:middle line:90%
Here's brown and here's pearl.

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:04.869 align:middle line:90%
So you mentioned grounding.

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:05.703 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:06.671 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So this is the color --

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:07.972 align:middle line:84%
and that's such a
pretty picture.

00:45:07.972 --> 00:45:11.676 align:middle line:84%
It's just soil, but it is
really a pretty picture.

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:14.445 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Well, you know, I
think it's about grounding

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:19.083 align:middle line:84%
but making things grow as well,
and it's also about boundaries.

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Not the boundaries we create
where we don't allow ourselves

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.756 align:middle line:84%
to grow, but boundaries
where we say, you know what?

00:45:24.756 --> 00:45:26.658 align:middle line:90%
This is how to love myself.

00:45:26.658 --> 00:45:28.393 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's a great idea.

00:45:28.393 --> 00:45:30.862 align:middle line:84%
So this -- so, again,
resonating with this color.

00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:33.198 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at these as
you're going through this show

00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:34.532 align:middle line:90%
and see what resonates with you.

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:35.733 align:middle line:90%
Pearl.

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.702 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Pearl is connecting
to the divine energy.

00:45:37.702 --> 00:45:41.005 align:middle line:84%
It's about purity,
it's about clarity,

00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:44.709 align:middle line:90%
it's about expansion, divinity.

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:45.276 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:46.177 align:middle line:90%
Okay. All right.

00:45:46.177 --> 00:45:46.911 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:48.112 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned lavender.

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:48.947 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:45:48.947 --> 00:45:50.582 align:middle line:90%
Connecting mind, body, and soul.

00:45:50.582 --> 00:45:53.751 align:middle line:84%
Because so often we think
with our minds, but, you know,

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:57.055 align:middle line:84%
our soul is somewhere else,
a body is not connected

00:45:57.055 --> 00:46:01.593 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, how do we bring
that connection together?

00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:03.094 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In one of your
meditations you talk

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:06.030 align:middle line:84%
about getting connected
with your body as one

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.234 align:middle line:84%
of the beginning stages
of any type of healing

00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:12.303 align:middle line:90%
or any type of meditation.

00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:13.838 align:middle line:84%
Would this color help
with that connection?

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:15.206 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Definitely.

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:18.343 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can even imagine,
how would I imagine my mind?

00:46:18.343 --> 00:46:20.278 align:middle line:84%
How would I imagine
my body and my soul?

00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:24.782 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, let's connect
with this color, the three.

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:25.717 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:46:25.717 --> 00:46:27.252 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
one year, amber.

00:46:27.252 --> 00:46:31.155 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Amber is the
color of creativity.

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.523 align:middle line:90%
It's allowing ourselves

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:35.393 align:middle line:84%
to be more creative,
to be more joyful.

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:37.962 align:middle line:90%
And I love this color card

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:40.765 align:middle line:84%
because it's as if
we're shining.

00:46:40.765 --> 00:46:42.467 align:middle line:90%
You know, there is this --

00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:43.301 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, it's beautiful.

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:44.702 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: -- light that comes out.

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:49.374 align:middle line:84%
We are gold and we are orange
and we are [inaudible], and we,

00:46:49.374 --> 00:46:52.543 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have so much
of this life within us.

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.812 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Do you ever associate
these colors with the seasons?

00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:56.547 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
amber and fall --

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:57.382 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:46:57.382 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: -- associated together.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.085 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good relationship --

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:02.554 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yes.

00:47:02.554 --> 00:47:05.823 align:middle line:84%
It's good to associate it in any
way that supports you inside,

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:07.792 align:middle line:90%
because all of this, it's like,

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:10.795 align:middle line:84%
how can I have more
strength in my body.

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:13.464 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I love fall because
it does, the changing

00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of the seasons, it's
getting cooler,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.069 align:middle line:84%
and it also is a
beautiful color display.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:19.637 align:middle line:84%
Nature has a paintbrush
during fall.

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:20.705 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: I agree.

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:22.006 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Fall and spring
are my favorites.

00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:23.408 align:middle line:90%
Gold.

00:47:23.408 --> 00:47:26.811 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Gold is one of the most
powerful colors in general,

00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:29.714 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm always
saying, use it wisely.

00:47:29.714 --> 00:47:31.115 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: You know, because it can
overwhelm your nervous system,

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.321 align:middle line:84%
but it's also one of the
colors that heals anything.

00:47:36.321 --> 00:47:37.722 align:middle line:90%
So you combine it.

00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:39.958 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I wanted to
combine it with a little bit

00:47:39.958 --> 00:47:43.528 align:middle line:84%
of white, you know, because
white and gold are really,

00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:84%
really powerful, and this
is one of the best ways

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.567 align:middle line:84%
to protect yourself but
also to allow abundance.

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:52.003 align:middle line:84%
This is the color -- this
is the card for abundance.

00:47:52.003 --> 00:47:56.407 align:middle line:84%
Let's allow a lot of abundance,
and, you know, great things,

00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:84%
great opportunities, miracles
to come into our lives.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.246 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now -- and the
green card you mentioned is

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:02.947 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:03.614 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you said?

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:04.882 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: For healing.

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:07.118 align:middle line:84%
And this one is about connecting
to the nervous system.

00:48:07.118 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Because green regenerates
and revives your body,

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.159 align:middle line:84%
so you can meditate
with it, but it's not --

00:48:15.159 --> 00:48:17.228 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of like,
it gives you energy.

00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:21.132 align:middle line:84%
It gives you an ability
to regenerate,

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:23.835 align:middle line:84%
and it also reconnects
the nervous systems,

00:48:23.835 --> 00:48:25.036 align:middle line:90%
you know, the pathways.

00:48:25.036 --> 00:48:26.371 align:middle line:90%
It creates new pathways.

00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:28.373 align:middle line:90%
It's great for back pain.

00:48:28.373 --> 00:48:31.209 align:middle line:84%
One of the best colors for
back pain, for anything to do

00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:33.478 align:middle line:90%
with bones, and for the heart.

00:48:33.478 --> 00:48:35.113 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And looking at
these three green cards

00:48:35.113 --> 00:48:38.583 align:middle line:84%
that I have here,
aqua, jade, and green,

00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:42.186 align:middle line:84%
and these are just great
cards to put up in your room.

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:43.021 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:44.622 align:middle line:90%
Next to your computer, anywhere.

00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:48.893 align:middle line:84%
Just anytime you see
color, it heals your body.

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:52.196 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I noticed that you have
intentional color that you use

00:48:52.196 --> 00:48:53.731 align:middle line:90%
in your wardrobe as well.

00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you -- you have fun
with it, don't you?

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.701 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:48:56.701 --> 00:48:58.936 align:middle line:90%
I always connect to myself.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.805 align:middle line:84%
This is why I need to
have a lot of clothes

00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:03.474 align:middle line:84%
because I never know
what color I'm going

00:49:03.474 --> 00:49:05.243 align:middle line:90%
to connect with in the morning.

00:49:05.243 --> 00:49:08.713 align:middle line:84%
So I usually have, okay,
these of the three choices,

00:49:08.713 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and then in the morning, I check
in and I go, how do I feel?

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.821 align:middle line:84%
This one. And I always choose
it also based on what I'm doing

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:20.525 align:middle line:84%
and who's next to me, because
I want them to feel connected

00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:22.493 align:middle line:84%
to that color and
for them to heal --

00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:23.127 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: -- through that color.

00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.662 align:middle line:90%
Nice, wonderful.

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:26.798 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if you have an
all-black wardrobe, though?

00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:27.999 align:middle line:90%
Does that --

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:29.233 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: You need to buy --
you need to go shopping.

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:31.135 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You need to have
some accents, accent colors.

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:32.637 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: And also, you
need to break it up,

00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because whilst black
can be very powerful,

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.442 align:middle line:90%
it can also drain the body.

00:49:37.442 --> 00:49:40.445 align:middle line:84%
So we always -- if we
wear black, we really want

00:49:40.445 --> 00:49:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we
have other colors,

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.484 align:middle line:84%
like I'm seeing magenta is
a great color for wisdom

00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:50.188 align:middle line:84%
and for allowing yourself
to feel passionate in life.

00:49:50.188 --> 00:49:53.124 align:middle line:84%
Orange, I've talked about
already, is a cleansing color.

00:49:53.124 --> 00:49:57.161 align:middle line:84%
One of the best colors to
take to cleanse emotions,

00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.263 align:middle line:84%
especially the ones
that have been stuck.

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:02.633 align:middle line:84%
So I combine orange and red
together when I want people

00:50:02.633 --> 00:50:07.238 align:middle line:84%
to go really deep inside and
release traumatic memories.

00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:08.172 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:09.373 align:middle line:84%
And is that one of
your favorites?

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.876 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a favorite?

00:50:11.876 --> 00:50:15.313 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: I love so many colors.

00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:16.614 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I [inaudible].

00:50:16.614 --> 00:50:17.715 align:middle line:90%
I love magenta.

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I would say it would
be one of my favorites.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:19.584 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Really?

00:50:19.584 --> 00:50:20.418 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:50:20.418 --> 00:50:20.952 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Is one of your favorites.

00:50:20.952 --> 00:50:21.786 align:middle line:90%
And orange?

00:50:21.786 --> 00:50:22.420 align:middle line:90%
You said that earlier, right?

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:22.987 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: And orange.

00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:23.688 align:middle line:90%
I like orange.

00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:24.322 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: You like orange.

00:50:24.322 --> 00:50:24.956 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: [Inaudible]

00:50:24.956 --> 00:50:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: All right.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.624 align:middle line:90%
So -- okay.

00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:28.626 align:middle line:84%
So sapphire, that's in
the blue family, right?

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.796 align:middle line:90%
Blue is a very calming color.

00:50:31.796 --> 00:50:33.464 align:middle line:90%
It's a cooling color.

00:50:33.464 --> 00:50:37.935 align:middle line:84%
So it's a color that's great
for clearing things in the skin.

00:50:37.935 --> 00:50:41.839 align:middle line:84%
So when we need -- you know,
when we have inflammation,

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:44.709 align:middle line:84%
blue is one of the best
colors or sapphire.

00:50:44.709 --> 00:50:47.745 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we need to
relax and we're really anxious,

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:51.215 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people have
anxiety, so blue's a color

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:54.752 align:middle line:84%
that just lets you
calm down, relax,

00:50:54.752 --> 00:50:57.688 align:middle line:84%
great for the nervous system
in terms of relaxation.

00:50:57.688 --> 00:50:59.457 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: There's so many
different kinds of blue though.

00:50:59.457 --> 00:51:01.292 align:middle line:84%
There's the Royals and
then there's the darks

00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:02.627 align:middle line:90%
and the lights.

00:51:02.627 --> 00:51:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Is there a particular blue
that's great for anxiety?

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.831 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:07.965 align:middle line:90%
So the one that I'm wearing.

00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:08.933 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Uh-huh.

00:51:08.933 --> 00:51:10.635 align:middle line:84%
It's a light -- lightish
blue, yeah.

00:51:10.635 --> 00:51:11.736 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:13.804 align:middle line:84%
Really, the lighter
colors help you to relax

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:17.542 align:middle line:90%
and to just soften your body.

00:51:17.542 --> 00:51:20.144 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then this is one
of my personal favorites is --

00:51:20.144 --> 00:51:21.913 align:middle line:90%
I call this "Bahamas blue."

00:51:21.913 --> 00:51:23.281 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckle]

00:51:23.281 --> 00:51:24.549 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:84%
This one is great for your
throat, for communication.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.454 align:middle line:84%
So when we need to be more
confident, when we need we need

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:33.057 align:middle line:84%
to communicate better, or
when you have a sore throat

00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:35.993 align:middle line:84%
and you just need just a
little bit of extra energy,

00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:37.161 align:middle line:90%
this is a great color.

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:38.429 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: This is the color have

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:42.633 align:middle line:84%
on my cell phone
screensaver is that color.

00:51:42.633 --> 00:51:46.103 align:middle line:84%
I took it out of a picture of
the window when I was flying

00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:49.207 align:middle line:84%
over that color of
blue, and I kept it.

00:51:49.207 --> 00:51:50.641 align:middle line:90%
It just really resonates.

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:51.776 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting.

00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:54.745 align:middle line:84%
As I explain that, you
can feel the same thing,

00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:55.780 align:middle line:90%
colors that you're resonating

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.715 align:middle line:84%
with as you're looking
at these slides.

00:51:57.715 --> 00:52:00.084 align:middle line:90%
Pink and silver.

00:52:00.084 --> 00:52:01.485 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Pink is one
of the best colors

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:04.388 align:middle line:84%
for opening your
heart, and softness.

00:52:04.388 --> 00:52:08.226 align:middle line:84%
It's fantastic when -- for
when you're feeling more love

00:52:08.226 --> 00:52:11.028 align:middle line:84%
or you want to expand the
love that you're feeling,

00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:14.332 align:middle line:84%
or you want to attract
someone into your life

00:52:14.332 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:90%
that is a loving partner.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.236 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So wearing pink or --

00:52:18.236 --> 00:52:21.305 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Wearing, sending it
to yourself, wearing jewelry

00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:25.409 align:middle line:84%
for women that is pink, nail
polish, anything that gives you

00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:28.579 align:middle line:84%
that energy, or decorating
your house

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:31.515 align:middle line:84%
where you have some
of that pink colors.

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:34.485 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Maybe in a bedroom, to
have those sorts of colors --

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:35.753 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:36.988 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- just in a small
area or a section that you

00:52:36.988 --> 00:52:38.122 align:middle line:84%
like because it might
overwhelm --

00:52:38.122 --> 00:52:39.023 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:39.023 --> 00:52:42.593 align:middle line:90%
A little bit, you learn.

00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:45.763 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: [Inaudible] But in terms
of, well, silver, of course,

00:52:45.763 --> 00:52:47.798 align:middle line:90%
we want to talk about that, too.

00:52:47.798 --> 00:52:48.833 align:middle line:90%
This is such a pretty picture.

00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:49.667 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.103 align:middle line:90%
Silver is about strengthening.

00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:54.038 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we need that
strength and we need

00:52:54.038 --> 00:52:58.142 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen ourselves, we
need to have more clarity,

00:52:58.142 --> 00:53:02.546 align:middle line:84%
we need to feel, okay, you know,
I'm feeling a little bit weak.

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.515 align:middle line:84%
Or I need to connect
my mind, body, spirit,

00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that's another great
color, you know.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.552 align:middle line:84%
Or I need to connect
with someone.

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.855 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And now, you can
use these cards as kind

00:53:10.855 --> 00:53:13.457 align:middle line:84%
of reading cards, like
a tarot type of thing.

00:53:13.457 --> 00:53:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:17.662 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So I can say,
okay, I have a question.

00:53:17.662 --> 00:53:20.064 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I focus
on that question,

00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:25.336 align:middle line:84%
and then I shuffle the cards,
and I put some energy into them,

00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:27.972 align:middle line:84%
you know, just take a moment
so I get the best information,

00:53:27.972 --> 00:53:32.043 align:middle line:84%
and then I pull a card,
and let's say, you know,

00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:34.412 align:middle line:84%
the first one is
jade, take action.

00:53:34.412 --> 00:53:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And this might be the card that
I'm going to work with today.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.818 align:middle line:84%
I need to focus on
taking action.

00:53:40.818 --> 00:53:42.553 align:middle line:90%
This is my intuitive guidance.

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.055 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Pick a card for the day.

00:53:44.055 --> 00:53:45.556 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Or, you know,
I might say,

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.091 align:middle line:84%
this is the color
I need to wear.

00:53:47.091 --> 00:53:49.393 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I need to
eat this color

00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:50.661 align:middle line:90%
or I need to drink this color.

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:51.996 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:55.066 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: Because I want people
to bring it into their life.

00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:56.534 align:middle line:90%
Or I might say, you know what?

00:53:56.534 --> 00:53:58.536 align:middle line:84%
I need to -- I want
to do a reading

00:53:58.536 --> 00:54:00.671 align:middle line:90%
from past, present, and future.

00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:03.074 align:middle line:84%
So I picked this color,
and this is about the past,

00:54:03.074 --> 00:54:04.842 align:middle line:90%
the actions that I took.

00:54:04.842 --> 00:54:06.844 align:middle line:90%
And then I take another card,

00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:09.613 align:middle line:84%
and this one says,
purify your body.

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:13.784 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I wasn't eating
well or I wasn't exercising,

00:54:13.784 --> 00:54:17.521 align:middle line:84%
and now I need that
purification of my body.

00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:20.091 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
that's going to happen

00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:23.828 align:middle line:84%
for me is improving my
vision, and I can look at that

00:54:23.828 --> 00:54:26.430 align:middle line:84%
as improving my vision,
my eyesight,

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:29.934 align:middle line:84%
or improving my vision
of my life.

00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:31.969 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to see my life?

00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:34.505 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do in my life now?

00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:36.507 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then you'll start
to see things around your life

00:54:36.507 --> 00:54:38.743 align:middle line:84%
that resonate towards
those particular colors.

00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:40.077 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:41.712 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then you use those
colors for healing energy.

00:54:41.712 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I can place, you know, these
colors on my body, especially --

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:48.753 align:middle line:84%
let's say I'm doing a
chakra healing, you know,

00:54:48.753 --> 00:54:50.654 align:middle line:90%
and I might say, okay, indigo,

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.757 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to place
in on my third eye.

00:54:52.757 --> 00:54:54.425 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's not
going to be my third eye

00:54:54.425 --> 00:54:56.961 align:middle line:84%
because I want people to
play and have no rules.

00:54:56.961 --> 00:55:01.132 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I literally place
that color on my body, you know,

00:55:01.132 --> 00:55:05.703 align:middle line:84%
and I breathe that color in,
and it's like -- it starts to --

00:55:05.703 --> 00:55:07.338 align:middle line:90%
because it's touching my skin,

00:55:07.338 --> 00:55:11.075 align:middle line:84%
and the skin is the largest
organ inside the body,

00:55:11.075 --> 00:55:13.577 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot chemical
reactions that happen

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:15.279 align:middle line:90%
within the skin when a color

00:55:15.279 --> 00:55:18.482 align:middle line:84%
or an energy touches the
skin, so I can put it.

00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:20.217 align:middle line:90%
I can put it in water.

00:55:20.217 --> 00:55:23.921 align:middle line:84%
If I want to charge water
[inaudible], I can place it

00:55:23.921 --> 00:55:28.793 align:middle line:84%
like this, or like that, and
send some energy with my hands

00:55:28.793 --> 00:55:30.461 align:middle line:90%
to it like I was showing you,

00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:32.396 align:middle line:84%
and the water's going
to taste different.

00:55:32.396 --> 00:55:34.398 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You can change the
structure of the water?

00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:35.065 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah.

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Fascinating.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.568 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you can do that
with words and vibrations.

00:55:37.568 --> 00:55:39.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
studies around that,

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.438 align:middle line:84%
so you can do it
with color as well.

00:55:40.438 --> 00:55:41.372 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Yeah, definitely.

00:55:41.372 --> 00:55:42.673 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Fascinating.

00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:44.442 align:middle line:84%
So what is the main message
that you would like people

00:55:44.442 --> 00:55:47.011 align:middle line:90%
to take away from your work?

00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:51.615 align:middle line:84%
>> IS: I want people to start
to understand that a life

00:55:51.615 --> 00:55:57.188 align:middle line:84%
of wellness means that you
choose how to live that life,

00:55:57.188 --> 00:56:00.758 align:middle line:84%
that you allow yourself
to expand, that there are

00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:06.697 align:middle line:84%
so many possibilities in life,
that you can heal your body.

00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:08.165 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop there.

00:56:08.165 --> 00:56:09.133 align:middle line:90%
You can heal your life.

00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:11.001 align:middle line:90%
You can transform your life.

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:12.136 align:middle line:90%
You can expand your life.

00:56:12.136 --> 00:56:13.537 align:middle line:90%
You can have miracles.

00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:15.639 align:middle line:84%
You can have incredible
connections

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:18.142 align:middle line:90%
with people that nourish you.

00:56:18.142 --> 00:56:21.879 align:middle line:84%
You can have a connection
with your soul, with divinity.

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:24.682 align:middle line:84%
You can have fantastic
relationships.

00:56:24.682 --> 00:56:25.616 align:middle line:90%
And it can be easy.

00:56:25.616 --> 00:56:27.785 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be a struggle.

00:56:27.785 --> 00:56:29.687 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be hard.

00:56:29.687 --> 00:56:31.188 align:middle line:90%
Life is magical.

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:31.989 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:32.823 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:56:32.823 --> 00:56:34.158 align:middle line:90%
It's miraculous.

00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:37.928 align:middle line:84%
Every day gives you an
opportunity to start again.

00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:42.032 align:middle line:84%
And if you're willing to open
your mind, open your heart,

00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:46.170 align:middle line:84%
connect to your soul, and try
things, anything is possible.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.138 align:middle line:90%
The impossible is possible.

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:51.308 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And then you could also
take that energy and heal others

00:56:51.308 --> 00:56:53.544 align:middle line:84%
as you do, you know,
through those connections,

00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:55.379 align:middle line:90%
through color, through love,

00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:57.748 align:middle line:84%
through those different
types of energies as well.

00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:00.117 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand that
and get comfortable with that

00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:02.353 align:middle line:84%
in your own body, then you
can forward it to others.

00:57:02.353 --> 00:57:03.487 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:57:03.487 --> 00:57:04.255 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Magical.

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:05.122 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Magical.

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:07.558 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:07.558 --> 00:57:08.792 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:11.495 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've
traveled all over the world

00:57:11.495 --> 00:57:16.534 align:middle line:84%

and catching on like wildfire.

00:57:16.534 --> 00:57:19.069 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much

00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:20.137 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:21.005 align:middle line:90%
>> IS: Thank you for having me.

00:57:21.005 --> 00:57:22.139 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:57:22.139 --> 00:57:24.275 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I had a good time
to thank you very much.
