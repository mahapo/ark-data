00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.329 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.497 align:middle line:90%
Over half a million people

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.799 align:middle line:84%
in the US are burdened
with Crohn's disease.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.768 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today
was one of them.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.737 align:middle line:84%
However, Mee McCormick
decided to fight back

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.174 align:middle line:84%
when this debilitating disease
almost cost her her entire

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.444 align:middle line:84%
quality of life and
left her near dead.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, today in her new
book "My Kitchen Cure",

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:84%
she shares her amazing
discoveries

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:90%
on the healing power of food.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.889 align:middle line:84%
And out of her plight, Mee also
became a TV cooking personality

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:84%
and she's created a lifestyle
that will help anyone suffering

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:84%
from any form of
autoimmune disease.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.964 align:middle line:84%
Welcome. Thank you
for being here.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Tracy McCormick: Thank you.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness,
you have so much to share.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.302 align:middle line:84%
Such a huge message,
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.237 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I-- you know I'm

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.671 align:middle line:84%
so glad I'm here
too in many ways.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.439 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.509 align:middle line:84%
So, all right, tell me a
little bit about how it was

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.511 align:middle line:90%
when you were growing up.

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.645 align:middle line:90%
Where did you grow up?

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I grow up
in-- well, I was born--

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.617 align:middle line:84%
I'm Appalachian, so I was
born in Appalachian Mountains.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:26.686 align:middle line:84%
And then my mother
moved to Ohio and I grew

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.655 align:middle line:84%
up in a little town
called Oberlin.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.491 align:middle line:84%
And Oberlin was a
super liberal--

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.261 align:middle line:84%
is a super liberal arts
community and we move there

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:84%
because she was--
became a single mother.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.131 align:middle line:84%
And there was a strong
women's community.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:90%
And we lived in a very poor part

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.138 align:middle line:84%
of town predominantly
African-American part of town.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.374 align:middle line:84%
And it was just one of
those stories, you know,

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:51.577 align:middle line:84%
late '70s early '80s, food
stamps, single parent.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:54.748 align:middle line:84%
She worked two jobs because
she had an autoimmune disease.

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:55.815 align:middle line:90%
She had Crohn's disease.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, she had
the disease as well.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.687 align:middle line:84%
So, you're working
with her having this.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But did she have the
awareness at all about food?

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.324 align:middle line:90%
What types of foods, I mean--

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.458 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: She had
zero awareness of food.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:90%
She--

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because she
didn't have a lot of choice.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.528 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It
is the early '80s.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.298 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the
first people--

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
still in that wave of
first, sort of looking

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle line:90%
at autoimmune disease.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even certain if
they knew it was autoimmune,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.772 align:middle line:90%
I'm not certain about anything

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
because I was just a little
girl watching her suffer.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.542 align:middle line:90%
She was in and out

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.612 align:middle line:84%
of the Cleveland
Clinic and it was awful.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And she barely ate.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you have-- we
have a picture here of some

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.818 align:middle line:84%
of the food that you
did eat at that time.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.919 align:middle line:90%
We can take a look at this--

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.753 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:34.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It consisted of, what?

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.722 align:middle line:90%
We had Spam--

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:40.126 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Spam, chipped ham,
ketchup, white bread, macaroni

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.495 align:middle line:84%
and cheese, and I
had a dairy allergy.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.899 align:middle line:84%
Just minimal food, my
mother's family is Italian.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.035 align:middle line:84%
And so, we always had a
tomato sauce and pasta.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.304 align:middle line:84%
It was inexpensive and a pot
of sauce would go a week.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.173 align:middle line:84%
But we just didn't
have access to food

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.508 align:middle line:84%
because we lived
in a food desert.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:59.579 align:middle line:84%
So, the combination of
no car, no bus system,

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.884 align:middle line:84%
no public transportation and no
money and a sick mother who is

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:06.386 align:middle line:84%
in and out of work
meant no food.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.154 align:middle line:90%
Food was an issue.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.457 align:middle line:84%
I was hungry most
of my childhood.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture here of what
your food cabinet looked like.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:16.596 align:middle line:84%
I think we have here, is this--
where did you get all these--

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.698 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: That was-- what
happens is when you're a child

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.801 align:middle line:84%
and a person who doesn't
have money and access to food

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.638 align:middle line:84%
and then you grow up and
you earn your own money.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
You-- and you get
food, what do you do?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.175 align:middle line:84%
You buy all the foods
that you couldn't have.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.646 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, I became a
food hoarder like most people.

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.414 align:middle line:90%
If I had food in my kitchen,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:36.516 align:middle line:84%
then we had food,
then we were OK.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.151 align:middle line:84%
And so, my husband
would complain and say,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.387 align:middle line:84%
"You buy all these food
and we don't even eat it

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.754 align:middle line:90%
and we throw it away."

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.956 align:middle line:90%
But I had to have it.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.192 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was obsessed
with processed food.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:49.195 align:middle line:84%
Because believe it or
not, my mother wasn't

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.032 align:middle line:84%
such a processed food
person, we didn't have money.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So, processed food at
the time was expensive,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.402 align:middle line:90%
it's changed, now it's cheaper.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.104 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But we
didn't have money for it.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.573 align:middle line:84%
So, when I did have money
and earn my own money

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.443 align:middle line:84%
and had a family of my own,
I became a food hoarder.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.446 align:middle line:84%
I just had anything in a box,
I shop by the picture, so.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
[ Laugh ]

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.581 align:middle line:90%
With all the pictures.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh that looks
good, that's pretty.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: That's
the way I saw it.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you
then took this--

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.223 align:middle line:84%
all these foods that you're
eating and you got sicker

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
as an adult than
you were as a child?

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.227 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: When I was
born, I'm an interesting case.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
I was born and I had something
called an intussusception.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:28.401 align:middle line:84%
And that meant my intestines
were born sort-- were formed--

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.203 align:middle line:90%
they collapsed on themselves.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:33.873 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out later
when I got the test results

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.476 align:middle line:84%
from the labs as an
adult, I researched

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.747 align:middle line:84%
and contacted the hospital
that I had an ulceration

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.917 align:middle line:84%
which is said not to be
true that you can't be born

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.853 align:middle line:84%
with an ulceration in your
intestines, but I was.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:51.024 align:middle line:84%
So, I had an operation the day I
was born to-- like a resection.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.358 align:middle line:84%
They removed part
of my intestines

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and connected them again.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very sickly
child and I had a lot

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.865 align:middle line:84%
of food sensitivities
and food allergies.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:02.936 align:middle line:84%
But we were too poor to
shop for different kids.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.438 align:middle line:84%
And so, I had to eat
what I was allergic to

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.507 align:middle line:90%
and eat what I was sensitive to.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, OK.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.777 align:middle line:84%
So, you moved out of
that and you got married

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:11.845 align:middle line:90%
and where did you live?

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:12.946 align:middle line:84%
Where did you live
when you got married?

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I got
married and we lived

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.249 align:middle line:90%
in Nashville, on a ranch.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: We lived on a
cattle ranch which is amazing.

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:20.987 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: In a way we'll
getting to that story

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.456 align:middle line:84%
because in a way
it saved your life.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.491 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But in the
interim you moved

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.394 align:middle line:84%
to the jungle, why
did you do that?

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:28.528 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Well,

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:29.896 align:middle line:84%
what happened is we were
leaving in two places.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.365 align:middle line:84%
We were living in LA because
my husband had a project in LA

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.769 align:middle line:84%
and I was a writer, and we
also lived in Nashville.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.371 align:middle line:84%
And then he finished his
project in LA and we said,

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.906 align:middle line:84%
"We're not going to
keep living here."

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And it was before
my daughter started school

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.244 align:middle line:84%
and I really wanted
to write a book.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:47.347 align:middle line:84%
I had this dream all of
my life to write a book.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.149 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it wasn't even
just a dream as much

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.618 align:middle line:84%
as it was a conversation
with myself

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.219 align:middle line:84%
that I was going
to write a book.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.389 align:middle line:84%
So, I had a plan to write a
book called the "Adventures

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.391 align:middle line:90%
of Princess Know It All".

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.394 align:middle line:84%
And I-- we decided let's
have a grand adventure,

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.463 align:middle line:84%
we'll go to the jungle,
we'll pack our babies.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.199 align:middle line:84%
My baby was one and
my other one was five.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.503 align:middle line:84%
And we'll-- Lee love to
surf and I love Mexico.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.906 align:middle line:84%
So, we rented a house
in Mexico closed up--

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:14.741 align:middle line:84%
shut everything down
in LA and moved

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.709 align:middle line:84%
to a little town called
Sayulita in the mouth

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.978 align:middle line:84%
of the jungle, right
on the beach.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it was
beautiful there.

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It was amazing.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:22.816 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
I took an office

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:84%
and I got my work ethic back
and I started writing the

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
"Adventures of Princess
Know It All."

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.421 align:middle line:90%
And I started a blog.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:33.626 align:middle line:84%
And that blog actually spun
me into writing for magazines

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:90%
because the blog was picked up.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.931 align:middle line:84%
And I really was
on this adventure.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.098 align:middle line:90%
But then--

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, what
time-- what year was that?

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.869 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: This
was six years ago.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Six years ago.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.004 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Everything
has been happening fast.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Life
changed in a minute.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But then, OK, so we
have a picture here of you

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:90%
in the jungle and you writing--

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.144 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- and enjoying
yourself.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
But you were still at that
point very unaware that you were

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.349 align:middle line:90%
as sick as you were, right?

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well,
I would think that at

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.487 align:middle line:84%
about 25 years old, I
suffered my first bowel--

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:01.888 align:middle line:90%
partial bowel obstruction.

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.923 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
everything stops flowing

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.425 align:middle line:90%
through the digestive tract.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.728 align:middle line:84%
Blood, nothing moves, they shut
down, there's inflammation.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.497 align:middle line:90%
It begins to close.

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like having-- it's like a
heart attack in your intestines,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.934 align:middle line:90%
like, you can feel it.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:16.903 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You can
feel everything stops.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.372 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
so-- and you feel it

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.541 align:middle line:84%
from the abdomen
down to your feet.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:25.178 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first
bowel obstruction at 25.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And went to the hospital and
they thought I had scar tissue

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.249 align:middle line:90%
from the surgery at birth.

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:30.884 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
thought it was.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:34.287 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I
started to get a burn

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.722 align:middle line:90%
in my stomach, in my abdomen.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:38.257 align:middle line:90%
And that burn was radiated.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, really what it
was was just this common

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.896 align:middle line:90%
digestive distress.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.598 align:middle line:84%
You know, had a-- I started
to form a relationship

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:48.001 align:middle line:84%
with not feeling
well after I ate.

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Which you're talking
for most people right now.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Most people right
now have gas bloating pressure.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Burning.

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.343 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Discomfort,
burning all of the above.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.312 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was one
of those people.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.613 align:middle line:90%
And it just continued.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.916 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
another partial obstruction,

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:04.083 align:middle line:90%
go back to the hospital.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.919 align:middle line:84%
They pumped my stomach
through my nose.

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:90%
It was awful, it was traumatic--

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:09.789 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And they
would say, "Well that's all,

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.791 align:middle line:90%
you just had inflammation."

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.895 align:middle line:84%
But no one ever really thought
that it could be anything else.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:21.034 align:middle line:84%
So, then when we were living in
the jungle, the radiating pain--

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.403 align:middle line:84%
I mean I talk about
it and I remember it

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:24.771 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a nightmare.

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.974 align:middle line:84%
And it became horrible to the
point where I couldn't eat.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:30.777 align:middle line:84%
And the bowel obstructions
were happening more and more.

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:32.378 align:middle line:90%
So, we came back to LA..

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: For test.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, you did.

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:35.647 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I did.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I left the jungle because I
had a terrible obstruction

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.955 align:middle line:84%
and my husband was in the
United States, I was alone.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:46.459 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a heavily
narco area of the jungle.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:49.729 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the narcos were
fighting for control.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, that part
of Mexico is not safe.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.434 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, it wasn't
safe and I had an obstruction

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.102 align:middle line:90%
at night on a Saturday.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.571 align:middle line:84%
I had a housekeeper that
would come on Mondays.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:90%
But it was Saturday and no one

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.875 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle really knew
me to come and save me.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.643 align:middle line:90%
So, I was--

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:04.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, no one-- oh,

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.679 align:middle line:84%
so you stayed there
first for several days.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.815 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: In pain with two
babies and I couldn't move.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.317 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, I knew
I had to get out of there

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.285 align:middle line:90%
or I was going to die there.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.789 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you came and
we have a picture here

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:20.793 align:middle line:84%
of what you looked like at that
point and you were pretty thin.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:22.261 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: 89 pounds.

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 89 pounds.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.697 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: 89 pounds.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is a picture
of your face at that point.

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.333 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: When was this taken?

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.871 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I think
that picture was taken

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:35.541 align:middle line:84%
about believe it or not
maybe four years ago.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, wow, wow.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle line:90%
And look at you now.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.812 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, we're going to
get to that part but what was--

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.216 align:middle line:84%
and something that you
pointed out for me here

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.251 align:middle line:84%
in this picture was
the fear in your face.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.586 align:middle line:90%
And people go through this.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.155 align:middle line:84%
When you have digestive issues,
you don't know what to do,

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.224 align:middle line:84%
there's no band aid
you can put on it.

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:52.558 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well,
there is no band aid

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.927 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see
it from the outside.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.196 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And it's
with any invisible disease,

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.332 align:middle line:90%
any type of chronic disease.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: True.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.734 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And the
fear that I had was

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.137 align:middle line:90%
because my mother died at 39.

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.106 align:middle line:84%
And I was devastated
by her loss.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah.

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.542 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: My mom
was an amazing person.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.545 align:middle line:84%
And when she died,
it left a hole

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.347 align:middle line:90%
in my heart as a young girl.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:17.583 align:middle line:84%
And when I got as sick as
her, I thought, "Oh no,

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.419 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave my girls."

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:23.756 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And that fear,
you know, getting well,

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle line:84%
the next phase of my
life from getting well.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:31.264 align:middle line:84%
Before I could even begin to
get well, I had to sort of move

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that blanket of black
butterfly that surround me.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.369 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was swarmed
with the fear of death.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Constantly.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.738 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Constantly,
constantly.

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:42.341 align:middle line:84%
I mean it just I would fall
into tears in a conversation

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
because I just knew
I was leaving.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.079 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to leave them.

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:49.614 align:middle line:84%
And it because I had
experienced that type of loss,

00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:52.118 align:middle line:90%
it shook me to my core.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, how did
you get out of that?

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.154 align:middle line:90%
How did you--

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:58.958 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I-- well, when
I embarked on my food journey,

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle line:84%
I also started working with
a cabalistic acupuncturist

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:90%
who happen to pray a lot.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:08.167 align:middle line:84%
And he would put needles in
me and he would talk to me.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.403 align:middle line:90%
And he would talk to me each--

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle line:84%
he was a very interesting
acupuncturist

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:20.046 align:middle line:84%
because each needle represented
for me like a past experience.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:24.016 align:middle line:84%
Not a past life as in before
this life but a past life

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.252 align:middle line:84%
within this life, so
something that it happened.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:26.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In this life.

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:27.854 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:28.721 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And his
needles would go in,

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.323 align:middle line:90%
and I would have a memory.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.359 align:middle line:84%
I would have a memory
of my father leaving.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.229 align:middle line:84%
A memory of not being
good enough as a teenager.

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:38.864 align:middle line:84%
A memory of an abusive
relationship.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:84%
A memory of when I was an
abusive person in my life

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.537 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
abusive at some point.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.371 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And this is normal step

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.707 align:middle line:84%
that people go through
a lifetime--

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.041 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Regular steps,
nothing like-- traumatic.

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:51.844 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Just, you know,
when I wasn't as positive--

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Kind person.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:53.246 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- as a person.

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:55.148 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- or
kind as I could be.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.649 align:middle line:90%
And so, each needle was attached

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:59.485 align:middle line:84%
to a judgment of
my self or fear.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.121 align:middle line:84%
And overtime, I would
lay on his table

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.158 align:middle line:84%
and I would just fall
sleep into these memories.

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is that
where you started to--

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:11.264 align:middle line:84%
what you really think
contributed to the fire

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:14.767 align:middle line:84%
in the belly, the gut,
the inflammation one

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.403 align:middle line:84%
of these negative
memories and thoughts

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.005 align:middle line:84%
that you hold on
to unconsciously?

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:20.873 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, I think
that they become the burdens--

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:22.308 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- that we carry.

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:23.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And our--

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.612 align:middle line:84%
you know, our root of our
body is our intestines.

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.281 align:middle line:90%
And if the root of the--

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:30.983 align:middle line:84%
of a tree, the trees
roots are their core.

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.819 align:middle line:84%
And if a tree's roots
are poisoned

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.854 align:middle line:84%
or toxic then the
tree goes down.

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:36.222 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:39.525 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, we really
pack around all of our sadness.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.929 align:middle line:84%
And I packed it and held it
tightly in my intestines.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And-- so that was--

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.699 align:middle line:84%
I've actually really talked
about it this way before.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:47.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It makes so
much sense though.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I've
never talk about him,

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:51.003 align:middle line:84%
his name is Gil Ben-Ami,
he's in Nashville.

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:53.539 align:middle line:84%
And it means happy son
of my people in Hebrew.

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:90%
That was his name?

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:55.775 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
his name is Gil.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.076 align:middle line:90%
He's still there.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But it-- the act
of what you went through was

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.248 align:middle line:84%
so important because they
led you to solutions.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.216 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I mean that
was [inaudible].

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.419 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I mean that was
my first action of like what was

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:10.723 align:middle line:84%
that really did is I got
to see that being a child

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:15.094 align:middle line:84%
of a sick parent or
an unwell person,

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
it physically affects you.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.601 align:middle line:84%
Children are deeply
affected by all of the adults

00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:23.502 align:middle line:84%
that are suffering
chronic disease.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.605 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of things
I knew that hurt me.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:28.774 align:middle line:84%
The loss of my father, the
loss of this, the heartache

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:32.011 align:middle line:84%
over relationships,
but I had never looked

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:37.049 align:middle line:84%
at my mother's suffering and
how it influenced my fears

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.084 align:middle line:90%
in my future.

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Until that moment on
that man's stable.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so, when you
started to move all of that,

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:46.459 align:middle line:84%
and started to release all
that which I'm sure took--

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.426 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:48.861 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's pretty
fast with him.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.463 align:middle line:84%
Because I would go
three times a week

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:52.965 align:middle line:84%
because the other side
effect of acupuncture

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:56.302 align:middle line:84%
and healing the digestive
tract is it helps with pain.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:58.604 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, I
would have less pain.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
get on his table.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:02.208 align:middle line:84%
When I would go with
the memories

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.776 align:middle line:90%
and they had the therapist--

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:04.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well, yeah.

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:05.478 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Because
I had to talk about it.

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:06.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I was like,
I have to find somebody

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.784 align:middle line:84%
to help me process who I've been
so that I can clean it all up.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:14.654 align:middle line:84%
You know, I want to be my
next greatest version on me--

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:15.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:16.722 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- and how
I'm going to clean that up?

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:17.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's what leaders do.

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.991 align:middle line:90%
Now you moved yourself

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
into finding whole
foods, and finding--

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- foods that actually
started to heal your body.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.898 align:middle line:90%
How did you get to these foods?

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, like sort of
all happened at the same time.

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.403 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I meet Gil, I
left the jungle because we--

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
the doctors had found a
hole in my small intestine.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.474 align:middle line:84%
And it was the total
circumference and it meant

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:38.077 align:middle line:84%
that I have been hemorrhaging
for many years slowly.

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:42.014 align:middle line:84%
I was completely anemic, I
was on Iron transfusions.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:84%
We were-- they were
searching me for cancer.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.252 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't find any.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:49.855 align:middle line:84%
And the last chance was to
do a biopsy of the whole.

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:54.193 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't well enough
to undergo that procedure.

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.595 align:middle line:90%
And so, at the same time,

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:84%
I was back in Nashville,
I was with doctors.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:02.301 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing the Acupuncturist
because I believe in supporting.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:04.136 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know,
you got to do it both.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.237 align:middle line:90%
You got to do it all.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.706 align:middle line:84%
You can't make one right
and the other wrong.

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:90%
You got to work as a team.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's great point.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.308 align:middle line:90%
Great point.

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:10.509 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.378 align:middle line:84%
And then, I connected to
woman name Virginia Harper

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.779 align:middle line:90%
who is in Nashville.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.815 align:middle line:90%
Half the year lives in Spain.

00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:18.784 align:middle line:84%
I have found a book
in Mexico online.

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.586 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get
mail on the jungle.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.723 align:middle line:84%
And the book that I found online
was about this woman who lived

00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:26.492 align:middle line:84%
in Maine, who would
heal their body.

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, a good friend
of mine in Nashville,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.297 align:middle line:84%
Maryalice Kirchdoerffer who
is a body alignment person

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:34.633 align:middle line:84%
and therapist said, "You
should go see Virginia Harper,

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
she has a clinic and she helps
people get well with food."

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.574 align:middle line:84%
And so, I came into her
clinic, and there was this book

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.476 align:middle line:84%
that I'd found in
the jungle online.

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't live in
Maine, she lived in Spain.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.847 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But you found the book

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.649 align:middle line:84%
and you found your
way towards foods.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I did.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.518 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And this is-- this is
a picture here that you have

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.789 align:middle line:84%
of all the different diets
that you had tried, right?

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You went
through all these.

00:15:58.491 --> 00:15:59.425 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh yeah.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.626 align:middle line:84%
I started out with
Virginia Harper

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.395 align:middle line:84%
who is predominantly a
macrobiotic counselor.

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:03.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:04.764 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It
taught me the basics.

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.666 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful place to
start because it's old school--

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: --
simple, simple cooking.

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:10.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And it's and
you have-- you get skilled.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.339 align:middle line:84%
I mean you really
learn how to cook--

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:14.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That where you
got all your skills, OK.

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.342 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I got
main skills there,

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
but then that wasn't
enough for me.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what
the Maker's Diet was,

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.679 align:middle line:90%
what the Gerson diet was.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.649 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
all of the-- I wanted to--

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for my thread.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I needed to find the
string that connected it all

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.424 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't just
one way to wellness.

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:34.693 align:middle line:84%
And one way isn't going
to keep you well either.

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:36.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What is
the thread then?

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.129 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: The
thread is real food.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Real food.

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:38.931 align:middle line:90%
OK, and that's what you--

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:39.899 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Unadulterated
real food.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:40.599 align:middle line:90%
No chemicals--

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Whole food.

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.635 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Whole food.

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.738 align:middle line:84%
Food in its whole forms,
simply prepared, no chemicals,

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.841 align:middle line:84%
no additives, no
preservatives in rotation.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.242 align:middle line:90%
You must rotate your food.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:53.279 align:middle line:84%
If you do not rotate your
food, you'll create an excess.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:56.114 align:middle line:84%
And in that excess is
where the imbalance lies.

00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:59.051 align:middle line:84%
And the-- and the illness
will just creep back in

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.719 align:middle line:90%
or a new one will find its way.

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you've obviously
you've educated yourself a lot.

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:05.691 align:middle line:84%
About food and about
the body as well--

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.093 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- and then we have a
side here that you put together

00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:09.028 align:middle line:90%
about knowing your intestines--

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.095 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:10.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you learn
everything about--

00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a great idea.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.265 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh I think
it's a great idea too.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We have them,
we all have intestines.

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:17.103 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah and
it's not taught in school.

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:18.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.772 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And you go
to gastroenterologist,

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.739 align:middle line:84%
and they don't teach
you about them.

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.509 align:middle line:84%
And so, suddenly this life
[inaudible] and I felt, wow,

00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:26.479 align:middle line:90%
I have a wound in my intestine.

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.782 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that's
touching it is food.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:32.151 align:middle line:84%
Why can't the food
become medicine?

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.654 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't I-- if you have a
whole or scrape on your knee,

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.189 align:middle line:90%
what do you would put on it?

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.491 align:middle line:90%
You put medicine on it.

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't add unhealthy
bacteria, do you?

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right, right.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.863 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, if
you have a weakening

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:48.367 align:middle line:84%
in your digestive tract, and
you don't heal it properly,

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:49.768 align:middle line:90%
then what's going to happen?

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.538 align:middle line:84%
Your entire-- again that's your
root, that's your tree's root,

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.474 align:middle line:84%
that's your body's root if
the body is going to go down.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you learned about
your intestine, I think that's--

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I was--
and I wrote about it,

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.212 align:middle line:90%
it's like know thy intestines.

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:04.316 align:middle line:84%
If you have any sort of
health issues or imbalances,

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.553 align:middle line:84%
understand that the only
way to bring balance is

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.789 align:middle line:84%
in the small intestine because
that's where the villi are

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.859 align:middle line:84%
that grab the nutrition,
that then funnel it

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.729 align:middle line:84%
into the main vein, into the
liver, and into the blood.

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:18.864 align:middle line:84%
And if those intestines
are not working,

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.132 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to get well.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.534 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many
pills you take.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what about those
bad habits, those comfort foods,

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.405 align:middle line:90%
those things that you need to--

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:27.806 align:middle line:90%
I mean did that help you

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.875 align:middle line:84%
to educate yourself
about the foods and--

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- intestines in
order to kick those bad habits?

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:33.679 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know, I
think that's the whole thing.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.048 align:middle line:84%
I think that the more
that you go out there

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.183 align:middle line:90%
and you seek information.

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.884 align:middle line:84%
You know, my kitchen
cure is called

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.353 align:middle line:84%
that because it was
my kitchen cure.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.155 align:middle line:90%
And it was how I got well.

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:45.524 align:middle line:84%
But it's to inspire people
to find their own cure--

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That they
can do it, yeah.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: --
like ask questions.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.528 align:middle line:84%
Try things, see what
works in your body,

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:90%
what doesn't work in your body.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.332 align:middle line:84%
And the more information
you have then you have a

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:54.867 align:middle line:90%
consciousness going on.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.569 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to make choices,

00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:58.771 align:middle line:90%
and then it's your choice.

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:02.575 align:middle line:84%
That is a big deal
because we want on-- we--

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:05.978 align:middle line:84%
our food stuff is
mega, mega, mega, mega,

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.713 align:middle line:90%
mega, situation for us.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:09.915 align:middle line:84%
We have a situation
with our food

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:84%
because we're super
sensitive to it.

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're full of
our own self judgments,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:84%
we judge ourselves
what we feed ourselves,

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
what we feed our children,
what's in our refrigerator--

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: We do have a lot of--

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.226 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- what we eat.

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:21.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We have a lot of
conversation around food

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:21.627 align:middle line:90%
in our own heads, don't we?

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:22.928 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I own drug and
alcohol treatment centers

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.998 align:middle line:90%
and eating disorder clinics.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.333 align:middle line:90%
And the thing

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.002 align:middle line:84%
about understanding how people
change, is how I changed.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.704 align:middle line:84%
I watched-- I have
watched people

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:34.006 align:middle line:90%
for 12 years change their lives.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.843 align:middle line:84%
And shift their addictions and
change the story in their mind

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:41.247 align:middle line:84%
about why they're not well
or why they do what they do.

00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:42.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.716 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And I had to
apply that to my own life.

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:46.118 align:middle line:84%
So, the food conversation
is a sensitive one.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:50.456 align:middle line:84%
And if we make foods bad,
then we're never going to--

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
influence anyone.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, you talk

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.627 align:middle line:84%
about kicking those
habits in this other slide.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:57.329 align:middle line:84%
You talk about getting the
emotional support around it.

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:59.198 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that you-- those--

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.266 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:00.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- the food
clinics and-- the--

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:01.734 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:02.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- support centers.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:04.637 align:middle line:84%
Are they the same
things as the kitchens?

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:05.638 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: No,
they're different.

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:07.172 align:middle line:84%
They're-- we own
the Recovery Ranch.

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:09.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, my husband started
the Recovery Ranch on--

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:10.209 align:middle line:90%
in Nashville.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then we have
the Integrated Life Center

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.547 align:middle line:84%
in Nashville and their
holistic approaches to drug

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.183 align:middle line:84%
and alcohol addiction
and eating disorders.

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Healing addiction
through food as well.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.354 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
healing addiction

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.689 align:middle line:90%
through food is gigantic.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And of course
emotional addiction--

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:27.426 align:middle line:84%
I mean healing through
emotions as well--

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.061 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, it
all is connected, right?

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:29.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, absolutely.

00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:31.063 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It's all one.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: All right, so
you're steps to wellness.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:35.034 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of have five steps
here that you've laid out for us

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:90%
in terms of steps to wellness.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.071 align:middle line:90%
Yes. OK.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.307 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: First thing you
want to do is you want to start

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:45.044 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to what
are your food sensitivities.

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:45.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.079 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
the big things--

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:84%
the first thing to do
is to pay attention

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.517 align:middle line:84%
to what are you eating
all of the time.

00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:53.786 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to become
mindful of your food, you know.

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:55.954 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay attention what
am I eating, what am I craving--

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, you're saying--

00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:57.823 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- how many
times should I eat it.

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:58.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Food diary?

00:20:58.757 --> 00:20:59.291 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Food
diary is great.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.327 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And even
the simple like, oh,

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:03.996 align:middle line:84%
I ate those corn
chips yesterday.

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:07.333 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have those corn
chips three days in a row.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.869 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know, what am I doing?

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:13.505 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Just the
mindful, what am I feeding me,

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.874 align:middle line:84%
and what is my child
eating everyday.

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, That's
another huge part of it.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.845 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: A food journal
for your kids is a great idea.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: For them to do.

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:21.847 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Now for
them to do, for you to do.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it with them.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And make it fun.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:25.384 align:middle line:90%
So, it doesn't set up--

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.218 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah--

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:27.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- the whole addiction.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- you
can make a calendar

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.389 align:middle line:90%
that says, Monday, we ate this.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.892 align:middle line:84%
And then the-- once you start
doing it, by the second week,

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
they go "Oh mama, we haven't
had this since last week."

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.666 align:middle line:84%
That-- you don't think it sets
a-- you do it fun though, right?

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.167 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You
don't make it--

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:44.169 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Or
nothing can be made bad,

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.137 align:middle line:84%
and nothing can be
made restrictive.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.072 align:middle line:84%
It's not about what
you can't have.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:49.241 align:middle line:84%
It's about all the
things you can't have.

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You can have, right.

00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's very important.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.947 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Changing the
can't to can is gigantic.

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:56.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I notice
that when I switch

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:58.917 align:middle line:90%
to the gluten-free lifestyle.

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:00.018 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It would--
it started of for me,

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:03.188 align:middle line:84%
all that I couldn't eat and
all the things that I didn't--

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:06.325 align:middle line:84%
then I'll move to all of the
flowers that were as substitute

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.926 align:middle line:84%
for those things and
then I just let it go

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.361 align:middle line:90%
and just ate the whole foods.

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.562 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:12.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because you can
get as much carbohydrates

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:15.734 align:middle line:84%
from a sweet potato, then
you can with an almond,

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.536 align:middle line:90%
tapioca flower piece of bread.

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.937 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And then--

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:21.006 align:middle line:84%
and your not going to get the
beta-carotene and the vitamin C.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, in bread right.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:22.908 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: In the bread.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:23.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.144 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And so
that's what we do.

00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:27.112 align:middle line:84%
We try to replace the old
way that we were eating

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.347 align:middle line:90%
with different ingredients.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:31.383 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about a
completely new relationship

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:32.217 align:middle line:90%
with food.

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:33.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, OK.

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So, the sensitivity--
the five steps was

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.024 align:middle line:84%
to check your food
sensitivities, then also to--

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.592 align:middle line:90%
this is again on the slide.

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.795 align:middle line:90%
The first steps to wellness.

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:46.065 align:middle line:84%
And find out exactly what is
it that you're allergic too.

00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:47.332 align:middle line:90%
And how do you that?

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.567 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, you
have to stop completely.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.137 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, you've
identify your excesses.

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:54.473 align:middle line:84%
So, now you want to pay
attention and just figure

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:58.844 align:middle line:84%
out how do you feel when you
get off of those excesses.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So, dairy, sugar
of course, it's--

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.049 align:middle line:84%
that's just an excess that we
all have to be mindful off.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.084 align:middle line:84%
I have to be mindful of it
for the rest of my life.

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:06.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:07.886 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: But you want

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.788 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to
things like wheat.

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:12.057 align:middle line:84%
So, the big things you
stop the big things.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.926 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention to you
probably had too much wheat,

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:16.094 align:middle line:84%
too much dairy, or
too much [inaudible]--

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:17.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:18.163 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
too much sugar.

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:84%
So, you get rid-- you
have to be off of them

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:20.833 align:middle line:90%
of them for a period of time.

00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:22.801 align:middle line:84%
And then you introduce--
I mean not a week,

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:84%
and not two weeks,
like three months--

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:26.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:26.572 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: --
get off of them.

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:27.105 align:middle line:90%
And see--

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.241 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- how you feel.

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:29.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, because that's
how long it takes the body

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
to kind of repair.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.044 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, you got
to get it out of your body.

00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:33.412 align:middle line:90%
And the body has to come back.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you can eat it, and
then you can see what happens.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: See if the body
has an instant reaction.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, you're
really forming a mindfulness

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.587 align:middle line:84%
with your body what it feels
like, which is something,

00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:43.055 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
like a whole deal.

00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:45.257 align:middle line:90%
What do I fell like when I eat?

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:48.093 align:middle line:84%
Because we eat foods and we
get unconscious to the pain.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.595 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, we get
completely unconscious,

00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:51.763 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize
that that headache is

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:90%
because we just had that soy.

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or that
foggy thinking--

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.801 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:56.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- or the
irritability and all that stuff.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:57.603 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:58.837 align:middle line:90%
Like now, I can digest wheat.

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But if I eat wheat, I
can get super tired.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:03.742 align:middle line:90%
And then you pay for it later.

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I'm just so tired.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:06.378 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:07.412 align:middle line:90%
So, it's about food mindfulness.

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Mindfulness.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Which you did you
put together a great thing

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.017 align:middle line:90%
about what are you craving,

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.619 align:middle line:84%
what types of things
do you use your--

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and I love the slide
that you have here,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.456 align:middle line:84%
because you have the angel
and the devil kind of,

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:90%
you know, should I eat this?

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.026 align:middle line:90%
It's not good for me.

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:23.228 align:middle line:84%
We go back, we all
have that dialogue.

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
because it's the--

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:26.899 align:middle line:84%
its like am I failing
because, oh no,

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.634 align:middle line:90%
suddenly now I just ate that.

00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:29.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:31.036 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And yes,
I eat French fries.

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.672 align:middle line:84%
And when my kids they're not
in my house and we go out

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:35.574 align:middle line:84%
and they're at a birthday
party, they eat what's

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:36.441 align:middle line:90%
at the birthday party.

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:37.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:39.611 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Unless it's
just, you know, ridiculous.

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:40.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Some of
it is ridiculous.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's
really ridiculous.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:44.116 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
repair here.

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:46.518 align:middle line:84%
So, you're talking about
eating your probiotics.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:47.753 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yes.

00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:48.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I noticed
that you have a sample here

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:50.122 align:middle line:84%
of what a cultured
food is and a couple

00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:51.723 align:middle line:84%
of different probiotic
ideas here.

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:52.424 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:53.792 align:middle line:90%
This is really great.

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:57.195 align:middle line:84%
This is chickpeas, soy-free
miso, and this is a probiotic

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.997 align:middle line:90%
and it comes in a paste form.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:03.802 align:middle line:84%
And you dilute it in water and
then you add it in to any soup,

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:05.871 align:middle line:84%
any sauce, you don't
even have to cook it,

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:90%
you don't add it until the end.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.408 align:middle line:84%
And then you're eating
your probiotics.

00:25:09.408 --> 00:25:12.844 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have some
type of miso in our food,

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.746 align:middle line:90%
maybe three times a week.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:17.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, but miso is
soy bean paste, unless--

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.717 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But
this one is not soy.

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:19.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- you get that.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:20.519 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Unless
you get that.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:21.353 align:middle line:90%
And that's chickpeas soy-free.

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.156 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
then you have--

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.692 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You
have sauerkraut,

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:28.193 align:middle line:84%
and this is a red
cabbage sauerkraut

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:29.795 align:middle line:90%
with Himalayan sea salt.

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:31.663 align:middle line:84%
And Himalayan sea salt
aids in digestion.

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:32.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, that's all that is.

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:34.333 align:middle line:84%
It's just sauerkraut
and sea salt?

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:35.267 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It's fermented.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.969 align:middle line:84%
So, it means it's
made at the way

00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:39.638 align:middle line:84%
that sauerkraut was
made back in the day.

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:40.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was supposed
to be made.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.674 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: We
always ate with--

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
the thought of aiding
in digestion.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.813 align:middle line:84%
Ancestral cultures
had a relationship

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:49.214 align:middle line:84%
with their food and
their bodies.

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.617 align:middle line:84%
They knew if I ate
that, I feel this way.

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:54.319 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to eat this
to help me feel that way.

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.954 align:middle line:90%
So, this is a digestive enzyme.

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:57.522 align:middle line:90%
And as we get older we--

00:25:57.522 --> 00:26:00.192 align:middle line:84%
our body creates less
and less enzymes.

00:26:00.192 --> 00:26:03.161 align:middle line:84%
So, know thy intestines,
starts on the mouth,

00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.896 align:middle line:84%
you start to salivate,
you know, you're--

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.498 align:middle line:84%
you bring up all
your saliva comes up,

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:11.203 align:middle line:84%
you start to smell food, you
are beginning to create enzymes.

00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:14.106 align:middle line:84%
Then you chew the food in
your mouth, you're supposed

00:26:14.106 --> 00:26:15.641 align:middle line:90%
to chew like 100 times.

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's that
whole thing don't talk

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:19.044 align:middle line:90%
with food in your mouth?

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.912 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, A,
we don't want to see it.

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.382 align:middle line:84%
But B, you want to create
more enzymes so that

00:26:23.382 --> 00:26:24.983 align:middle line:84%
when the food gets
to the stomach,

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:26.518 align:middle line:90%
the stomach can break it down.

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:27.619 align:middle line:90%
And then when it gets

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.454 align:middle line:84%
to the small intestine
it can be absorbed.

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:30.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So,
there's a whole situation.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:84%
Is that like a process
to get into eating?

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is that why protein
shakes and so forth aren't great

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:39.064 align:middle line:84%
for enzyme production
because you don't chew them,

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:40.499 align:middle line:90%
you drink them?

00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:42.334 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I don't know,
that's a brilliant question.

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Could be, but unless
you put something in it

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:46.538 align:middle line:84%
that you can chew on like
nuts or something in it.

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:47.439 align:middle line:90%
So, it helps you--

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.273 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right, so this--

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:51.343 align:middle line:84%
I have a question about the
whole cultured food idea.

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.377 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:53.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is that I
view them personally

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:56.381 align:middle line:84%
as complicated, but
this looks easy.

00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: They're
not complicated,

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.754 align:middle line:84%
I mean the ingredients are
salt, water and cabbage.

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:04.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You don't
have a starter culture

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:05.457 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff?

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:07.159 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: No, you can make
this your own self, you know,

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:08.994 align:middle line:90%
you just do it, it's not hard.

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then what
do you eat that with?

00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.563 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And then I--

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:15.233 align:middle line:84%
like this morning I made as
cilantro omelet with tons

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:18.437 align:middle line:84%
of cilantro because cilantro
is a digestive aid by the way.

00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:21.106 align:middle line:84%
And what else did I put in
there, a little vegenaise

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:23.041 align:middle line:90%
to make my eggs go pop.

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.143 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Because
I don't use milk.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.946 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then I put
a scoop of that on top of it

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:31.483 align:middle line:84%
and I eat-- I love
eggs and sauerkraut.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.651 align:middle line:84%
And my little girl
eats it on the side,

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:33.652 align:middle line:90%
we eat it all the time.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:34.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, that's
sounds great.

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It's fantastic.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's-- I
mean Japanese--

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.957 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Cooking
egg reuben.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, that's great.

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:40.892 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's an egg
reuben, it's an egg reuben.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:42.127 align:middle line:90%
Fried egg reuben.

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: See I could see
why you have a cookbook now.

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:45.464 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:27:45.464 --> 00:27:46.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right.

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:49.334 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, in addition
to taking all of this

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.168 align:middle line:90%
and putting it all together.

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:51.369 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You have other
ideas around what it means

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:56.675 align:middle line:84%
to put together cultured
foods and fermented foods

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.511 align:middle line:84%
and natural probiotics
into your diet.

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.378 align:middle line:90%
What is this lovely thing?

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:01.213 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: OK.

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:02.514 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is Kudzu root.

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.684 align:middle line:84%
So, Kudzu is a plant because
you plant that grows wild

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:08.086 align:middle line:84%
and crazy everywhere
in the South.

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:10.756 align:middle line:84%
But what it is is you
use it as a starch.

00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:13.458 align:middle line:84%
So, whenever you're going
to make a roux or you want

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:16.027 align:middle line:84%
to make slurry and you
want to thicken your food,

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:84%
or you want to thicken your
soup you will use cornstarch.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.733 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And what
does cornstarch do for you?

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:25.871 align:middle line:84%
Nothing. But if you use Kudzu
root it heals the lining

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.874 align:middle line:84%
of the digestive track and
it calms the nervous system.

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:30.942 align:middle line:84%
You have more nerves in your
intestines than in anywhere--

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:33.378 align:middle line:84%
than in your mind,
your brain, your mind.

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, this can
thicken a soup, it can--

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.014 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It's a thickener.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's a thickener, you--

00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:38.416 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But it's
a calmer, it's calming

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:41.186 align:middle line:84%
to the digestive tract and
I used it like a bandage.

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.821 align:middle line:90%
So, it calms the nervous system.

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What else
do you put it in?

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:47.025 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I put it in
soups, I put it in sauces,

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I make an apple Kudzu drink

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.797 align:middle line:84%
which is just organic
apple juice heated up,

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.965 align:middle line:84%
you dilute that in
cold water first--

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:54.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:55.734 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: --
and then you add it

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:56.968 align:middle line:90%
in to your hot apple juice--

00:28:56.968 --> 00:28:58.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:28:58.103 --> 00:28:59.237 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- and it
taste like apple pie.

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:01.473 align:middle line:84%
It's great for headaches,
migraines, fevers,

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.875 align:middle line:90%
cold sores, herpes outbreaks.

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It calms your nervous system.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.979 align:middle line:84%
And it's fantastic for
the digestive tract.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
wholeheartedly

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.784 align:middle line:90%
that was key to my wellness.

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.619 align:middle line:84%
That was like a band
aid all the way through.

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:15.854 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you drink
that all the time?

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.055 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh
yeah, and I still do.

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:18.857 align:middle line:84%
Instead of hot chocolate
we have that in our house.

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:19.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What a great idea.

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.726 align:middle line:84%
So, you put this in a
room temperature water

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:22.861 align:middle line:90%
so that the heat doesn't--

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.095 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Cold
water to dilute--

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.298 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: --
to break it down.

00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:28.333 align:middle line:84%
And then you add it to something
hot to make it thicken.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Brilliant.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:30.402 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:31.703 align:middle line:84%
And now you also have a slide
here of sea vegetables--

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:32.904 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:33.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- now sea
vegetables are also amazing

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
for the digestive tract, right?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.241 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: They're great
for the digestive tract

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:37.909 align:middle line:84%
and their packed
with trace minerals.

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.778 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're some
of the last vegetables

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.446 align:middle line:90%
that still have trace minerals

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
because their soil has been
completely over worked.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.286 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're also full of
iodine which is anti fungal,

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.621 align:middle line:90%
great for the thyroid.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough iodine
in our diets because we go

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.158 align:middle line:84%
on these kicks where
we're like, oh,

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.593 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
have any salt now.

00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:55.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:56.995 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But we shouldn't
have any processed food salts

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.496 align:middle line:84%
but we should have
salts with iodine,

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.931 align:middle line:84%
they naturally have
iodine in it.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.632 align:middle line:90%
And iodine--

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.035 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And sea-- and
iodine neutralizes radiation.

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:07.072 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a culture that's
inundated with radiation.

00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:08.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I mean
every single day we're

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.475 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, we're
being radiated.

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:11.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, dulse is something
is something that I love.

00:30:11.877 --> 00:30:12.711 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:30:12.711 --> 00:30:13.511 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: You like dulse.

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Do you like dulse?

00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:15.313 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I like
dulse and I make sure

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.581 align:middle line:90%
that I change them all.

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:20.819 align:middle line:84%
I use-- so rotation, I use
hijiki and kombu the most.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I use wakame for hormones
and wakame in the miso soup.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.226 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you're trying--
like you're cycle is coming up

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:29.628 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to stay balanced,

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:30.762 align:middle line:90%
you want to use wakame.

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:32.197 align:middle line:84%
They each have-- because
they have a different

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:33.331 align:middle line:90%
mineral content.

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, where do
you find these things?

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:36.167 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to go to a
specific Asian market?

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.535 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You can
go to an Asian market,

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.604 align:middle line:84%
you can go to a health food
store, you can go to whole foods

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.306 align:middle line:90%
and you can order them online.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:42.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, its'
called wakame--

00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:45.777 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Wakame,
hijiki and kombu.

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.345 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
that I use the most.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.214 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And I like dulse.

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:49.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then
you cook with these?

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.149 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: In anything that
you're making fishes or--

00:30:52.117 --> 00:30:52.918 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oatmeal.

00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:54.519 align:middle line:90%
I soak my oatmeal overnight.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.588 align:middle line:84%
If you're having any kind
of digestive distress,

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.356 align:middle line:84%
you want to soak your
grains overnight.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.226 align:middle line:84%
You put a little piece and
it hydrates in the water.

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.461 align:middle line:84%
And then you can remove
it or you can cook it

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:04.829 align:middle line:90%
and it adds trace minerals.

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:08.233 align:middle line:84%
And it helps break down the
hard to digest carbohydrates.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.602 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And either
you cook it with your beans.

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.771 align:middle line:84%
It's also a flavor
enhancer like a bay leaf.

00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:16.174 align:middle line:84%
And you can take it out or
you can dice it and eat it.

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.175 align:middle line:90%
What else do I do?

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:19.077 align:middle line:84%
I made bean chili
and I add in the--

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:22.213 align:middle line:84%
I use hijiki and then
in the end I add miso.

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's fantastic.

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:23.982 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing--

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:24.816 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: My
kids don't even--

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:25.984 align:middle line:90%
they don't even think about it.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:27.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you ever
have any digestive issues

00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:29.387 align:middle line:90%
or food poisoning--

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.388 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Anything.

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- or stomach
flu or anything.

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:34.125 align:middle line:84%
These are the-- I mean
this is a great suggestion.

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:36.127 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, the
kudzu, if you get, you know,

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:38.763 align:middle line:84%
a lot of shidoobee action,
then you will have to make

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:41.933 align:middle line:84%
that apple kudzu because
you want to like to look

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:45.403 align:middle line:84%
at the more kudzu you use
then it's going to stop it up.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:46.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:48.306 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But if you
have too much situation,

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:52.344 align:middle line:84%
then you want to use less
kudzu and not as thick.

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:53.812 align:middle line:84%
>>Lisa: OK, interesting,
interesting.

00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:57.215 align:middle line:84%
We have here a picture of
your miso soup recipe which--

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.417 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing I learned to make.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:00.218 align:middle line:90%
And I'm proud of it.

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:01.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Make your own miso?

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.121 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Because I
was totally intimated, I--

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.457 align:middle line:84%
you know, I always chip ham and
ketchup white bread sandwich.

00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:06.992 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I will
make miso soup now?

00:32:06.992 --> 00:32:08.193 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:09.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I know that's why
I have-- I kind of say.

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:09.794 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: So, intimidating.

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:11.196 align:middle line:90%
But, it's not.

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:14.332 align:middle line:84%
It's just green onion which has
more vitamin C than an orange.

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:17.435 align:middle line:84%
Its C vegetable so any type
you want to put in there,

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:18.536 align:middle line:90%
you can even use the arame.

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.672 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to mention
arame as a seaweed.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:21.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:22.941 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And your
miso and I put carrots

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.776 align:middle line:90%
and shiitake or maitake.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:28.346 align:middle line:84%
And those mushrooms are powerful
because they're antiviral.

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.582 align:middle line:84%
And the maitake has
interferon in it.

00:32:30.582 --> 00:32:32.384 align:middle line:84%
Interferon is what's
in chemotherapy

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:34.452 align:middle line:90%
so why aren't we eating--

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.521 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- preventatively.

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:39.991 align:middle line:84%
So, miso soup, I think
it's a 50 percent reduction

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:43.428 align:middle line:84%
in breast cancer when you--
with people that eat miso.

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.297 align:middle line:84%
And the Japanese
healed their culture

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:50.101 align:middle line:84%
after the World War II
with wakame and miso.

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:51.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.303 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you do all
these on a budget?

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:53.471 align:middle line:90%
Is this expensive?

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.873 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Super cheap
because you're going

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:57.175 align:middle line:84%
to buy the miso and you're not
going to use it all in one day.

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:32:58.276 --> 00:32:58.977 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You're
going to use a teaspoon,

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.278 align:middle line:90%
a teaspoon in each pot.

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:01.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Does it last for a
while in those containers?

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Last a long
time, it's fermented.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.648 align:middle line:84%
It can stay in your
fridge for months.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:04.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.551 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And you're
going to buy a few ingredients

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
but then you're going
to cook simply.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.022 align:middle line:84%
You're going to cook the
way we cooked 100 years ago.

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.591 align:middle line:84%
And the way that people cook
in third world countries.

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:16.394 align:middle line:84%
They eat grains,
they eat legumes,

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:84%
they eat vegetables,
plant-based.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:23.868 align:middle line:84%
And your meat is just there
to be in a-- an enhancer.

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, the legumes
and the-- and the beans

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.805 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:33:26.805 --> 00:33:27.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Do you pre soak these?

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:29.274 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I pre
soak always my legumes.

00:33:29.274 --> 00:33:30.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The night before, the--

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.043 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Always, all
beans the night before.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:33.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why is that?

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.546 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Lentils for
like 15 minutes, I rinse them

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:36.748 align:middle line:84%
because they're easy
because you want them to--

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
you want them to cook faster.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.785 align:middle line:84%
And you want them to
be more digestible.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:43.154 align:middle line:84%
So, the longer they
sit, the easier they are

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:44.956 align:middle line:90%
to digest and then be absorbed.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:47.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, this is
something that that will help

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.394 align:middle line:84%
with the gassiness that
the beans usually--

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:50.061 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Absolutely.

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- caused.

00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:51.863 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Absolutely.

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you kind
of predigest them.

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:53.765 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In the water.

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.534 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, you-- and
that's what people always did.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:59.871 align:middle line:84%
I mean people even soak their
flowers before they use them

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:00.638 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:01.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, interesting.

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, all of these works

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.543 align:middle line:84%
if you have little
time and little money.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.112 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, it really
works if you have little time

00:34:07.112 --> 00:34:09.713 align:middle line:84%
because what it does is it
helps you get organized.

00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm organized, I
know on Sunday night,

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:90%
what I need to do for Monday.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.121 align:middle line:84%
So, I will soak the
beans on Sunday night.

00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:18.556 align:middle line:84%
And then I know Monday when
I either get up before I go

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:22.193 align:middle line:84%
to work or when I get home,
that I put my pot of beans on.

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:25.096 align:middle line:84%
Then we come home and I
build a meal around my beans.

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:26.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You're very organized.

00:34:26.463 --> 00:34:29.334 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about shopping online
or what do you know to look

00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:30.735 align:middle line:90%
for I mean how do you do that?

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you--

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.805 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I shop online
and I put in my book a list

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:90%
of websites you can shop at--

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, great.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:37.942 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: -- ingredients,
everything for your kitchen,

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:40.078 align:middle line:84%
where to get them,
the best prices

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.746 align:middle line:84%
because that was really
intimidating to me.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.415 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was the most
intimated person ever.

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.651 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to put together a book

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.587 align:middle line:84%
that someone could
take that was like me

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.289 align:middle line:90%
and say, "Oh, I got this.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.322 align:middle line:90%
This is easy."

00:34:52.322 --> 00:34:53.858 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean as I'm
thinking about it,

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:55.527 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a great cook at all.

00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:56.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:58.096 align:middle line:84%
And so, would you
recommend to someone going in

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.398 align:middle line:84%
and just clearing out their
entire refrigerator and starting

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:01.666 align:middle line:90%
over again, all those--

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:03.668 align:middle line:84%
old bottles of ketchup and
all of that jelly and--

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:06.304 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I mean in an ideal
world that would be fantastic.

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:09.574 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that and you
can just wipe it all out

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:13.278 align:middle line:84%
and you can start over and
go buy everything new, great.

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:14.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Would you
do bulk containers

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.448 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I do use
glass jars, like this jar

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.284 align:middle line:90%
that sauerkraut is in.

00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:22.921 align:middle line:84%
I would rinse in out and then
I would store my sea vegetables

00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:27.025 align:middle line:84%
in it or my grain
and I reuse jars.

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:30.228 align:middle line:84%
And I buy glass jars if I
don't have any mason jars are

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
fantastic, you can get
them at flea markets.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you store like that
and you don't buy in excess.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:39.237 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You're going
to start shopping minimally.

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:43.608 align:middle line:84%
You're going to buy three
vegetables at the farmers market

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.643 align:middle line:90%
for three meals on Sunday.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:48.346 align:middle line:84%
And then once you cook those,
go to the market on Thursday

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:84%
on your way home and pick up
two more rounds of vegetables.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.519 align:middle line:84%
And then you build
your meals around--

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:84%
you build around
plant-based eating

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:57.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:59.424 align:middle line:84%
All right now, let's
talk about kid's foods

00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:00.058 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:36:00.058 --> 00:36:00.925 align:middle line:90%
I want to go there

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.662 align:middle line:84%
I mean the kids lunch programs
in the schools completely suck.

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:05.697 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh man.

00:36:05.697 --> 00:36:07.832 align:middle line:84%
There's a situation
with the kids food

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:09.834 align:middle line:90%
and it really breaks my heart

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It does

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Because when did
we come up with the concept

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.306 align:middle line:84%
of kids food, that was
when it all fell apart.

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.841 align:middle line:90%
What is kid's food?

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.344 align:middle line:84%
Why did they now
have a whole genre?

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why is it different?

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:21.946 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Why-- what is
going on with the kid's menu?

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.047 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it is?

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:26.117 align:middle line:84%
Its limited eating,
it's catering to a child

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:30.154 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have education and
it's not empowering to them.

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:32.357 align:middle line:84%
And so, I don't believe in
kid's food, I don't believe

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:37.362 align:middle line:84%
in hiding things in foods
either because what is that?

00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're hiding
in the food

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.267 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
they're 13 or 21--

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:43.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:44.502 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: -- or 25 or 35.

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:46.738 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: They don't
want to eat it when it's

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:48.373 align:middle line:84%
in its natural form
because they never knew

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:50.008 align:middle line:90%
that they ate it anyways.

00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:51.976 align:middle line:84%
So, you're really
creating a monster

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.645 align:middle line:84%
and you're not doing
them any favor.

00:36:53.645 --> 00:36:54.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:57.181 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's the old
school, this is what I cook,

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're
having, I don't make a war.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.052 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in battles.

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not reactive to them.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.289 align:middle line:90%
Why would you get mad at them?

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:05.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, right
but they say, well,

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.893 align:middle line:84%
the kids will only pasta
and macaroni and cheese.

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:11.162 align:middle line:84%
They won't eat the
spinach and the broccoli

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:90%
if I put it around their plate

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.298 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Right, well,

00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:14.499 align:middle line:84%
that's all that you've
given them.

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:16.701 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, you have
to take responsibility.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.569 align:middle line:84%
You got to own your
parenting shoes

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:19.971 align:middle line:84%
and you got to say,
I'm the mama.

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.372 align:middle line:90%
They don't have ATM card.

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.674 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a car.

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.276 align:middle line:84%
They don't drive and they
don't have any education.

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:27.378 align:middle line:84%
So, why are they picking
what they're going to eat.

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:30.581 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to buck up,
you got to get in your kitchen.

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:33.951 align:middle line:84%
You first have to eat and cook
and eat this way for you first

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:35.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, and then--

00:37:35.153 --> 00:37:36.387 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Then once
you get good enough at it.

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.655 align:middle line:90%
Start feeding them.

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Start making the change.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.026 align:middle line:84%
Put a little on the plate and
you have to be consistent.

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:43.728 align:middle line:90%
So, with color greens--

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:47.598 align:middle line:84%
I love colors but my youngest
daughter wasn't having any part.

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't make a war.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.836 align:middle line:84%
I'd put a little bit on
her plate twice a week.

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:55.973 align:middle line:84%
Every week, twice a week, the
sauerkraut now they inhale it.

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:59.777 align:middle line:84%
Every week on their plate,
there was sauerkraut.

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.179 align:middle line:90%
They started to see it.

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:02.847 align:middle line:84%
They formed a relationship
with it.

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:03.614 align:middle line:90%
You have to take a bite.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:04.716 align:middle line:90%
You have to take one bite.

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:05.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That old school rule.

00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:06.517 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: That
they just try it.

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.618 align:middle line:90%
They finally just tried it.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, just
try it, try it, try it.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.789 align:middle line:84%
I remember the day that Lola
[assumed spelling] was like,

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.392 align:middle line:84%
"Mama, are we going
to have color green?

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:19.597 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- and I thought
it worked, it worked.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.298 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:21.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I'm a winner.

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.133 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: That's good.

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do you have
any good suggestions

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:23.968 align:middle line:84%
for lunch boxes or
kid's lunch boxes?

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:24.936 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I do, left over's

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:26.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's a
good suggestion

00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:27.572 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And what
is that make you do?

00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:28.406 align:middle line:90%
It makes you cook.

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:30.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You got a point there.

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:31.509 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You save
money, you cook dinner.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:38.516 align:middle line:84%
So, on Monday, we'll-- maybe I
do make them chicken fingers--

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:39.617 align:middle line:90%
my version.

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:41.686 align:middle line:84%
It's a minor-- its
organic chicken,

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:44.155 align:middle line:90%
its almond meal encrusted.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.456 align:middle line:90%
I'll make them on Friday.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:49.761 align:middle line:84%
That's their treat dinner
and maybe I'll do, you know,

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:50.995 align:middle line:90%
some kind of steamed broccolis.

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.865 align:middle line:84%
Steamed broccoli the next
day is fantastic cold.

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:55.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you put
them on lunch box?

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.667 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I put in the
lunch containers, Yeah.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:58.469 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
then they have that.

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:59.637 align:middle line:90%
And then they have fruit.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:00.405 align:middle line:90%
They're good

00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:01.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah

00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:03.408 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, leftovers
are the beans, the grains,

00:39:03.408 --> 00:39:06.144 align:middle line:84%
turned into burritos,
rice is fantastic.

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.279 align:middle line:84%
Heat it up in the morning,
put it in a thermos.

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.815 align:middle line:84%
Soups are wonderful
on a thermos.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.083 align:middle line:90%
Salads are super easy.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.585 align:middle line:84%
So, you do kale salad
or spinach salad.

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.888 align:middle line:84%
And I take a carrot and I
put it in a food processor

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:20.224 align:middle line:84%
and I pulse it one time and I
have crumbled carrots on spinach

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:22.527 align:middle line:84%
with the home made
dressing in a container.

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:23.194 align:middle line:90%
>>Lisa: Wow.

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:23.895 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Real.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:26.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's great.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:26.964 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: They're
eating real food.

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.399 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a conversation.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yup, it
wasn't a conversation.

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:30.868 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So, you have done the same
thing with kitchens all

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.972 align:middle line:84%
around the place where you
have these food kitchens.

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:37.108 align:middle line:84%
What are they and we have a
picture here of one of your--

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
they're community kitchens.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.046 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I-- when
I was getting well

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.116 align:middle line:84%
and I was still very
sick, that 89-pound girl.

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:49.887 align:middle line:84%
I had a moment where I
thought, oh wow, I don't want

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.823 align:middle line:90%
to tell people what to do.

00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:53.524 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
them what I do.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:54.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.827 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Because
if you tell people,

00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:57.695 align:middle line:84%
then you're pointing a
finger and no one listens.

00:39:57.695 --> 00:40:01.098 align:middle line:84%
But I thought if I just go in
to my community in Nashville

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.801 align:middle line:84%
and I set up shop, let
me show some people.

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:06.704 align:middle line:84%
So, I went into a
food desert just

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.738 align:middle line:90%
like the neighborhood I grew

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:10.141 align:middle line:84%
up in predominantly
African-American.

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:13.744 align:middle line:84%
And I connected with the
church and I went in.

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:16.581 align:middle line:84%
And I would stand there at
89 pounds and I'm bragging

00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:18.916 align:middle line:84%
about myself because
I'm proud of that girl.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would stand there and
I would make tofu, schnitzel,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.624 align:middle line:84%
and anything I could come up
with that I could try to make.

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:29.694 align:middle line:84%
And I would cook for 40 and 50
people for a dollar a person.

00:40:29.694 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually the
congregation would come

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.999 align:middle line:90%
in people started helping me.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:38.002 align:middle line:84%
And then people in the city
of Nashville heard about me.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:41.405 align:middle line:84%
And they would come and I was
cooking on the morning show

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.007 align:middle line:90%
and I'd stand and cook.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:45.176 align:middle line:84%
And I'd talk to these
kids and the families.

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.578 align:middle line:84%
And I go out in the street
and round up people to eat

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.814 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have any
food when they're hungry.

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.749 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't just get
a free meal they had

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:52.783 align:middle line:90%
to learn to cook it.

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.552 align:middle line:84%

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:07.051 align:middle line:84%
So, just the benefits of
that being out of his body is

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:11.288 align:middle line:84%
so huge that, you know, it
can't be anything but good.

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:16.861 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:20.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you made a
huge difference in his life.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So, how did he impact the room?

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.735 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: He
just shared a story

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.637 align:middle line:90%
and his story is just gigantic.

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:30.541 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, diabetes,
heart disease, 45 pounds

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.942 align:middle line:90%
and he changed his life.

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:35.646 align:middle line:84%
He came to me after being in the
hospital and he said Ms. Mee,

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.348 align:middle line:90%
that's they call me on the farm.

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.251 align:middle line:84%
"Ms. Mee, I'm ready
to change my life.

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:41.652 align:middle line:90%
What do I got to do?"

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:43.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And what
about his little boy?

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:44.789 align:middle line:90%
How was his little boy?

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:46.057 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: All
of them are great.

00:43:46.057 --> 00:43:48.025 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're amazing,
his 15 year old daughter

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:84%
by the way Ms. Bailey cooked
for her father everyday and runs

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.165 align:middle line:84%
that kitchen and
this is how they eat

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.599 align:middle line:90%
and this is how they cook.

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.868 align:middle line:84%
They have four children
and a grand baby.

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:00.438 align:middle line:84%
And they cook like
this everyday.

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:03.607 align:middle line:84%
And her and her sister Samantha
cooked him into wellness.

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:05.976 align:middle line:84%
And that was Christmas,
he was in the hospital

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.812 align:middle line:84%
on Christmas Eve
and Christmas day.

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:10.481 align:middle line:84%
And I got the text that
he was off medicines

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.551 align:middle line:84%
from his doctor on
February 28th.

00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:14.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.587 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: In two months,
all meds gone and lost

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.189 align:middle line:90%
within three months lost 45,

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:21.525 align:middle line:84%
50 pounds by June,
he was like down.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:24.628 align:middle line:84%
That was in June and it
all started in December.

00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, anyone can do this?

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:27.865 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.333 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: A 15 year old
who lives on a farm and goes

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:32.103 align:middle line:84%
to school in a Holler
in Tennessee.

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:34.138 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
not an uppity thing.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:37.575 align:middle line:84%
This is not an elides thing,
this is not a bushwa thing.

00:44:37.575 --> 00:44:38.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: This is
old school cooking for

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.011 align:middle line:90%
and cooking with a purpose.

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, absolutely
for health.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.081 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: This
is the new gourmet.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:46.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, that's why you
call these people food angels,

00:44:46.317 --> 00:44:47.418 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:48.252 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
they're my food angels.

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What's the food angel?

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.654 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, once I
started the community kitchen,

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:84%
people started coming in
from around Nashville.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.393 align:middle line:84%
And they would show up and
they say, "I want to cook,

00:44:55.393 --> 00:44:57.695 align:middle line:84%
I want to cook, I want
to learn and I'll help."

00:44:57.695 --> 00:45:01.899 align:middle line:84%
And then now I have about 20
maybe 25 people in the city

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:05.536 align:middle line:84%
of Nashville that I'll cook this
way, know how to cook this way.

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:08.639 align:middle line:84%
And here in LA I have a group
of people that have been cooking

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.007 align:middle line:90%
with me when I'm here.

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:13.377 align:middle line:84%
And they all cook this
way, they all eat this way,

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.146 align:middle line:90%
they learn new ways of cooking.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: They share recipes.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.947 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: We
all come together

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.315 align:middle line:84%
and we run our community
kitchens

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and they run each table.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.886 align:middle line:84%
And they are now
leaders in the community.

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.822 align:middle line:84%
So, a food angel it's a pay
it forward person who goes

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:27.858 align:middle line:84%
into the community and
then teaches others.

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:30.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Teachers others how to
do it and then feeds people--

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.229 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And feeds people,
yeah, we're feeding people.

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:35.132 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just giving people
canned goods in a food bank,

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.668 align:middle line:84%
why don't we set up
community kitchens

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and teach people how
to feed themselves?

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That is amazing.

00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:41.105 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:42.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:45.142 align:middle line:84%
You have this great
picture here of this--

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:46.210 align:middle line:90%
of one of your food angels.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.411 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And this
incredible dish, what is that?

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.715 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Those are, first
of all one of those food angels

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.217 align:middle line:90%
in that shot is my sister.

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:55.119 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
praise goodness.

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.454 align:middle line:84%
That is my sister
which is amazing

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.156 align:middle line:84%
because we couldn't
help our mama.

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.524 align:middle line:90%
But we help each other.

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:03.494 align:middle line:84%
And she now teaches in Nashville
and runs community kitchens.

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:05.196 align:middle line:90%
And runs that works on the farm.

00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:07.398 align:middle line:84%
And the other woman is Ms.
Jenny Mendel [assumed spelling]

00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:09.667 align:middle line:84%
who is-- has been
our farm manager.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:13.671 align:middle line:84%
And those are sweet potatoes,
turnips everything that came

00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.873 align:middle line:84%
out root vegetables,
parsley on them,

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:17.474 align:middle line:90%
olive oil, put them in the oven.

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.742 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is complicated.

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Everything that
comes out of your farm.

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:21.879 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: We eat everything.

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Which I want to
talk about that first.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.316 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that you've
shared the story with us

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:28.619 align:middle line:84%
because of course the national
news has got your attention.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:31.322 align:middle line:84%
And you've have been on various
different cooking segments.

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:33.324 align:middle line:84%
We could see a couple of
you here, you in action.

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:34.525 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh yeah.

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:35.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's important
and I think they need

00:46:35.593 --> 00:46:37.228 align:middle line:84%
to do huge stories
on people like you.

00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, I've
been a reoccurring cook

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:41.699 align:middle line:84%
on the Fox Nashville
Show [assumed spelling]

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:43.901 align:middle line:84%
and the [inaudible]
now for four years.

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:45.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh great.

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:46.637 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And I just--
yeah, and I've been cooking all

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:49.874 align:middle line:84%
over the country because my goal
is to create community kitchens

00:46:49.874 --> 00:46:52.843 align:middle line:90%
in 18 cities across the country.

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You have a huge vision
and we support you absolutely.

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:56.447 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah girl.

00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:57.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, all right,
tell me a little bit

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:58.549 align:middle line:90%
about your farm in Nashville.

00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And how you leave there?

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.886 align:middle line:84%
And the seasonal vegetables
and how you do this?

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Well we--

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.189 align:middle line:90%
my husband has had the farm

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:09.493 align:middle line:84%
as a working grass-fed
cattle ranch for 20 years.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:12.529 align:middle line:84%
And he comes from a big
family, a big food family.

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.599 align:middle line:90%
His family-- his mother's--

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:19.069 align:middle line:84%
his step father's family
started Winn-Dixie.

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:20.204 align:middle line:90%
And so, that was the first chain

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.639 align:middle line:84%
of grocery stores in
the United States.

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:22.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, this
we are a food family.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And what we've
done is changed, you know,

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.711 align:middle line:90%
the relationship with food.

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:30.581 align:middle line:84%
And so, the farm is a
grass-fed cattle ranch.

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.249 align:middle line:84%
We raise sheep hogs,
quarter horses.

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:35.386 align:middle line:84%
We have over thousand
cows at a time.

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:37.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, your husband wasn't
the meat and potatoes guy?

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.823 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: He was a
mega meat and potatoes guy.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:40.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: He was.

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:41.992 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But he
watched me get well.

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:44.094 align:middle line:84%
And he sat and he
ate my [inaudible].

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:47.064 align:middle line:84%
He was like, "Oh, it's good,"
'cause is always terrible.

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:51.168 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
need to know.

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.203 align:middle line:90%
You start out and it's terrible

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.406 align:middle line:84%
and it gets better
and you get better.

00:47:55.406 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.207 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And in through it,

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.842 align:middle line:84%
you gain this incredible
confidence.

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.377 align:middle line:90%
You know, so yeah, it's a farm

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:04.014 align:middle line:84%
and then we started the
biodynamic produce aspect

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.149 align:middle line:90%
of the gardens.

00:48:05.149 --> 00:48:06.617 align:middle line:84%
We call it the gardens,
but it's like 10 acres.

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's growing everyday and
the ranch is thousands of acres.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.955 align:middle line:90%
It's a massive ranch.

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:14.191 align:middle line:84%
So, every year we add more
acreage to the produce.

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.493 align:middle line:84%
And we started it for
my community kitchens

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:19.363 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't find
anybody to donate the food.

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:21.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I was going to ask you,
yeah, how do you support those?

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, the
community kitchens I cook

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.738 align:middle line:84%
for 40-- anywhere between 40 to
50 people upwards off 150 people

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.206 align:middle line:90%
for a dollar a person.

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.608 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And that's
because I've got cooking skills.

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And do people
donate as they come or--

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:34.845 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I had
funded the whole thing

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:35.913 align:middle line:90%
for the first few years.

00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:37.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's amazing.

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.916 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then
we started the gardens

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:43.387 align:middle line:84%
and we provide whatever we have
in the garden we cook with.

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:46.757 align:middle line:84%
And then through donation
now people just drop a dollar

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.458 align:middle line:90%
on the bucket.

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:48.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's great.

00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:49.526 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And
we figure it out,

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.094 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's how I
ate as a kid, right?

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.463 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Your mama cooked
for everybody whenever she had.

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.598 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: She
didn't turn people away.

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's when
we have communities.

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.735 align:middle line:84%
And, all right, so you Meeafy
[assumed spelling] food.

00:48:57.735 --> 00:48:58.969 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I Meeafy food.

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: These are Meeafied
[assumed spelling] food.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.172 align:middle line:84%
I have here a picture
of how you Meeafy--

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:04.241 align:middle line:84%
what is Meeafying
[assumed spelling] a dish?

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.609 align:middle line:90%
So, you take your typical--

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.544 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, I started
out in a rigid way of cooking

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.613 align:middle line:90%
in a very healthy holistic way.

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:13.117 align:middle line:84%
And then I did a
professional culinary program

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:15.419 align:middle line:84%
in French-American
Classic Cuisine.

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:19.523 align:middle line:84%
And I did it, I win in under the
radar, no one knew who I was.

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.792 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell anybody I
knew how to cook except

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.495 align:middle line:84%
for this one woman who was
like, she has watched me chop.

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:26.063 align:middle line:84%
And she was like what
are you doing here?

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.264 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh, I want to cook.

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:29.133 align:middle line:90%
I just want to cook better.

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.969 align:middle line:84%
And she-- you know, chefs
can be a little uppity.

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:33.804 align:middle line:84%
If they think you think
you know anything,

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.606 align:middle line:90%
they don't like you at all.

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:37.908 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was like nothing,
I'm just going to cook better,

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:40.010 align:middle line:84%
she was like, I think
you're a spy and I was.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.149 align:middle line:84%
And I would just sit there and
I would take everything she said

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.985 align:middle line:84%
and everything we learned
and I would go home.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:51.722 align:middle line:84%
And I would Meeafy it, I
would change the fat content.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:55.893 align:middle line:84%
If ever it required dairy and a
cream sauce, I would find a way

00:49:55.893 --> 00:50:00.197 align:middle line:84%
to make a bechamel sauce
with a nut milk or--

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:02.466 align:middle line:84%
and I really learn
how to change things.

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:05.536 align:middle line:84%
And if it was gluten-free
I would figure out how

00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:08.839 align:middle line:84%
to combine the grains and the
flowers so that it would have

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.208 align:middle line:84%
that type of texture
and not be too sweet.

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:15.813 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I would
change-- if we made meatloaf,

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:17.548 align:middle line:90%
just throwing that in there.

00:50:17.548 --> 00:50:18.682 align:middle line:90%
We didn't really make meatloaf.

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.717 align:middle line:84%
But what I would so is I
would add sea vegetables

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:22.686 align:middle line:90%
to it and almond meal.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:26.056 align:middle line:84%
And I would just try to boost
it, try to make it as good-free

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:29.293 align:middle line:84%
as you can with an old
school recipe, and shift it

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:30.427 align:middle line:90%
so that everyone can eat it.

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:31.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that's
what the cook book is.

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:32.596 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: That's what it is.

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:33.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's Meeafying things.

00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:34.732 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I just
Meeafied it all.

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:37.801 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'll go, "Oh
really, I can do that."

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.837 align:middle line:84%
Well you did, here's
a great recipe here

00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:41.371 align:middle line:90%
that I'm sure this-- oh.

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:44.408 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you the last time
I've ever had chicken pot pie

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.776 align:middle line:90%
because everything in life--

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:46.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:47.811 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I'm
completely allergic to.

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, you can have it,

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:51.081 align:middle line:84%
you can have chicken
pot pie anymore.

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:51.982 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: We can.

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:52.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:53.817 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And my sister

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:54.618 align:middle line:84%
and I actually this
is a great example

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.019 align:middle line:90%
of what we do in my farm.

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.955 align:middle line:84%
So, we pull from the garden
and we also have chickens

00:50:57.955 --> 00:50:59.756 align:middle line:90%
so I have my own chickens.

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.658 align:middle line:84%
So, we-- let's make
chicken pot pie.

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:05.762 align:middle line:84%
So, she went and made the rolled
out old school go from wheat

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:08.098 align:middle line:90%
and then I made my version.

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.167 align:middle line:90%
And I added hijiki sea weed.

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.969 align:middle line:84%
I added-- I use the
kudzu to thicken it.

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:14.605 align:middle line:84%
So, it was going to
support the digestive track

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:15.873 align:middle line:84%
because you have cheese
starch to thicken it.

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And then my crust is
an almond meal crust.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.245 align:middle line:90%
So, I took almond meal

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:24.815 align:middle line:84%
and I added green
onions and fresh parsley.

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:27.651 align:middle line:84%
And I put it all into food
processes and I crumbled it

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:90%
and I made in a skillet.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, iron skillet, yeah.

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.558 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then the top
layer is this yummy crumble.

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.493 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out everybody
on the farm loved it,

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.295 align:middle line:90%
because we do farm Fridays.

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:41.098 align:middle line:84%
Cowboy luncheons and we
feed everybody on the farm.

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:41.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can I come
live with you?

00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:42.966 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah, come on.

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You can have
such a good time.

00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:45.502 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I do and
we have a lot of funny.

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:46.703 align:middle line:90%
That's a thing about the South.

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:47.604 align:middle line:90%
People are funny.

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:48.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:49.573 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: We-- we're
not afraid to be silly

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:51.475 align:middle line:90%
and we're not afraid to fail.

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, I've seen
some of your videos.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And you crack me up, your
YouTube channel is hilarious.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.681 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Hilarious.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's chasing
cows and singing, its fun.

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:01.385 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:02.486 align:middle line:90%
So, here's another example

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.922 align:middle line:84%
of your vegan creamy
tomato vodka sauce

00:52:04.922 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:90%
which is a lot of words.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.258 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh yeah, well,
how is it being about being

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:10.761 align:middle line:84%
in that class of program
the chef keep telling me,

00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:12.829 align:middle line:84%
no you can change it,
you can change it.

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.199 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You-- it
doesn't work and I would say,

00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:16.700 align:middle line:84%
well could I, could
I-- so, then I just had

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.535 align:middle line:84%
to prove it wrong
in my own kitchen.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:21.705 align:middle line:84%
And this I thought I
missed cream of tomato soup.

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:24.975 align:middle line:84%
See, I was a processed food
person, I wanted a pot pie,

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.678 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the creamy
tomato Campbell soup

00:52:27.678 --> 00:52:28.745 align:middle line:90%
and so with cheese.

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Integral cheese.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.647 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Integral cheese

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.516 align:middle line:84%
and so I wanted the
whole comfort thing.

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:36.153 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I did to this
is its tomatoes, its water,

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.721 align:middle line:90%
its garlic, its onion.

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:38.989 align:middle line:90%
You can have basil if you want.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.626 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then the miso
makes it cheesy and creamy.

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.795 align:middle line:84%
And then you can add a
little nutritional yeast

00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:46.029 align:middle line:90%
to take it another level.

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's not hard.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:48.966 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And then I
put rice in it or millet

00:52:48.966 --> 00:52:52.903 align:middle line:84%
or quinoa to-- while you cook
it all before you puree it

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:54.404 align:middle line:90%
which makes it thick.

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:56.139 align:middle line:84%
So, that's how you
make a creamy soup

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:58.442 align:middle line:90%
without dairy you add a grain.

00:52:58.442 --> 00:53:01.845 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not doing a
grain then you can add tofu

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.714 align:middle line:84%
if you want to and
then you puree it all.

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:04.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Puree it.

00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:05.916 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, I
usually add and you--

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.784 align:middle line:84%
if you're watching your
carbohydrate grains

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.686 align:middle line:84%
like you're diabetic
you use millet.

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:11.888 align:middle line:84%
Millet is the best
grain for diabetics.

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:13.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wow, you're really
put a lot of this together.

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.025 align:middle line:90%
So, this is all in the book--

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.126 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: All in the book.

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:17.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: A wonderful
picture of the cute--

00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:19.796 align:middle line:84%
you have a great
graphic artist which is--

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.431 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh yeah, Ted
raised in San Francisco.

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:22.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's a lot of fun.

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:24.234 align:middle line:84%
All right so we're going to
take a look here at this video.

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.702 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at your farm.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:26.904 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: All right.

00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:35.979 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.489 align:middle line:84%
Learning to cook food was
one thing but learning how

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:48.859 align:middle line:84%
to grow food so it supported
the body was another thing.

00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:52.062 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about what's in
the food and in the recipes.

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:55.599 align:middle line:84%
It's what-- how the food is
grown and what's in the soil?

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:57.367 align:middle line:90%
And what's in the water.

00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:59.736 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is an
ancestral farm.

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:02.439 align:middle line:84%
We've taken the way we
farm all the way back.

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.308 align:middle line:84%
This is a new age,
this is old school.

00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:06.276 align:middle line:84%
This is the way we
use to grow food.

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.111 align:middle line:84%
So, our soil has
lots of bugs in it

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:10.714 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want
to kill the bugs.

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:11.448 align:middle line:90%
We want the bugs.

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:12.816 align:middle line:90%
The bugs are getting me.

Because bugs in your soil means
healthy soil and it's alive.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.255 align:middle line:84%
And you want to eat
food that's alive.

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:21.058 align:middle line:84%
We the way that we
plant our food here is

00:54:21.058 --> 00:54:22.559 align:middle line:90%
in unison with the seasons.

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:26.496 align:middle line:84%
Because when food is grown and
it's right time and it's eaten

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:29.166 align:middle line:84%
in its right time then
the body benefits.

00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:32.936 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies eating
seasonally is the ticket.

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.639 align:middle line:84%
So, we pick and we grow food
and we sell it in market

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.007 align:middle line:90%
and we sell it seasonally.

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.642 align:middle line:84%
And it teaches you
to cook better

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.511 align:middle line:84%
because you're always
inspired as the seasons change.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:44.314 align:middle line:84%
It shifts the way you eat and
you have a whole new menu plan

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.816 align:middle line:90%
with what's grown in here.

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:49.186 align:middle line:84%
We'll use any pesticides,
we don't use any herbicides

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:51.154 align:middle line:84%
and we don't-- and
we use organic seeds.
