00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Wouldn't you
love to know your future?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just take
it one step further.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you love to
write your future?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:84%
According to "New York Times"
bestselling-author and psychic

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and Akashic record expert
Sandra Anne Taylor,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
your future is actually being
written by you every day.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:10%
In her latest book,
"Accessing Spiritual

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:10%
Patterns to Rewrite
Your Akashic Records,"

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:10%
Sandra teaches how to
learn about the library

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:10%
of all lifetimes, which
is the Akashic records,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.387 align:middle line:10%
plus how you can tap
into and rewrite them

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:10%
for a better future.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:90%
I love this topic.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA ANNE TAYLOR:
Oh, thank you.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:10%
I love it too,
and I was inspired

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:10%
to write about it because there
was so much to get from it--

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
past, present, and future, and
even talents and creativity.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.727 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to write the
book, "The Akashic Records."

00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you've
written a lot of books.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.622 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, yes.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A lot of books.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I just brought a
few from the Johnny years

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:90%
of my time with Hay House.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that our
future isn't predestined.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.737 align:middle line:90%
We're not following some path.

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It's already been written
out for us, right?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The future exists in
energetic potential,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and that energetic potential is
based on the karmic influences

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
we bring into this life
and our present decisions,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
our present thoughts,
our life force energy.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And that creates the future
in terms of what exists now

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
creates a future potential.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:10%
So once we get to know
the future potential--

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:10%
and in my book, "The
Akashic Records,"

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:10%
I have a session on viewing
the potential outcomes.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like it,
you can change your energy.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.042 align:middle line:84%
And once you change your
energy, you change the outcome.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's how you do it.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
you rewrite it.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So this is also using--
we have a book, this "Quantum

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:10%
Success."

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:10%
You use this idea of
the quantum realities

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:10%
to rearrange your future.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, I really
got into quantum physics

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, and
I felt that it really

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
could explain the
human condition

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and human experiences.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized when I
studied consciousness fields

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that the Akashic or Akashic
records are literally

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
a huge consciousness field
of all the information.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
Akashic records.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I have mine.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But we have a shared record
of all humanity and, in fact,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:90%
of the world itself.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And the energy and the
information that exists there,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that's people find
scientific discovery.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
People learn about what they
want to do as their purpose.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the records.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always imagined
this giant library

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
in the sky with
miles-high Florida ceiling

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
records and these
librarians floating around

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.565 align:middle line:90%
on these ladders.

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Spirit
librarians, yes.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Spirit
librarians-- that's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:90%
just my crazy imagination.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No, it's true.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see it so much
in the sky as in the heart.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the heart.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The heart to me
is the seed of the soul.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do meditations,
I drop the consciousness

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:90%
into the heart.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And your hall of
records is there.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Your sacred temple is there.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Your purpose is there.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything and as
well as connecting

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit that are in the
records and in your daily life,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.998 align:middle line:90%
they're all around you.

00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen
many surveys saying

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
that the top thing that
people are looking for

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is their purpose, to connect
to some type of purpose

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of their life
or to motivate their life.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And does the Akashic
records help with that?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
There's different
kinds of purposes.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.442 align:middle line:84%
First, there's your
personal purpose,

00:04:07.442 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
then there's your
spiritual purpose, then

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
your professional purpose.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are confused
about one or all of those.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But you bring in your
soul's intention,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and your soul's intention can
show you your eternal purpose.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that,
all three can align.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It's so wonderful when you're
personal, professional, and

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.577 align:middle line:90%
soul intention aligns.

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think you
call that success.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.728 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, that's success.

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:36.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
when it all aligns.

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That is
real success, yes.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and you're
doing what you love,

00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're making money at
it, and it helps other people,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.763 align:middle line:90%
and I see that as success.

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk--
well, first of all,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.972 align:middle line:84%
I want to let you all know, stay
tuned to the end of the show

00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
because Sandra's going to be
doing a wonderful meditation

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.702 align:middle line:84%
to help you discover
your purpose

00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
through the Akashic
record reading.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:90%
So stay with me to the end.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So the idea-- you started
off as a psychologist, right?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, yes, I did.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching people
about their patterns,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
their anxiety, their
depression, that type of thing,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I got into
studying quantum physics.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And I read everything that I
could possibly get my hands on.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
teaching it to my clients,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and they said,
well, where can we

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
get a book on how this
applies to human life?

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't
any at the time,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
although since then
I found out that back

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
at the turn of the
century, not this past one,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
but the 19th and 20th
century there was.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But I wrote my first
book because I really

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
wanted to tell people how their
life force energy moves out

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, oh, just
think about what you want.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Picture it.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But it really responds to
your whole life force energy.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize what
you want all you want.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're constantly
criticizing yourself

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
or constantly engaging in
self-dishonoring choices,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
then that actually
precedes those images.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it negate
it, but it precedes it.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you
always known-- well,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
when you were in your
psychology practice,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
did you also get intuitive
hits, psychic hits?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, yes.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I remember many, many
of my clients freaked out.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Are you reading my mind?

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
You're telling me this and that.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that I felt
I was reading their mind,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:90%
just things would come to me.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.505 align:middle line:84%
But that is something that
went back to childhood.

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I was born
a twin, an identical twin,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and we read each
other's thoughts

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and finished each
other's sentences

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and had many occasions where
we would be miles apart

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and knew what was happening.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were actually
used to it, and it

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
was only we went to
high school or college

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
when we realized that the
whole rest of the world

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
didn't have that experience.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But I want to add a
little caveat here.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be a
twin or special in any way

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:90%
to really connect with spirit.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:90%
You already are special.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:90%
You are an eternal soul.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just that that kind of
brought a natural tendency out

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
in us.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or to connect
with another--

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and your sister
were together since birth.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I've felt this with
other friends and other people

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:90%
where were on--

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Oh yeah, it
happens all the time.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's definitely possible
you combined fields,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and your fields were combined.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about--

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's called
phase entanglement

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in quantum physics.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I like it.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.218 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:34.385 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's a real thing.

00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: All this
stuff, people think

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:90%
it's just new age mumbo jumbo.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But it is really
based in science.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're in
this phase entanglement

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
right now where we're combining
our energies to communicate

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and present
informations that really

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
help people change and grow.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're on the same
page and the same mission

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, absolutely.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
phase entanglement.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you went
to high school, you

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
realized that it wasn't
like that for everyone else?

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, but we had a
very loving and kind of weird

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:90%
So we picked up tarot cards.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Sharon started first, and I'd
pick them up a few years later.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go to family
reunions, and people would be

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:90%
giving readings to each other.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we started
into the whole metaphysical

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How fun.

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:23.255 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It was.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like, kind of
feels like a gypsy family,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
but probably not
traveling so much, right?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No, no traveling, just
a big, loving, Italian family--

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, got it.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.581 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --where you can't come
or go without getting a kiss

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.381 align:middle line:90%
and a hug and--

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.673 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Digging into your life.

00:08:36.673 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: --and a pizza pie.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that works.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.252 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that
you used to help

00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
other people in
high school, then,

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
with their lives and situations

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, and
mostly in college

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I did some readings for people.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing to me
how the information came.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was using
the Rider-Waite tarot deck

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
because there wasn't
anything else out there.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
But I would foresee some things,
and they eventually came true.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, well,
there's some real substance

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to this stuff.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you hear
when you hear messages?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I don't hear
in my physical ears.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I hear it in my head.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
People think that they're not
connecting with spirit if they

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%
don't actually hear the words.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%
But you hear it in your head.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You see it in your head.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of
the imagination,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
people often think

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're making it up.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.705 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: But it's not.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where their brain
forms the pictures.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what I hear
is just a word or two

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.585 align:middle line:90%
or a phrase or guidance or--

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you've
been working with it

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
for so long, you just
automatically spit it out,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in the mode, if--
like, I'm in that energy now.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But as I go through my
daily life, I'll get hits.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, don't take
that road, there's

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
a traffic jam or
something like that.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But I don't get into
other people's energy

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in my daily life
unless they asked me to.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it true that people
that are able to hear spirit

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
can either hear it
or see it or there's

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
different ways of receiving
it for different people?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Clairvoyance is seeing.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Clairaudience is hearing.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Clairsentience is knowing.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
others, but I won't

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
get into all the details--

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:90%
the five senses.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Usually you start with one,
and then as you do it more

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and more-- at
first I just heard,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and then I started to see,
and then I started to smell

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and even taste and
know, obviously--

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
clairsentience.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So it expands as you work
with it and as you trust it.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
See, a lot of people get stuff
and then they don't trust it

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and they think, oh,
I'm making it up

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:84%
or I can't believe this, and
then the door kind of closes.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you really have fun with
it, get into it, and trust it,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
it expands into all senses.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would say
that's true for 99% of us

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.655 align:middle line:84%
that the door closes and we
just think it's imagination

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
and we write it off.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right, right.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And everything else

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.685 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, just weird.

00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Synchronistic, yeah,
but you really work with it.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I can just see
this picture of you

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.075 align:middle line:84%
and your sister in high
school doing readings

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:22.338 align:middle line:90%
for people on the lunch tables.

00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No, we went
to a Catholic school.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So no, no, that didn't
happen in school.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did you
use this for your life

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
in terms of maybe getting
married or having children?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And how did that
work for your life?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well,
it's interesting.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
When I was going through
my second divorce--

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I've had lots of interesting
experiences in this life--

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself, I'm going
to-- and this was already in--

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I was already into
quantum physics.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So I said to
myself, I'm only 30.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be dating people.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to date someone sane.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's the preference.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, let's put some
intention out into the field.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So I created this attracting
love meditation for myself

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
where I just sent out my highest
energy into the energetic field

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
into time and space
where it would

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
connect with the ideal person
and then come back to me,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
meet that person

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in the right time and place.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And it happened.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I swore I'd never
get married again,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:90%
but I met my third husband.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, and that worked.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And then you had children.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I adopted two
children from Russia.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And man, did I use spirit
and the records for that

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
be very conscious.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
People adopt and
they don't realize

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
they could be getting a
lot of difficult energy.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to really be
conscious about connecting

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:90%
with the right souls.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And every night I
would talk to Raphael,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
who's the angel of
family connection

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and also of the heart
center, and say, connect me

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:90%
with the right people.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And then I would get guidance.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Like, go to this meeting.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
the magazine, and that

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:90%
had the agency I went to.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept
asking for direction,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.943 align:middle line:84%
and these fluky
things would happen.

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this how we can

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Everyone can

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can use it for things

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
finding, even picking the
right stock, finding a new job.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you want to
use it for, you can use it.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this how you
rewrite your future?

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You
rewrite your future

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
or you write your future
by directing your intention

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
into your future
records, and then

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you make sure you support
it with your daily life.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I want
to write the intention

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to find really supportive
love for myself

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and a marriage or a
lifetime relationship.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But then if I don't
support myself,

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
then the present records
don't support that energy

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
expanding in the future.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So you really have
to be conscious of,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
yes, you can write the future.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%
You can map out the future.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, "The
Akashic Records,"

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:90%
there's a soul's map process.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You can map it all out,
but you must support it

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:90%
in your daily life.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is a
soul map process?

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:90%
That sounds interesting.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The soul map process
is very interesting because it

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:90%
shows you--

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
if you have a couple
decisions, you

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
can ask to see your
soul's map, and you can--

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I did this with my second
husband, who was a nice guy,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't turn out.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:90%
It didn't turn out.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We were still friends all
the way throughout our lives.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But what I did was I did--
so I pictured the map,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and you actually picture a GPS,
and it takes you on streets.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But you get words like "turn
back now" or "go ahead"

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
or-- and I got words
with my second husband

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
like "international travel,"
"expanding intellect,"

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:90%
"achievement."

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa,
this is the right guy.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And I
married him, and he

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
was the one that turned
me on to quantum physics.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so even though
we ended up getting divorced,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
we stayed friends, but it
brought international travel,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.648 align:middle line:84%
great abundance to my life,
and achievement in many arenas.

00:15:54.648 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that interesting?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so I have so
much gratitude for that.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And the soul's map took
me through that experience

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
even though it didn't end up
to be what I thought it meant.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.122 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there was still a
certain contract that you had

00:16:10.122 --> 00:16:11.205 align:middle line:90%
with a certain agreement--

00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:12.247 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:12.247 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that you got
together to accomplish or to do

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.815 align:middle line:90%
and then move on from.

00:16:16.815 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No judgment.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No judgment.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we were
able to stay friends.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is I had
this expansion in my life.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
When I started writing
about quantum physics

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and just having books
printed in so many languages

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and going around the
world to teach it,

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
that expansion filled
the place where

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
there were little pieces
missing in that relationship.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to go
on our separate ways

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.357 align:middle line:90%
in really good energy.

00:16:52.357 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But he showed up for you
at that time for that reason.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: At the
exact right time.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is so amazing.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have judgement
around relationships

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:84%
working out or not,
but that really

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:90%
was an interesting contract.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Is that how it works with our--

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:10%
I want to say with
our life, but you

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.592 align:middle line:10%
can live your life at the effect
of it or you can affect it.

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.133 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we're just living
our life and looking at things

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
happening to us constantly,
there's a certain victimization

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that goes with that, thinking,
oh, I'm the victim of this,

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.385 align:middle line:84%
I was born with
the wrong family,

00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I never was raised with
money and all these things,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and then you can actually go
into it more of an empowering

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.095 align:middle line:90%
conversation--

00:17:30.095 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and
start to affect it.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, and this is
something that I'd really like

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to focus on because
after "The Secret"

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and some of the law
of attraction stuff--

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
there's many laws
of attraction--

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
whenever anything bad happened,
people blamed themselves.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is pointless,
that self-blame,

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that victimization, I've
done something wrong,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:90%
I can't change it.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:90%
That just keeps you stuck.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
do when we realize,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm in a place where
I don't want to be,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:90%
where do I go from here?

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:90%
How do I reclaim my power?

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
How do I understand
my next best step?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is almost
always funneled

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
through the understanding
of your spiritual identity.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I am eternal.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I am powerful.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:90%
I am valuable and deserving.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I come
from that place, I

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
can really figure
out my next best step

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and let the rest go and just
figure out, all right, what

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.093 align:middle line:90%
did I learn from that, and--

00:18:32.093 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going
to say, what about--

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --take it

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.882 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Sometimes
it's karmic, and that's

00:18:47.882 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
interesting to look at too.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of work with
past lives in the records

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and the past lives
that are coded.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
something that's karmic,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
sometimes and oftentimes
it just repeats itself

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:90%
in our patterns--

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
behavioral, cognitive,
emotional patterns.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when we hit
an obstacle, we

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:90%
can look at what is the lesson?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
What pattern do I
need to change here?

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's about
self-love, self-priority,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.543 align:middle line:90%
setting boundaries.

00:19:20.543 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or we hit the pattern
over and over and over again

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and we think that, again,
it's been done to us.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%

We're riding it into the

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.543 align:middle line:90%

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
visualize yourself walking
away from the tribunal

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
or the judgment
and say, I'm free

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and I can practice my
spiritual arts and it's safe.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you support
it in your present life

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:90%
even with affirmations.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It's safe and comfortable for me
to practice my spiritual arts,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
even--

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and for this, this
was a big one for you.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's safe and comfortable
for me to go public

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:84%
with my spiritual practice
and my spiritual beliefs.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And that just expands the
energy of your intention,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and then it shifts
that energy, and you

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
don't have to go through
that difficulty anymore.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But yet, I would be
showing up and being

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:90%
criticized for what I do.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.768 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:20:50.768 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's all
repeating a pattern.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It does repeat, and sometimes
we have karmic connections,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's sometimes it's even
the same people from those lives

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that still have the memory
of having some sort of power

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%
over you.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to shake it
off, maybe rewrite it

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:84%
again, or at least
do some affirmations

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and know I am
reclaiming my power.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:90%
This is not going to own me.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My producer, Gina,
has that same lifetime

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:90%
of that witch burning.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I think she's heard that
several times before.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it's no doubt we
were there together, right?

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You absolutely were
going through that together.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You hear that, Gina?

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's so true.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So we take that information
and then rewrite it

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
so that we're safe in bringing
our spiritual mission, which

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is bringing consciousness into
the mainstream, to the world

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
safely without being criticized
for it and judged for it

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and being supported
for it and actually

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
having people support and
understand and really grow

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:90%
from the mission.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
you do it-- and I'm

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:90%
sure you've noticed this.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
As you've as you've
done it more and more,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
you've gathered more
supportive people.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
There's more energy
in your life in terms

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of people
that are supporting you,

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
the amount of venues that
you have to express this.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And that will increase.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean-- clearing
the karma doesn't mean

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:90%
you'll never have an incident.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But you just don't
have to be owned by it.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be crushed by it.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be fearful of it.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a collective
group of us, you know?

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of thousands
of people in this consciousness

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:84%
movement that want to
bring their card reading,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
their practice,
their information

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
into the mainstream,
leaning, tipping it

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
over the 100-million mark, which
is the tipping point kind of.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
us in this movement

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.167 align:middle line:84%
of personal development,
spirituality, new age, whatever

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on
for a long time.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not just me.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously people
watching these shows.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, absolutely.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us did share
that witchcraft thing

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and did share, if not that, some
persecution for our beliefs.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we have come
together because we

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
have a shared intention,
a shared karmic intention

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to expand this in the world
because it was shut down

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:90%
for us in the past.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Our soul longs for this.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, a shared tribe.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.235 align:middle line:84%
Hey, could you do
a reading for us?

00:23:26.235 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: A reading?

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:90%
For you?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The collective tribe

>>LISA: You think?

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You want
a card reading--

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --or a
psychic reading?

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which would you prefer?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.165 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, I don't care.

00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
We can pull a few
cards, and then I'll--

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
usually I do psychic readings
when I do phone readings,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.343 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes I'll pull a
few cards and see what--

00:23:59.343 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing you
can do this remotely.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
You have that ability to just
listen to people's voice.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, I actually
just tune into the voice

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and create the
intention ahead of time.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.377 align:middle line:84%
So we can tune
into everybody's--

00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's do it.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: --spiritual voice.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.913 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's do it.

00:24:13.913 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, do we grab the cards?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.102 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is gorgeous.

00:24:17.102 --> 00:24:18.255 align:middle line:90%
So this is the beautiful--

00:24:18.255 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's the

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Energy Oracle card
deck-- really beautiful.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'll represent the
collective group of us,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the light workers,
the tribe of people

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that really want to make
a difference in humanity

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and by making a difference
in individual people's lives

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
with our planet, with our
world, with the humanity on it,

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
with conscious media.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And even
the unconscious media.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.168 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, because
that's what light workers do.

00:24:49.168 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Right now, that's
a big, big group to handle.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're here to handle that.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, bring it on.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.305 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what is--

00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So just
pick three cards or--

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I will
pick the three

00:25:03.365 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
cards for our collective group.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:10%
This is third chakra.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, wonderful.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Pick them all and I'll
see what order they go in.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, you're
picking angel cards.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, good.

00:25:18.106 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, OK.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:90%
So what Lisa has picked--

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and I believe they're going
to be able to show this.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The first card is Chamuel,
the angel of the third chakra.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the chakra of life force.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because a lot of life force

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is kind of split now.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.797 align:middle line:84%
There's a polarity in the
world, not just in our country--

00:25:45.797 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: --but in the world.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
from things happening

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, a
difference in opinion.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, some people
are losing their enthusiasm.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Their third chakra is the life
force, our enthusiasm for like.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Becoming apathetic.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, yes.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And becoming almost
resigned-- like,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:90%
what can I do that can help?

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But we can
create a shared intention.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:90%
We can pray.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:90%
We can join.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I do this on
my Hay House radio show.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I do prayer vortexes
where we share--

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
everyone all over the world
does a vortex of intention

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.673 align:middle line:84%
for either their cause
or a joint cause.

>>TAYLOR: So this is
telling us that-- but see,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Chamuel came up upright.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.425 align:middle line:90%
So we still have hope.

00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
If the card comes reverse,
it's really, really bad.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But he's coming upright, as
all these cards are, and he

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
is saying that we can, just
even in our little communities,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
our families, our
homes, our workplaces,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we can help to raise the
enthusiasm in the world.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No, Chamuel
was followed by Metatron.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Metatron is what I call
one of the big guns.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Metatron is
the angel of the crown

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
chakra and really the
source of where we connect,

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
we connect with
spirit, and where

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
all of the Akashic records
information comes in.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.955 align:middle line:84%
You open that door,
and it brings power.

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
It brings power to your hands.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling there
are a lot of healers

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that need to trust the
power in their energy

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:90%
or in the energy they channel.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying,
trust what you get.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're doing
intuitive readings,

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
doing healings, shamanism,
just broadcasting

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
information, whatever it
is, whether you're doing it

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
on a personal or a
global level, it's

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
important to know that
the angels and the records

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:90%
are with you.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
So trust that.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, interestingly enough,
we got the patience card.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And so we have to connect.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.549 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, no more patience.

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I know.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
People hate getting
the patience card.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But I had a client who
recently loved getting it

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because it told him
not to leave his job,

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:90%
and then he got a promotion.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So here's what it--

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and always we might have
to wait a little longer

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
to get some of the imbalance
that is sucking the energy out

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of the third chakra, get
some of that imbalance out.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the angel
is holding a clock.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the clock is we can
do this around the clock.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
As we fall asleep, we can
prayer for all the people

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that have no one
to pray for them.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
We can send light to
the people in charge

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of all the governments.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:90%
We can do this around the clock.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that
with patience--

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting goose bumps.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%
This is so powerful.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:90%

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I said
at the beginning,

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the energetic
potential brings it

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
closer because a shift in our
energy and the group energy

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:90%
brings it to us.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really
requires practicing

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:90%

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.705 align:middle line:84%
All the incredible people that

00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:90%

>>TAYLOR: Oh, so many talents

so much self-doubt.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:10%
And it's sometimes based in
how they were brought up.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's a past life
where they were discouraged.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:90%
But let's get out of that.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's call on these angels--

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Metatron, Chamuel.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Michael comes in here, Raphael,
the angel of the heart center.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:90%
All these angels can help.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
People dismiss
the angels as just

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:90%
being some religious fantasy.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:90%
They are powerful entities.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
angel of communication?

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Angels can
communicate in many ways.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I will hear words.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I'll just see a color.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm talking to someone
and I'll see a red color,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll know Michael is with them.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Michael is red in my eyes.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that
the colors are all

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:90%
the same for different people.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to trust what you get.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And they come and tell
you, I'm supporting you.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And Michael is the angel of
strength, security, foundation.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I think
there was one.

Was it Raphael or
was it Michael that

that you want to expand
any kind of communication.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.480 align:middle line:90%
You'll get ideas.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Keep a notebook by your
bed because in your dreams

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and your meditations
you'll get ideas,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just one
word or one image,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:84%

give you expansion

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:90%
of the knowledge, the wisdom.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can write
a little intention

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
as you're falling asleep
that I sleep peacefully

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and comfortably
through the night

that I can remember
and understand.

Write that at the
top of your page.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:84%

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Our souls have come together.

As I said, we have

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:90%
not all of us.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But those of us seeking, many
of us have been through that.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So we come together with
the shared intention

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
to bring this to a new level.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's just
this power that is increasing.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's increasing
exponentially

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
because our intentions,
our intentions,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:90%
are actions in the universe.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.422 align:middle line:84%

understand what they intend.

00:32:38.422 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
don't know they

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:90%
have conflicting intentions.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:84%
An intention like I
want to expand this

and the universe is a
very powerful intention.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%

really not a good

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
We did a certified online
card video seminar.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And my sister, Sharon Klingler,
and Colette Baron-Reid and Kyle

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Gray and other
people were involved,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very lengthy
discussion on how to read

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
cards, how to develop
your five senses,

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the science behind
card reading, and--

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
science behind it?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, it's
quantum physics.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Oh my gosh, that was
a whole hour session I did.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so if we're
going to do a reading,

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.267 align:middle line:84%
tell me what the
science would be.

00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The science is
that your intention goes

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
into the energy of the shuffle,
and there's a quantum point--

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a point where your
connection with spirit--

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:90%
they help to order the cards.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Your intention orders the cards.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing a
reading for someone else,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:90%
it brings in future potential.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts of
stuff about deja vu and time

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
travel that we don't
have time to get into.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or not, you
can travel into the future,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and that will affect
the cards you pull.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So basically
when someone picks up

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.637 align:middle line:84%
a deck of your
cards, they can start

00:34:44.637 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to do these
readings on themselves, right?

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.781 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Oh,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:34:49.781 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's by
setting the intention

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.572 align:middle line:84%
and having the intention
go through the card deck.

00:34:53.572 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, and asking
spirit to help order them

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:90%
and the shuffle and--

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.077 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it comes with a
little book that help you talk

00:35:01.077 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, there's a guide
book in that and in the Akashic

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.685 align:middle line:90%
Tarot, our other deck.

00:35:07.685 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you can also
look in-- this is a great way

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.125 align:middle line:84%
to discover your
own Akashic record.

00:35:12.125 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have people that pull a
card each day, and on this deck

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.355 align:middle line:84%
there's affirmations, and it
tells you what to focus on.

00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And on the Akashic
Tarot, there is

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Akashic energy, an Akashic
force, like empowering yourself

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and little technique
on how to do that.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So yes, people do it every day.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I get emails-- you wouldn't
believe how accurate this is.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through this, and
this is the card I pulled.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
interesting because--

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I like how you equate it
to the quantum physics.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You're really using the
intentionality of your field.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Right, of your
field and the field of spirit

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.073 align:middle line:84%
and the field of the
potential future.

00:35:53.073 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, I
would draw my own card

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.823 align:middle line:84%
and then you would tell
me right now what it says.

00:35:56.823 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, if we were to
do a reading on me--

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and then
I'll draw my card,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.163 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
tell me what it says.

00:36:03.163 --> 00:36:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, if
people have these,

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:84%
they can do their own
readings on themselves.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, they can start
by reading the guide book.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
one just fell.

00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Usually when something
falls out, it's a message.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, what does that say?

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, this is the
door to love and value.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's my
theme this year.

00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: This is the
door to love and value.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So there is a new
beginning where

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
your expression or experience
of love is going to expand.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going on a
new path regarding

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
expressing or experiencing
love for yourself.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It could be in
your relationship.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It could be in your job
or bringing it to others.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My personal value--

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
every year I pick a
theme for my life,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and this theme this
year is to value myself

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:90%
higher than I ever have before.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And that's
self-love too.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's I know
the way you show up

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:90%
is the way others will see you.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the more
I value myself,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
the more others will see me and
recognize me for that value.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That is a key
quantum physical element.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The how
you see and treat

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and talk to yourself
is reflected

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the world.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.335 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's not punitive.

00:37:20.335 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so true.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's just energetic.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is so true.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
though, the universe

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:84%
will throw obstacles in
your way to test that.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we're
not going to value you,

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to do this or
we're going to do that or--

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.713 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Will you explain that?

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.428 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That is actually
just residual karmic stuff,

00:37:38.428 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's not so much the
universe is testing you.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.595 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Testing-- it's not?

00:37:41.595 --> 00:37:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's am I really
going to finish this?

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:90%
This is just popping up.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like weeds in a garden.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the weed
was planted before,

00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and am I really going to make
my love and value more important

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and really attack this weed?

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do I do, just
throw it out, pull it up,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:90%
throw it out?

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.198 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Throw it out.

00:38:06.198 --> 00:38:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize yourself
getting rid of it,

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.120 align:middle line:90%
pushing it off the road, and--

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, burning it.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, burning it.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I often give it to--

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I often visualize an
angel circle around me,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm having something,
an issue that keeps popping up

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that bothers me, I
just kind of take it--

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.830 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in my
gut, my heart, my head,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of pull it all
up and hand it to the circle,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and I just let myself see them
take it to the energetic realm

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:84%
where they will dissolve
it and work on it and--

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I don't have

>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so once again, I'm going

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:90%
my intention is my next step.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:10%
And I ask the
guides and my angels

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:10%
to help me communicate
to me the next step.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did it right?

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then wherever

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yep.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So there is-- is there a step
that involves your husband?

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%

>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:18.045 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's the presence in the

00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:90%
It could be someone--

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.010 align:middle line:90%

>>TAYLOR: --you haven't met yet.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be romantic love.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.450 align:middle line:90%
It can be supported as well.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.717 align:middle line:84%
No, my husband really
helps me in my business.

00:39:47.543 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: There it is.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's challenging.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, but it's
getting the foundation right.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:84%
They showed me clearly that once
you get the foundation right,

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:90%
it'll be easy to--

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And I'm seeing
later, adding other levels.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a great idea, and now it
needs a whole new foundation.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's the other
one that's coming up.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK, so--

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lots of hearts--

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You have
a lot of hearts.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --on these readings.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: This is a
woman with the heart.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You're
pulling a lot of people.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.157 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you
were talking about,

00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:24.050 align:middle line:84%
about gathering
people to support you.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman with
the heart, which means--

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:84%
again, it doesn't
have to be romantic.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It can be supportive--
a tender-hearted person

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.830 align:middle line:84%
who has a heart resonance
with your heart.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I ask about this,
there are a few people

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:90%
like this in your life already.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's another one
coming down the road

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't met yet.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so keep in mind we
got this, that someone

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to resonate
with your heart,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to be
supportive in some way.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It might be about
a family issue,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:84%
it might be relating to
something going on at home,

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or it might be about
a business issue.

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
But there is
somebody yet that is

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:84%
going to come in and be
supportive for something.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, that's fantastic.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's actually a big deal
for me is looking for support

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and accepting support.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is for many people is
really to accept support--

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It is.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --especially as
a strong female and you

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.240 align:middle line:84%
have been kind of
conditioned that you

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
have to do it all on
your own because you

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:84%
have these ideas of
perfection that can only

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.965 align:middle line:90%
be accomplished by you.

00:41:30.965 --> 00:41:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know,
it's my whole story.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.047 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, and
it's very important.

00:41:34.047 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people feel that
they have to be the ones,

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of women
are caretakers,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and so they put themselves
on the back burner

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and put everything else first.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then
they don't know

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:90%
how to achieve their goals.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:90%
They have these goals.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:90%
They want to do this.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They want to be a
reader, a healer,

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and yet they've been
putting everyone else first.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to do two--
when you have a goal,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to do two
things, very important--

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
self-prioritize, self-care,
radical self-care,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:90%
self-prioritize.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And also, look at your intention
behind what you want to do.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Let go of any
desperation about it

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.870 align:middle line:84%
because your
desperation can cause

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you to stay in old patterns
of putting someone else first.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:84%
If I'm desperate to become
a millionaire seller

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
in my company, that
desperation triggers the law

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of paradoxical intent, which
says the more desperate

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:84%
you are to achieve something,
the more that desperation

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:90%
pushes it away.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
don't know about that.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So in their
head they get desperate,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:90%
and on the other side--

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In survival
about it, right?

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, and on the
other side of the coin

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:90%
they're also caretakers.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two big
blocks that I see to people

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:90%
achieving their goals.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So whichever one
you have, or both,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:02.260 align:middle line:84%
make sure you edit that and make
some honoring choices and just

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:84%
trust in your process
and be happy now.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Your happiness now
will attract the event

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that you think will
make you happy later.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That paradoxical--
so we want something,

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:90%
but yet we push it away.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.067 align:middle line:84%
We want something, and we push
it away with our resistance

00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:84%
or survival or
whatever it is you're--

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Whatever it is--
desperation or even fear.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Desperation and fear.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:90%
This is very common, I believe.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Very
common, very common.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the big obstacles.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the two big are
self-denial and desperation.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, in just a
minute, Sandra's going

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.877 align:middle line:84%
to do a wonderful
visualization that's

00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.585 align:middle line:84%
going to take us into
our Akashic record.

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So stay tuned for that.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So first I want to ask
you, with the cards

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the decks that you do,
which is your favorite?

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the one you would
recommend us starting with?

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I
like the Energy Oracle

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:90%
cards are a good start.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But the Akashic Tarot,
which I thought we had here,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.150 align:middle line:90%
is very much like the tarot.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you're familiar
with the-- a lot of people

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
who've been readers are
familiar with the Rider-Waite.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:09.555 align:middle line:84%
That really hits-- it
opens up karmic stuff and--

00:44:09.555 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that
one the original?

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So it's what
you're looking for.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Rider-Waite?

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: The Rider-Waite
goes back 200, 300 years.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
like me, who are 100 old--

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, pretty much.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: --used to
work with just that.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So the deck that I did with my
sister, Sharon Anne Klingler,

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.410 align:middle line:90%
is called the Akashic Tarot.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And that has a lot more
specific guidance relating

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to karmic stuff and
the Akashic records

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and how to open those records.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.230 align:middle line:84%
This is more about energy,
the energy in your life

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and how to shift
your energy and what

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.720 align:middle line:84%
the future may bring
because of that energy--

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:90%
so whatever calls to you.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.165 align:middle line:84%
When I pick a deck, I put
it to my heart center.

00:44:57.165 --> 00:44:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, so that's
the way you choose it.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Have you had people
completely and significantly

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.018 align:middle line:84%
changed their lives
from picking a card?

00:45:06.018 --> 00:45:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely,
many, many, many people.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.013 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anything that
you can bring to mind?

00:45:14.013 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I mentioned
the one about the patience.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:84%
There was-- and this
was relatively recent.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.160 align:middle line:84%
He was passed over and
passed over and passed over

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.820 align:middle line:84%
for promotion, and he
wrote a resignation letter,

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to
turn it on a Monday.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the people
that pulled a card every day.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:36.870 align:middle line:84%
He pulled the patience card, and
he was like, eh, but he waited.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And the following
Friday, his boss retired,

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't know
that was happening.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And two weeks later--

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.890 align:middle line:84%
he kept staying-- they asked him
to take his boss's position--

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:90%
so very big promotion and money.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And I've had other people that--

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.480 align:middle line:90%
card reading can really--

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.210 align:middle line:90%
if you understand the guidance.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not just predictive.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.900 align:middle line:84%
There's guidance to it in
both decks, the Akashic Tarot

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and the energy Oracle
Cards, guidance that says,

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're noticing
this about yourself,

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.280 align:middle line:90%
you can change that.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, here's the
card that comes up next,

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:18.945 align:middle line:90%
and that's a great success.

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have all sorts
of people that come to you.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.502 align:middle line:84%
You have businessmen

00:46:23.502 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
over the phone,

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:90%
so you can really intuit.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, I do 99% of
my business over the phone all

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:90%
over the world, for all over.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.952 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I get in
touch with people

00:46:35.952 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
through a heart-to-heart
connection

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and I listen to the
resonance of their voice.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do you connect
with them all over the world?

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it different
for different countries?

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.253 align:middle line:90%
Is really, truly the mission--

00:46:47.253 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's all the same.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --of people the same?

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: They just call and--

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we set it up, and
they call, and then

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I just get into their energy.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But between each client, I
have to do a clearing process

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to bring
energy from the previous client

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.590 align:middle line:90%
into the next.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what
I'm asking is, is

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.310 align:middle line:84%
the mission and the
purpose of people

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
really, truly, across
the globe the same?

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it that we all really
want the same things?

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: People want some
prediction about love and money

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.540 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Some security.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
most of the people

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I work with want a
deeper understanding.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I ask for that because
once you get, oh, this is--

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll get a past life, and,
oh, it makes so much sense,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
then I can rewrite this, and
then change this pattern.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
People are looking for a
deeper understanding that

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.560 align:middle line:84%
does take them to the results
that they want, but it's not

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.370 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:84%
some people, some readers I
know, say, oh, they just call,

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.477 align:middle line:84%
and when am I going
to meet the guy?

00:47:53.477 --> 00:47:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You gotta do the action.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do the action.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You've
gotta do the action.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But most people, even
if that's a question,

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:84%
they want to
understand the energy

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:90%
behind it, which is great.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I've always said that the bridge
between hope and possibility

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:90%
is action.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Hope is just dreaming
about a possibility.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it really coming in?

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to do the
action to get you there,

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.038 align:middle line:90%
and this is part of the action--

00:48:18.038 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, it can be.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --which is really cool.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.525 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:48:20.525 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Action is an energetic
momentum that tells

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.125 align:middle line:90%
the universe you're serious.

00:48:24.125 --> 00:48:24.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:48:24.925 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like writing the order
where you actually-- it doesn't

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.950 align:middle line:90%
have to be the right action.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
thing I wanted to ask

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.600 align:middle line:90%
you is about perfectionism.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:84%
We do set these goals and
these ideas where we really

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
are locked onto,
especially those

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with creative
imaginations, of what it

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we want
to create, what we

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.162 align:middle line:84%
want it to look like, the
feeling we want to get from it.

00:48:44.162 --> 00:48:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, you
can go into the future

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and you could pull
that image back.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, what if it shatters?

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:90%
What if it isn't that?

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: If it isn't
that, then you change.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That perfectionism.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Like, one of
the people that I taught,

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I taught how to go
into the future,

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.510 align:middle line:84%
she was working on
a job promotion,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:90%
and she was a lawyer.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And she asked, am I going
to get this promotion?

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And the vision she
saw was that she

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.190 align:middle line:84%
was in a conference room
sitting across the table

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:14.130 align:middle line:84%
with her husband
talking about divorce.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, ever since
you've got this promotion,

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.720 align:middle line:90%
you haven't been around.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You aren't with the kids.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.750 align:middle line:90%
You aren't with me.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And so she got the answer.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:90%
She got the promotion.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But then she came back from
that and said, what do I really

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:90%
want here?

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Is that more money
and more prestige

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:90%
worth losing my family?

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And so she shifted her
energy, and she became satis--

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:90%
she made plenty of money.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.580 align:middle line:84%
She became satisfied and really
started focusing on the value

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.720 align:middle line:84%
her family brought to her life,
and it was such a blessing

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
to see how it was going
to go if she had actually

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.640 align:middle line:90%
gotten what she wanted.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If we have
to choose that--

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.380 align:middle line:84%
this is a whole other show
topic here on women choosing

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:84%
between family and
work, but I really

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
think that there's got
to be a way to do both.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: There is
a way to do both.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:90%
She stayed in her job.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.650 align:middle line:84%
She actually went to
her boss and said,

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is there less travel if
I take the promotion?

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.670 align:middle line:90%
And the boss said, no.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And the boss actually
said, you can

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.615 align:middle line:84%
keep the hours you're working
now, and she was doing fine.

00:50:16.615 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow, she found all of that--

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And so she was very--

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:19.500 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --through card
reading, which is really great.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going
to do this, and we're

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.820 align:middle line:90%
going to have you guide us.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: OK.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are we
going to do here?

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.950 align:middle line:90%
We're going to--

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, we can go
into our hall of records

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and look for some
guidance or purpose.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We'll look at the
book of guidance and purpose.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just going to
count down from three to one.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the count
of one, you'll be

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.270 align:middle line:84%
able to either see
or sense or just know

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:43.525 align:middle line:90%
you're at the hall of records.

00:50:43.525 --> 00:50:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wonderful.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.442 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then we're
going to walk in and see

00:50:46.442 --> 00:50:49.350 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, big
book on a table,

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to let it open up,

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see some
either words or an image

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.180 align:middle line:84%
floating over it to tell
you about your guidance

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:90%
or your purpose.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're looking
for guidance and purpose.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:90%
This is the intention here.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people need to
know about purpose,

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and some people just
want a word of guidance.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so this is what
we get to do is we get to--

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:09.870 align:middle line:90%
play along with us, really.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.250 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're here for.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So play along
and really look at this

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:18.280 align:middle line:84%
through the master that has been
teaching this for 30 years now,

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.080 align:middle line:90%
yes?

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, but look at
it through your own master.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's higher
self is the master

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.080 align:middle line:90%
of what they're going to see.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And there might be spirit that
they see in the hall of records

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So-- OK, everyone
just take a deep breath

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and close your eyes.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And take another deep breath
and just let your shoulders drop

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and let your forehead relax
and relax all the muscles

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:46.290 align:middle line:84%
in your body as I count
backwards from three to one.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And with each descending
number, you're

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.490 align:middle line:84%
going to feel yourself
going deeper and deeper

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And at the count
of one, you will

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:90%
be at your hall of records.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.780 align:middle line:84%
You'll either see or
sense or feel or just

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
know that you are at
your hall of records.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So just let yourself relax now
with each descending number.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Just let all of the
muscles in your legs relax.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Let all the tension drain
away, draining from your legs

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:25.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way down out
your feet and toes.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing even further now, let
your shoulders and arms relax,

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a warm wave
of relaxation moving down

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.280 align:middle line:84%
from your head, through
your back and arms, all

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.320 align:middle line:90%
the way to your feet and toes.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And one.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Just allow yourself to
remain calm and relaxed now

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to sense or
see or feel the mists clear,

00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you are
at your hall of records,

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.580 align:middle line:84%
your Akashic records,
the records about you

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and your eternal life.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So let yourself just go into
this beautiful building now.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, you start
to notice many books

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.980 align:middle line:90%
on shelves around you.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And you notice in the
center of the room

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful, big
book on a table.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.670 align:middle line:10%
Just let yourself go
to that book and sense

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:39.130 align:middle line:10%
or feel or see that
book before you.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:44.140 align:middle line:84%
This book is your book
of purpose and guidance.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And it can answer any question
you have about guidance

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:52.750 align:middle line:84%
for your next best
step or guidance

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:58.570 align:middle line:84%
about your purpose in the
world and in your own life.

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Think now about what
kind of information

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.290 align:middle line:90%
you would like to receive.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, you see
the book start to open,

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.250 align:middle line:90%
and the pages are flipping.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful light
is coming from it.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you think
about your intention,

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:25.600 align:middle line:84%
you see the book
settle on one page.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And this page offers
a message for you.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It may come in the form of
a word, a phrase, an image,

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:37.530 align:middle line:90%
or just a feeling.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Just let yourself be open to
receiving that message now.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:84%
However this message
comes, even if it's just

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.220 align:middle line:84%
a fleeting thought or a
sensation in your body,

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:10.140 align:middle line:84%
you know you will receive more
and more information over time.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you start to
see or sense or feel or know

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
the book to be opening
again, and the pages

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are flipping with a beautiful
light all around them.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
give you another message,

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:30.650 align:middle line:84%
either relating to the first or
something entirely different,

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:34.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe a message for
your personal life.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And as it settles
on that page now,

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:42.090 align:middle line:84%
be open to receiving this
message in whatever form.

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You may see an image over the
book or words or a sentence

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:90%
or hear or sense or just know.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself receive
this message now.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:56:09.080 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Just let yourself be open
to whatever you receive.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And know that the records
are open to you now

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can receive
guidance in any way

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that you desire, in dreams,
even in a flash of a thought

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:35.170 align:middle line:84%
as you're going
through your day.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Your records are
open to you, bringing

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.920 align:middle line:90%
you guidance all of the time.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Embrace that knowledge
as I now count upwards

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.590 align:middle line:90%
from one to three.

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the count
of three, you'll

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:55.670 align:middle line:84%
be back at this time and space,
back with a sense of having

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:59.010 align:middle line:90%
received some guidance.

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what you
did or did not receive,

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.610 align:middle line:84%
you have made an
important connection here

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:08.690 align:middle line:84%
with your own records,
opening the door

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:84%
to receiving wonderful
wisdom and inspiration

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.140 align:middle line:90%
throughout your life.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.610 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Coming back slowly now.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.800 align:middle line:84%
In the days, weeks,
and months to come,

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:29.140 align:middle line:84%
you will find yourself receiving
more record information.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Just let yourself be open
to the guidance it brings.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to this
time and space.

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.730 align:middle line:84%
In the days, weeks,
and months to come,

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:45.970 align:middle line:84%
you will feel your
intuition growing

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and you will sense a knowledge
blossoming within you,

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.690 align:middle line:84%
making you aware of
the beautiful options

00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and the strength that
you have to follow them.

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:01.570 align:middle line:90%
And three.

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Back to this time and
space now, knowing that

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.920 align:middle line:84%
can connect with your
records and the spirit that

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:14.650 align:middle line:84%
brings you information
any time that you desire.

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So just stretch out
and open your arms.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:19.680 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.780 align:middle line:84%
What I love about that is
that you can watch that

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:22.613 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:58:22.613 --> 00:58:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You can
do it any time.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.568 align:middle line:90%
It only takes a few moments.

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can
get different things

00:58:27.235 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:90%
the more you do it.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Different images will come
in, and different support

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:33.405 align:middle line:90%
will come in.

00:58:33.405 --> 00:58:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I got this really
beautiful image of rain,

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and it was rain coming down,
and there was an umbrella,

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.640 align:middle line:84%
but there was a
lot of rain, and it

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.230 align:middle line:90%
looked like lightning and rain.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, to me,
the way I interpret

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that is that it's
a cleansing rain.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.880 align:middle line:84%
There's something that is being
cleansed out of your life.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The umbrella is protecting you
from any emotional upheaval

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.100 align:middle line:90%
from the cleansing.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's something that
is being kind of swept away,

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and it may be about
a personal thing

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.130 align:middle line:90%
or it may be about a work thing.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But as I go forward in
time on your timeline,

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I see a beautiful
rainbow as a result.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.927 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:59:10.927 --> 00:59:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, it's
cleansing time for you.

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, that is very true.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And someone
with you-- and I

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.555 align:middle line:84%
just heard, and
someone with you.

00:59:16.555 --> 00:59:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, we got this.

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.650 align:middle line:90%
We got this.

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And now, when you
go through that,

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.140 align:middle line:10%
you can also do a reading
afterwards on yourself?

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you do--

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.462 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You can ask-- you
can pull a card.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Like, I would use the--

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.400 align:middle line:84%
after doing this, I would
use the Akashic Tarot deck

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.260 align:middle line:84%
because that is really
connected to the records.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can pull a card and
read the Akashic force and read

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:46.710 align:middle line:84%
the message, and it oftentimes--
and people have told me this--

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:49.840 align:middle line:84%
it can be about the very
thing that you received.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
valid very validating.

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Can you do this also
for a loved one,

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.450 align:middle line:90%
like for a child or a loved one?

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: You can.

00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It's easier if the child is
old enough to understand.

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I have a friend who,
with her daughter since she

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
was, like, eight years old,
pulled an Energy Oracle

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.810 align:middle line:84%
card every day and just
said, what are we going

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.018 align:middle line:90%
to see that happens today?

01:00:14.018 --> 01:00:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fantastic.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.518 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So you
can start younger,

01:00:16.518 --> 01:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
but as the child
gets older, they

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:21.700 align:middle line:84%
can bring more
consciousness to it.

the biggest reason that you

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.320 align:middle line:90%
do what you do, Sandra?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%

As a psychologist in
a private practice,

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I dealt with so many people
who were abused or neglected

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
or just dismissed and,
therefore, didn't define

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
themselves as anything but
unworthy, not good enough, not

01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.190 align:middle line:90%
deserving.

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And it brings tears
to my eyes even now.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.060 align:middle line:84%
It breaks my heart to
sit across from someone

that your soul
pre-existed this and has

picture conversation here--

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
more than card reading, which

>>TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's actually--

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.020 align:middle line:10%
that's a good way to put it.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.030 align:middle line:10%
That's my intention.
