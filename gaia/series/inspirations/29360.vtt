00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.620 align:middle line:10%
There have been
sages with visions

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:10%
of ecological
apocalypse for hundreds,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
if not thousands of years.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:10%
With those visions,
often comes a message

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
calling for increased
responsibility

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:10%
in caring for our Earth.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
A street brawler and
all-around roughneck,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:10%
David Milarch was an unlikely
recipient for such a message.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Yet, it came.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
His story is one that leaves
us with a very clear directive

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
regarding the planet's
ancient trees--

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
trees for which many of us
feel a mystical connection.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times"
journalist, Jim Robbins,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
learned of David's
story and made

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
the decision to chronicle
it in his book "The Man

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Who Planted Trees."

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's here with us today.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.501 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how happy
I am to have you here.

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject near and
dear not just to my heart

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but to everybody in
the booth behind here

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and almost everyone's heart.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
There is something
about trees that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
does have a nature to it
that pulls us into it, again,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
almost on a mystical level.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we don't
understand why just yet,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and you have done a
lot of the leg work

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to really document the
science of why that is

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and what these trees
are doing for us.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to
the science, let's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
talk about this incredible story
of Dave, the story of Dave.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.915 align:middle line:10%
Well, I wrote a story in
2001 in "The New York Times"

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:10%
on something called The
Champion Tree Project,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:10%
which Dave Malarch ran.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:10%
He's a shade tree farmer
from Northern Michigan.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:10%
He grew up on a shade
tree farm there.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
He started something
called The Champion Tree

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Project, which I thought
was a great science

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
story for "The Times."

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I did a piece,
and it got nice play

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
with five or six
pictures of great trees,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was on the cover of
the "Science Times" section,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and it led to more
press for their project,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%
The Champion Tree Project.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It led to "The Today Show"
and "Good Morning America,"

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and so it really put him on
the map, and he was happy.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
He said, I want to plant a tree.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to come to Helena,
Montana where you live

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and plant a tree on the capitol
grounds, and I said, great.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So he showed up and came
to the door of my office

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
in downtown Helena, and he
said, I'm David Milarch,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.369 align:middle line:84%
and he stuck out
his hand, a big guy.

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.202 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Did he bear
wrestle you to the ground?

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of like a bear, a big
guy, and he is a chain smoker.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So we stopped and had a couple
of cigarettes on the way

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
to the restaurant for lunch.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
we'll talk about trees,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and we went into the
restaurant and sat down,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and he said, why did
you bring me here?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking around
this restaurant that's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
a historic building in downtown
Helena, an old mining town,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I said,
what do you mean?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, there's
spirits everywhere.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's a ghost over
there, a guy with a stick pin.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to tell me
where there's gold hidden,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going, wow,
what's going on here?

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns to me,
and he says, you're lucky.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're going to meet
your higher self tonight.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who--

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You didn't
expect this conversation

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.049 align:middle line:84%
to go this way, I take it.
-Not at all.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought we were going to talk
about the science of trees.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that David had
a near-death experience years

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
before and had stopped
drinking, and it sent his body

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
into shock, and he
was in the hospital,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.187 align:middle line:84%
came home, went into his
bad and then died, he said.

00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: What
was interesting is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that little part
you just brushed

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
through is he had
to make a decision.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
His life was so out of control
from what your book says,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that he had actually
embarrassed his family.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
He was embarrassing
his kids all the time,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and he made a decision
I'm putting my vodka

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.164 align:middle line:90%
bottle outside the door.

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: That's right.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming
out dead or sober.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:90%
He almost ended up dead.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.716 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: That's right.

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:90%
He's old school.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.466 align:middle line:90%
He was going to tough it out.

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He was going to look the
devil in the eye, he said.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to put the
vodka and the six pack

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
outside the door,
and he was going

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to-- he knew it was there,
and he wasn't going to go

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.977 align:middle line:90%
through life running from it.

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And he would do the same thing.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
He would go down
to the bar after he

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
quit drinking every
day, have a pop,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.361 align:middle line:84%
and just because he wasn't
going to spend his life--

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
When you say a pop,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.924 align:middle line:84%
you mean he was having soda.
I

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Soda pop, right.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Not a pop of something.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But going into the
bar because he--

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.037 align:middle line:84%
again, to look the devil
in the eye and to say,

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to beat me.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:90%
So this man had courage.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So this wasn't
exactly an accident

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
that this came his way.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what happened after that.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%
After?

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Well, then he died.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Then he died, and he came back.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.643 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: He
actually did die.

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And said that-- and then
later he was visited by he said

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%
was an angel.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
He said he woke up one
day, and his bedroom

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
was filled with light
almost like there were

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:90%
headlights aimed into the room.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I love this
part of the story the way

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that day came down.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Just to clarify it, he died
of essentially cirrhosis

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of the liver and
toxicities of some kind

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:90%
related to alcoholism.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Right, his chest cavity
was filling up with fluids.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Fluids, right.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Fluid was pressing
on his heart,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.296 align:middle line:90%
and his hear was stopping.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah, and so
he died, and in this scenario,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
he went to the place that
most people who report--

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: The imaginal realm.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The place that most people that
report near-death experiences

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
go to-- went through the light,
went to this beautiful place

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.326 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Tunnel of light.

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.413 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: He said
the tunnel of light

00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:28.193 align:middle line:84%
had a blue and pink
helix like DNA in it

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
as he went through the tunnel
and came to spirit beings,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
light beings, angels, and they
told him it wasn't his time,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and he had to go back.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell them at
the time about the trees,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but then it was months later
when he woke up in his bedroom

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the night, and they

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
told him to get a pad
of paper and a pen

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and go out to this
chair in the living room

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and to write down some things,
and he said, next thing he knew

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
it was 6:00 AM, and
he ad an outline of 10

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.531 align:middle line:90%
pages on a yellow legal pad.

00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: But
he had no real memory

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
of anything that occurred
during that time, right?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: No, no memory.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And he showed it to his wife and
his wife said, you can't write,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
you can't spell.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.815 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do this.

00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And there he had the
outlines of a project.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And he told his son,
his oldest son Jared,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and together they started
The Champion Tree Project.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But let's back up
and talk about some

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of what he was
shown, and we don't

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
have to stay linear in time.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
What was he shown the potential
was if he did not do this

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and others did not
participate in recovering

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:90%
the health of the forest?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Was he shown any
future scenarios,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and what it would be like?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was shown, at
least not that I've been told,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:90%
visual things about the future.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But he has been told
that the trees are

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
important that tough
times are coming--

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Earth changes are coming,
severe weather, earthquakes,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And that the trees
have been so fragmented

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and so injured by our
actions that a lot of them

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:90%
need to be moved.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The genetics are so
important in the old trees

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
that they need to be
moved out of one place

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and put in three or four places
to assure that they will carry

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
on and those genetics
will be around as we start

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild after what's coming.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
He said he knows what's going
to happen in the future,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes he's kind of
cagey about what he's been told

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
or shown, but he says that
the outcome is not acceptable,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and he's here to change that.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're here to change that
because you partnered with him,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and whether you like it or not,
you got swept into this vortex

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of Dave's world that you
probably could never have

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
dreamed of before
when you were just

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
doing straight science writing.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: That's right.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing for me is

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that it works on a lot of levels
is that there is good science

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
or a good lack of science
to show that we don't know

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:90%
very much about trees at all.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is
that they are very

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
important and probably much
more important than we know.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start there
at the very basic stuff,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and then we can go all
the way up to the fact

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that trees may be antennas
for divine energy.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
go all the way there

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the conversation,
if you don't mind.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the cloning.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Once he looked at these 10
pages that he had written,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
were written by his hand
but someone else writing

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
through him, what kind of
protocol or prescription

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:90%
was on those papers?

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And then how did he began that?

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
Because I have some
really essential questions

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.056 align:middle line:84%
about cloning versus
taking clippings--

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:36.755 align:middle line:90%
transplants and all.

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word cloning
is a loaded term,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and it isn't necessarily
a loaded term.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And all that means
is that a clone means

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
a replica-- 100% genetic copy.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And so all that means is
taking a snipping from a tree,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
taking a six-inch
cutting, and what they do

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
is they scrape a little
blue bark off of the bottom,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and they root it
in a soil medium.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And those roots start to grow.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what you have is 100%
genetic copy of the tree

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
made through common
horticultural means,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
not through manipulation
of genetics or something

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
roots when they start

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to take on the bottom of some
of these trees, a lot of experts

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:90%
said these trees are too old.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not vigorous
enough to grow roots

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and to start new
trees, and David

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
says, where his angelic helpers
help is forming those new roots

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
because at that
level, they can cause

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
those roots to appear because
they're so small and fine.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: So it's really
susceptible to finer energies.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.
Subtle energies.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that make sense.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
What-- at this
point, I would like

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to know why they chose
to do it that way

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
rather than to gather seeds
and replicate through seeds.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, because a seed is not
100% genetic copy of a tree.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
If you find an acorn
under an oak tree,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that acorn is probably
an offspring of the tree

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
that it's near.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But that tree was pollinated
by other trees that may

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
not have been champion trees.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so David was looking to
find the cream of the crop

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
when it came in genetics, and
that means a champion tree,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
on that had been
scored and recorded

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
in the National Register of
Big Trees as the champion

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:90%
of that species.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And there is a National
Register of Big Trees,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and each tree, the
largest specimen of each,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:90%
is recorded in that book.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
as you said before, there was

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
some scientific debate as
to whether that was wise

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because some of the champions,
of course, were old, even,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
well, we could say past
their prime, prime.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Yet, as you say,
they were getting

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:90%
some kind of other help.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So those genetics transcended
the age of the parents,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and the other thing that
people-- critics have said

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is that, well, these
trees may not be

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:90%
the best tree of their species.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they grew in a place
where the soil was good,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
or it was wetter, or
something like that,

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have anything to go
on because tree genetics aren't

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
well studied, and trees
aren't well-studied,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and so it's a good place
to start, I thought.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And every scientist that I
talked to said, it makes sense.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Protect them.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
They are like people who
have smoked all our lives,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
drank all their lives,
and live to be 95.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't you protect those
in an archive and study them?

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, OK, now,
with that, that was

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of the project.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And so he did start going
about what was prescribed.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to create
various partnerships it sounds

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
like with educational
institutions, universities,

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
banged his head
against the wall.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
not even remotely

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:90%
interested in his project.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So we can guess that this
project of this man, who

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
was being viewed as a visionary,
or crackpot, whichever way,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little bit of both, had
some hard going to get going.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about how it ended up.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the story really
goes in a beautiful place.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But before that, let's get
into some of the actual nature

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:90%
of trees themselves.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:84%
As a tree lover, I love
the part of your book

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
where you talk about
the aerosol effects

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
from trees, which most of
us have never considered.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And like many things
in the tree world,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:90%
it's not well-studied.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:84%
There are some studies that
show that these aerosols

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that trees emit are very
important to the world,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:90%
but there aren't many.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind
of amazing to me

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that science is not seen fit to
study this perhaps because it

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make money or
it's not on the A list

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of things that are
being studied--

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:90%
genetics and things like that.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that a lot
of the aerosol that comes

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
from trees, the chemicals that
come from trees in the form

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
of very fine particulates,
especially when it's

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
warm-- the warmer it gets,
the more aerosolizing

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
a tree does-- a lot of
them are very powerful

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
anti-fungals, antibiotics,
chemo-preventatives, limonene

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
is a chemopreventative.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the big things
that comes out of trees.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Perillyl is a chemopreventative.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Methyl jasmonate is a
chemopreventative in cancer

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
treatment, anti-cancer
compound, as is limonene.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these chemicals
that have not been well-studied

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
being aerosolized,
and there's probably

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
dozens of these different
trees, pinene from pine trees.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
what role they play.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not saying that
science has said these things

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
prevent cancer if we
walk in the forest

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
or if we live around
trees, but that's certainly

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.685 align:middle line:84%
a question that's raised, and
I would like to see it studied,

00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why
it has been studied.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the reasons
I wrote this in the book

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
was that people will
take this seriously.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the compounds
I think is really important

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
is acetylsalicylic acid,
which is of course,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%
where aspirin came from.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, the willow tree.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's 300 to
400 species of willows

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Northern Hemisphere
around the world

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:90%
that line waterways.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the chemical
that created aspirin.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And aspirin, by the way,
is not just for headaches.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Aspirin has been shown in
very good studies, published

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.585 align:middle line:84%
studies, many different studies,
to be an anti-cancer compound.

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It prevents prostate.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It prevents bladder cancer.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.007 align:middle line:90%
I mean, on and on--

00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That's
not commonly known.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: That's
not commonly known.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Why
would that not be--

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.883 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: It's been reported
in "The New York Times"

00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:35.817 align:middle line:90%
and many other publications.

00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:36.983 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
So now, would this

00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:90%
be true of the willow bark?

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you can go to
a health food store

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and get the willow
bark, which is I

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
guess, a closer derivative
from the original substance.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: No, I think this I
think what people have studied

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is they've studied aspirin.
REGINA MEREDITH: Aspirin.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.229 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
As a chemo preventative--
as a cancer preventative,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and aspirin has been
shown to be something

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.254 align:middle line:84%
of a miracle drug in terms
of its prevention of cancer.

00:14:58.254 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I was surprised
to read that in your book.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard that.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Yeah,
and so-- so what's

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:84%
happening when willows line
waterways and they take up

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
water through their
system, they're essentially

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
washing the water with
this chemical compound

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and then aerosolizing
it into the atmosphere.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So our willows is kind of not
only disinfecting this water,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
but also creating a
medicine of sorts for us

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
if we drink the water,
if the fish swim in it,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
or if animals drink
it-- wildlife drink it.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Does the sun somehow
potentize this compound

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
so that's even more powerful
along the lines of homeopathy?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't
know these things.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I do in the book is
kind of talk to people who

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
believe that is the case,
and hopefully, science

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
will at some point take
it seriously and say,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:90%
this is really important.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and
empirically, if you camp out

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
in the forest, which I love
the redwoods in particular,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine if
you were just to stay

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
there for an extra
few days, you come

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:90%
out with a new lease on life.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for that.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
saying, you're being

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:90%
bathed in all these chemicals.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're also being
bathed in information, which

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:90%
we'll get to in just a moment.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But one of the parts you
wrote about in the book

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:84%
was the Sierra Nevada
where they have

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
been able to
determine the presence

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:90%
of 120 different chemicals.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: However, they
can't even identify-- well,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:90%
they can identify 70 of them.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge percentage that
they cannot even identify.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
themes of the book

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
is the questions that science
doesn't-- science doesn't ask.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of questions when

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
it comes to trees that
science has never even asked.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of them is what
role these chemicals play not

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:84%
only with regard to
anti-cancer in people,

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:84%
but what role it plays--
the chemical ecology

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
plays with wildlife--
bees, for example.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this problem
of colony collapse disorder.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Well,
it might be a virus.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:90%
It might be a parasite.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's the fact that
nature isn't robust enough,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and so the chemicals that these
anti-fungal, antibacterial,

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and anti-cancer
compounds-- the bees

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
aren't getting enough of
them when they go from flower

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to flower or tree to
tree, and they're not

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
able to prevent these diseases.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pollinators, if you
think about bats, if you think

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
about bees, and you think about
birds that spend their time

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
in trees, they're getting
showered with antivirals,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
anti-fungals, anti-bacteria.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps its preventing
all of these things

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
from occurring in these very
important species to us.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
We have white nose virus now
that's broken out in bats.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: What is that?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a virus that's
killing millions of bats

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It's really alarming.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just hit the
West, but it's happened

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:90%
a lot through the East Coast.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, is it because there
aren't enough of these robust

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
compounds out there because
we have suburbs and cities

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and farm fields where we don't
have the right kinds of trees

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
that have these compounds?

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.094 align:middle line:84%
I think there's-- I think
it's a place to look.

00:18:17.094 --> 00:18:18.160 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: I think so too.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back to the health
effects while we're on that.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the study,
the NIPPON study of the 12

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
healthy man in Japan--
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:90%
A little bit about that.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened in that.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Japan, they take,
and in other countries--

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Korea and in other countries--

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.229 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Russia.
-Russia.

00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They take the idea of the health
effects of trees and forests

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:90%
very seriously.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:90%
And they've done studies.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole field of
environmental medicine there

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that looks at this
kind of thing.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
They have studies which they
did pre and post studies, where

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
they would test cortisol levels
in healthy men in the city,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and then they would test NK
cells, which are natural killer

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:84%
cells in the immune system
that kill viruses, and cancer,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're very important
to keeping us healthy,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and then they would measure
those after a couple

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
of days in the city.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
They would measure those after
a couple of days in the forest,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
cortisol, a stress chemical,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
went down after a couple
of days in the forest,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:90%
but went up in the cities.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And NK cells, which are
important to keeping people

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
healthy, a number of NK
cells went up in the forest

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:90%
and down in the cities.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So trees have a role to
play in keeping people

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:90%
healthy-- trees and forests.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, no one knows what the
active ingredient, as it were,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:90%
of these trees are.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It might be these phytoncides,
which are the chemicals that

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
come from trees that
keep us healthy,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
but there might be
other things that work.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
People I've talked to who study
this in the United States--

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
the University of Illinois
at Champaign-Urbana

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is one place that does
quite a bit of this--

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
think it might have something
to do with attention

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that when we're
in the city, there

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:90%
are a lot of man-made objects.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
There's cars.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:90%
There's buildings.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
There's other people, and
we have to pay attention.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to do a
lot of processing

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
in the brain to sort it all out.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to
a forest, we're

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:90%
not focused on any one thing.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We allow our attention
to relax and, of course,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
when your attention is
a very critical part.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a nerve of
the whole system,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:90%
our whole psychological system.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you pay
attention differently,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.764 align:middle line:90%
your whole body responds.

00:20:36.764 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
you tend to breathe.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: You
tend to breathe.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Your muscles relax.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a system-wide
response from a change

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in how we pay attention.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So it might be
something like that.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
E.O. Wilson, the famous
biologist from Harvard,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
coined the term biophilia
that we evolved forests,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and so there might be some
deep, perhaps unknown, effect

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have when
we're in nature,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where we came from.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not so much the case now.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's
just take North America.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We have people watching
from all over the world.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
But let's take North America.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.251 align:middle line:84%
This was a very heavily
forested country at one time.

00:21:16.251 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the decimation in terms

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of what percentage of old
growth existed even up till 100,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
150 years ago and
what exists now

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
so we can get an
idea of what we have

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
been-- what we had deprived
ourselves of as a species.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think 90-- more than
95% of the old growth forest

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
is gone, and again, we
evolved in old growth forest.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And some people-- I read an
interesting book about forests.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And some people think
it was driven by fear

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that as European
settlers came from Europe

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and settled in the US,
they came from a place

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
where there were stories
of witches and werewolves

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and things, and the
first thing they did

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
was clear the land to
make it open and light.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.824 align:middle line:84%
And so deforestation happened
very quickly on the East Coast.

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Well, it reflected

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:90%
what happened in England.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the way of
the world at the time,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and it happened very
fast, and I and I think,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
again, it brings me back to I
think one of my central points

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is those forests and trees
are kind of eco technology.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Those great forests may have
drawn in water with something

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:84%
called the theory
of the abiotic pump

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
may have drawn in
water from the oceans

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.017 align:middle line:84%
and kept the interior of
the climate cool and moist.

00:22:36.017 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
and you speak of that,

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.885 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking of
the coastal redwoods.

00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: The
coastal redwoods.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What were the coastal redwoods?

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there
anyone that has ever

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
witnessed a redwood that hasn't
fall in love with a redwood?

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
These are the most magnificent
creatures on the planet.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, arguably,
the bristlecone pine

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:90%
is magnificent.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It's even older than some of
the eldest of the redwoods.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what happened with them.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
$2.50 an acre-- it's yours, and
those acres were cleared of 97%

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of the old growth redwoods,
which about makes you

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
want to cry to think that
was just in public hands,

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:90%
And what's left is at risk.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things that's
happened in the last 50 years

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
is that the period of time
when the redwood forests are

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by fog has
declined about 30%,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:28.545 align:middle line:90%
and they are fog drinkers.

00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: And they take the
water in through their needles

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:90%
and through the fog banks.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, when you
start to look around and look

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
at the threats to trees and
the way things are changing,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.794 align:middle line:90%
it's daunting.

00:23:41.794 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: It is daunting.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: It's worrisome.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I came to this whole
subject through the fact

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
that I live on 15 acres of
ponderosa pine near Helena,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Montana, and they started
dying in 2004 I think it was,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and four years later,
they were all dead.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And we cut them all down, and
we have some around the house

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that we would save
through spring,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
but they died, and there
was nothing we could do.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.667 align:middle line:84%
And when trees start dying,
they can die very fast,

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing you can do.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yes, entire forest.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
What about the
Rockies-- the Rocky

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, the forests of the
Rocky Mountains right now?

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's happened
in the Rockies

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.575 align:middle line:84%
from the bristlecone pines,
to the lodgepole pines

00:24:22.575 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of Colorado, to the ponderosa
pines of Montana and Idaho,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
what's happened is it's
gotten much warmer.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:84%
The Western United
States is warming

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:90%
faster than anywhere else.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And where I live,
every year would

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
be two to three weeks,
sometimes more, of 30 to 40

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:90%
below zero weather.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.274 align:middle line:84%
Well, this year, we had
no below zero weather.

00:24:46.274 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it takes to
kill pests that kill trees.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: See, that's
a really important part.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
In the Rockies, as you
wrote in your book,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:84%
have the average
winter temperature

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.854 align:middle line:84%
is up about 15 to 20 degrees
over what it was in the past.

00:24:58.854 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: That's right.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The coldest it gets--
the wintertime minimum

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:84%
temperatures-- the
average wintertime minimum

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
temperature-- has gone
up about 20 degrees,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and in the world of climate
science, that's unheard of.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things don't
change that much that fast.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the average
temperature in the West,

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
which is warming faster
than anywhere else,

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:90%
has gone up two degrees.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But the wintertime minimums
have gone up 15 to 20,

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and its startling.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: That
was quite shocking.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
It's startling.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what killed my trees.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what's killing
the bristlecone pines.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The bristlecone pines have
been around for 5,000 years,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and they are dying,
and they will all die.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And they are looking now
for resistant trees in hopes

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
of growing new ones,
but these are trees

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:90%
like Methusela, Prometheus.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
These are trees
that have been named

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.374 align:middle line:90%
and have their own personality.

00:25:51.374 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: In a little
bit, we'll take a break,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
but when we come back,
I want to actually

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about what the story
of Prometheus , for example.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean these trees have
brought up such deep commitment

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and emotions of
the people who've

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
been dedicated to trying to
save them and for good reason.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, imagine a tree
that has been living

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
since the early days of the
pharaohs of Egypt, for example,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
continuously fighting off
elements, fighting off

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.060 align:middle line:84%
every kind of pest that has
come its way, every kind

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
or-- and climate change
has happened before.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not the first
time we go through periods

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
where it's hotter, it's colder.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And something in them has had an
intelligence to be able to make

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:90%
it all the way through.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: But this time
something's different.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
What's happened?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%
What's different now?

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's getting warmer.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's getting warmer faster, and
of course, it's only started.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the next 100 years,
the prediction for warming

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:84%
is unprecedented in
the geological record.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there's
something else going on.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's other
factors at work.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is, we can't
afford to sit around and wait

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and see if trees survive.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think what David
Milarch is doing

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and what many other
people could do

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and are doing who have gotten
interested in this is start

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.165 align:middle line:90%
to help these things survive.

00:27:08.165 --> 00:27:09.065 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely

00:27:09.065 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a project in Norway
that takes seeds from plants

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
from around the world and
put them in a vault. Well,

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
you can't do that
as easily with trees

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
because they have to grow,
but essentially, his project

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent
of that, making

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
sure these things survive
by taking the redwoods

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and planting them all
around the world--

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.937 align:middle line:90%
France, England, whatever.

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I mean,
it's so heartwarming.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that more in just a moment.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
also going to talk about how

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:90%
trees talk to each other.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We are back talking about one
of my very favorite subjects,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
trees, and I would like you
while we're showing the picture

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.945 align:middle line:84%
of Prometheus to tell us a
little bit about the lore

00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and story of what
happened around this tree

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
in terms of activism, and
emotion, and everything.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Well,
Prometheus was a tree.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It was growing back in the
'60s, and a young student who

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
was doing work on
climate ring, tree ring

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
studies, studying
climate, got his coring

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:90%
drill stuck in a tree.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to take
out many years of records

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
to see how the
climate had changed.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:10%
And it was an expensive
drill from Sweden,

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:10%
and it got stuck in the tree,
and he didn't want to lose it.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the
Forest Service if he

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
could cut the tree down to
get the drill out, and he did.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And he took a slice of the
tree and went back to his hotel

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:84%
in a little town of
Baker outside of what is

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:90%
now Great Basin National Park.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And he counted the rings, and
he got up to 4,900 and something

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and stopped and realized
that the tree was

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:90%
probably over 5,000 years old.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Beautiful.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: And probably
the oldest tree in the world.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And he had cut
it down to save a drill bit.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Core drill.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Not knowing, of course.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Not knowing.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: The oldest.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it led-- it
caused a lot of outrage.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
People wrote articles, and a lot
of times these kinds of things

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
are what it takes to get people
mobilized to do something.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And it led to a campaign to
protect the bristlecone pines.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Great Basin National
Park was created.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
I remember that.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Protected
areas in the White Mountains

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:84%
of California-- also
protected Methuselah

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and the old trees there.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
with the sequoias.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Someone cut down a sequoia
tree and took the bark off

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to take to New York to
show as at a sideshow,

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:90%
and people were outraged.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:84%
They killed the tree
and took the bark

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and left the-- it
was called Mother,

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and they left the tree
standing or naked, and it died.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it caused such outrage,
that it led to protection

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:84%
of the sequoias and
state parks there

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and in Sequoia National Park.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes,
it was a beautiful.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:84%
General Sherman is one
of my favorite trees.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:10%
He's the famous one
that anybody will see,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:10%
and you're not allowed
to take any bark off--

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.146 align:middle line:10%
JIM ROBBINS: That's right.

00:30:23.146 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
General Sherman.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happened with him as, well,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'd like about
the yew tree and a couple

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:84%
of other species of tree
just really briefly,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and again, I was
going to ask you

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
earlier how this feeds
back into what it's doing

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:90%
in cooperation with humankind.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Am I recalling correctly
that the yew tree

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%
is the one that has the taxol?

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Yes.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes, OK.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Which has been made
into a cancer drug.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It is used for breast cancer and
several other types of cancer

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:90%
as a treatment.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, OK, I wanted

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to get that one in because we
didn't talk about that, again,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
just giving the healing credits
for their healing effects

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:90%
to the trees.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
We already talked
about the limonene.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to go
into some of the other

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:84%
what you would almost call more
esoteric aspects of the trees.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And that has to
do with the notion

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that trees are communicating
information to each other.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Before I do that,
I want to make one other comment

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.374 align:middle line:90%
about these compounds.

00:31:20.374 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes, please.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a guy in Bozeman,
Montana, who I've interviewed,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
who studies what are
called endophytic fungi,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and these are fungi that grow
with trees, very old trees,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and these fungi are
symbiotic with the tree.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:10%
And they create
compounds that are

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:10%
different than the
compounds the trees create,

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:10%
and they create
antibiotic compounds,

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:10%
and they essentially are
there to help the tree,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and the tree gives them a
place to live essentially.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:10%
And one of these compounds
that he researched,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:10%
and again, these kinds of things
are not well studied in trees.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:10%
There's tens of
thousands of compounds--

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:10%
both the chemical
compounds in the tree

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:10%
and these endophytic fungi
that have properties that

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:10%
are absolutely novel
and can be explored

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:10%
for a whole range of things.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.090 align:middle line:84%
They might be the
next antibiotic

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to treat MRSA, the infection
that is antibiotic resistant.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:90%
There is some belief that it is.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But one of the compounds,
one of the fungi he found,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
can produce diesel
fuel inside the tree.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Really?

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Inside the tree.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: And it can be--
they think it was used to help

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the tree ward off
infection, but he's

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:84%
growing diesel fuel using this
fungus in the lab in Bozeman

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:90%
at MSU.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one of those
things that is absolutely

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:84%
incredible when you
talk about trees,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and no one knows, and our
knowledge is absolutely

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:90%
in its infancy in this regard.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's the kind of thing I
think needs to be pointed out,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and people need to know that
this is a possibility before we

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
cut the forest down, we
need to know what trees can

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.277 align:middle line:90%
do in a whole range of things.

00:32:56.277 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And we don't
stop to think that not only are

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:84%
we going in after
the really valuable

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:90%
stuff in cutting the redwoods.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But the redwoods can't survive
unless they have various pines

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.824 align:middle line:90%
next to them, for example.

00:33:06.824 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these trees
live in community.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.956 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Right, we have
to understand these systems.

00:33:09.956 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah, the
whole notion of the edge effect.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I think you wrote that there is
only about a 10,000 acre patch

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
left of the redwoods,
the coastal redwoods,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:84%
up where Rockefeller--
the Rockefeller Preserve

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is, which Albee
Creek campground--

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a beautiful area.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
they'll actually survive

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:84%
because you have
this edge effect

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.860 align:middle line:84%
where there has to be a buffer
zone and protective mechanisms.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
In large-scale
forests, the interior

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
might be many degrees cooler
than the edges of the forest.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And the edges of the forest
may die off because it's warmer

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
there, and but that's
OK because the interior

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:84%
the forest is cooler,
and it maintains itself,

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.627 align:middle line:84%
but when you have all edge
when essentially there is no--

00:33:55.627 --> 00:33:56.960 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You
have a strip, yeah.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
 --tinterior of the
forest to keep cool, then

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:90%
you can lose the whole forest.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Right, and we're

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
not thinking about the
complexity in nature, even

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
just-- even just from
a root point of view

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:84%
with the redwoods having
a 300-foot tall tree

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:90%
that has maybe what?

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Four to six-foot deep roots,
but they cling to each other

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and are protected
by other species.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.381 align:middle line:84%
And they came in and cut all
those other species down.

00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You have now a
naked patch with no protection.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: And no one knows
how the root systems of trees

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:90%
are related.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's called
the rhizosphere,

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and the rhizosphere
is probably the least

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:90%
known aspect of the tree.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole universe,
much more complicated

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
than the above ground
part of the tree.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:90%
And it plays a huge role.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
interesting things I researched

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
for the book was
something called

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
phytoremediation where
they use trees to clean

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:90%
up dry cleaning solvents.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They use trees to
clean up radionuclides.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:84%
They use trees to clean
up gasoline, diesel,

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:84%
trees can take in the
most toxic of waste,

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and through the
root system, they

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:84%
have something called
a microbial zone

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:90%
right around each root.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It's about as wide
as your finger,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's densely
packed with microbes.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And these microbes take
in these toxic wastes,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and they neutralize it so
the tree can use the water,

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and then they disappear.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.366 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And you're
not talking about just

00:35:24.366 --> 00:35:25.860 align:middle line:84%
chopping a tree down
and making sawdust

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.084 align:middle line:84%
out of it to mop up something.
JIM ROBBINS: No, no.

00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You're
talking about a very

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated mechanism.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: The living
tree is a miracle

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:90%
in technology, eco technology.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Living trees are truly miracles.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Cutting down a tree for wood is
probably the least enlightened

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:90%
use of it.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.515 align:middle line:84%
It probably-- it benefits the
person who cuts the tree down

00:35:44.515 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and processes it,
but the multitude

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of benefits that come from
trees that benefit everyone,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:90%
disappear.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
trading-- it's

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
trading off this
incredible technology

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.657 align:middle line:90%
for a paltry handful of coins.

00:36:02.657 --> 00:36:03.590 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's very sad.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: It is very sad.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.030 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: And tragic.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:90%
It is tragic.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're losing also the
information-- information

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and familial structure
of tree colonies, which

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:90%
is now finally being validated.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I just 30 years ago--
a mystical source

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of information I had
access to explained--

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:90%
was talking to me about forests.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
This just proceeded my doing
a documentary, which started

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.170 align:middle line:84%
about the same time you very--
the very beginning of your work

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
began on the Sierra
Nevada mountain range.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they said I
thought was just fascinating

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
was that it was not well
understood, in fact, not at all

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:84%
understood, that
trees and forests

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:84%
operate in a very similar
fashion to tribes and families.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It takes multi generations
passing this knowledge from one

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to another, and the
information would then

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
be inculcated into the
younger generations,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and they would have the
wisdom and knowledge

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to uptake whatever
needed to be taken up,

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and defend against
this and that,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and to work in companionship
with other species

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.010 align:middle line:90%
in the forest to do that.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you clear cut
a forests, and they say,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, it's all
being remediated.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They said, when you see
those little trees, that's

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
like looking at a bunch of
little orphan children trying

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to raise themselves with
no guidance and no parents.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.956 align:middle line:84%
Now, I bring that up because
I talked with you off camera,

00:37:25.956 --> 00:37:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying there is now
some evidence that's saying

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.061 align:middle line:90%
this is true scientifically.

00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:32.260 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: When
it comes to trees,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.911 align:middle line:84%
the mystics and the poets are
way ahead of the scientists.

00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.
-They know what's going.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Trees talk to them and
tell them what's going on.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that a
researcher in British Columbia

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
has discovered, again, after the
fact, because the mystics were

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:84%
on to this a long time ago,
is that there's a mother tree,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are daughter and
son trees, and trees pass

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.490 align:middle line:84%
nutrients and connect to these
trees throughout the forest.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, her vision
of it-- science is

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:90%
limited by what it can study.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But her research kind
of gets at the idea.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't establish this
more complicated relationship,

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.894 align:middle line:84%
but it gets at the idea that
shows us something is going on.

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Who was he--
I have it written in my notes

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, but I have
so many pages of notes

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.230 align:middle line:90%
it couldn't fit it all on here.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a man who
was writing about this,

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it may have
been a decade ago,

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.760 align:middle line:84%
a scientist from one
of the universities

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
talking trees--

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:90%
how trees talk to each other.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.594 align:middle line:84%
They ran him out of town
on the rails, didn't they?

00:38:34.594 --> 00:38:35.560 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right, they did.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And he went and opened
a bed and breakfast

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.920 align:middle line:84%
after he was ridiculed for
his talking trees theory.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But what goes around comes
around, and what's happened

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is that other scientists
have picked this up.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
realized is that we

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the equipment
to study some of these.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.210 align:middle line:84%
These are hormones
that trees put out.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the signaling
between trees is hormonal.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And one guy in particular
that I interviewed

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:84%
has studied sagebrush,
which is a tree.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a compound
called methyl jasmonate

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that these sagebrush
put out to warn

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
other-- methyl
jasmonate, by the way,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:90%
is an anti-cancer compound.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Is that's
something we have access to?

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can buy it.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Then
what form does it come in.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it just
comes in liquid,

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.914 align:middle line:84%
but although, I'm
not sure about that.

00:39:21.914 --> 00:39:22.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: OK, OK.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But he found that there's
a very complex and subtle

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.987 align:middle line:90%
signaling processes--

00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
In the sagebrush.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.390 align:middle line:84%
 --that takes
place between trees.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.290 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh, I see.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And if a grasshopper
attacks one tree,

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that tree will signal
other trees about the need

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to prepare a chemical
defense for the grasshopper,

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and so it draws this
anti-grasshopper compound

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:84%
into its leaves to protect
against, perhaps a bitter taste

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:90%
or something, to the insects.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing
they know about it.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think, again,
what really struck

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
me was the scientist
said, one, we're

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:84%
just developing some of the
equipment needed to measure

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:84%
this stuff because it
happens, in his quote,

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:90%
it's ridiculously low levels.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really
hard to measure.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is what
science and trees--

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:10.360 align:middle line:84%
the relationship has always
been kind of difficult.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:84%
They haven't asked
the right questions,

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to a
scientist who said,

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe someday we'll
be able to answer questions, not

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:84%
just the questions we
can ask, or not just

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
the questions we can
answer, and scientists

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:90%
have a tendency to do that.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They only ask the questions
they can answer, of course,

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:90%
because that's all they can do.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest question of
all that I've wondered about

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:90%
is do we live in a sacred world?

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Trees seem to indicate we do.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They're very powerful--
very emotional

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to people who have this
emotional relationship

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what more
important question

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:84%
can you ask than are
the trees sacred,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and is the world sacred.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.577 align:middle line:84%
And yet, scientists
can't measure.

00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Not very many.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Cleve Baxter managed to get a
glimpse anyway into that world,

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and maybe this
would be a good time

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
emotions of plants,

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and one would have to extend
that certainly to trees.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, he found that when he
pounded a nail into one tree,

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that there seemed to be some
sort of signal that is sent out

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to other trees that
indicated that they were

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.560 align:middle line:84%
communicating whether
pain or shock or something

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
to other trees.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Distress, yes, mhm.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
science there is not

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.401 align:middle line:84%
as good as some other
science along those lines.

00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Well, we have
Rupert Sheldrake and his ilk.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Ruper Sheldrake-- very
interesting that there is this

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.210 align:middle line:84%
morphogenetic field or
field of intelligence

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:90%
around trees that guide them. .

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the mainstream
things about trees

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and how they communicate
mainstream science things

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.280 align:middle line:84%
is that trees-- when one tree
gains immunity from a disease,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:84%
it passes that immunity
on to other trees

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:90%
of the same species around it.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:90%
There's a term for it.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't think of it.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's well established, and
so there is a lot of indication

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that trees are communicating
with each other

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it's hormonal
through the root

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.661 align:middle line:90%
system or something else.

00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Let's talk about it

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:90%
on an even grander scale.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think you touched on
this just for a second or two

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the hour.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at the
notion of trees as antennas,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
as both receivers and
transmitters, as providing

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:84%
some invaluable
service to all living

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:84%
systems between the
cosmos and the Earth.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.855 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can share
a little bit of that.

00:42:30.855 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Right,
and that's what I would

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:90%
call informed speculation.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we do know that
trees have a charge.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.870 align:middle line:90%
They've measured it.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:84%
There is some
device that someone

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.844 align:middle line:84%
invented that actually captures
the electricity from a tree.

00:42:45.844 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: An
electrical charge, yeah.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.009 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:42:48.009 --> 00:42:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
the use electricity

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to run an early warning system
to warn about fires and just

00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the electricity
that the tree emits

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:90%
is enough to run those systems.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:90%
So trees do have a charge.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:90%
They do have electrical charge.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:90%
That's well known.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the mystics,
the shamans around the world,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
who believe that
trees can receive

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and send divine energies.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We have the Bodhi tree
that Buddha sat under.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Was he receiving?

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Was that his antenna?

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Was he receiving
information from the tree

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or from the cosmos-- from
another star system perhaps?

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
that kind of thing

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:84%
will be settled
well by the mystics.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I learned--

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.600 align:middle line:84%
a published paper in I think
it's called "New Phytology"--

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:84%
is that perhaps the biggest
factor in a tree's growth

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:49.700 align:middle line:90%
isn't moisture.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not light.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's something called
galactic cosmic rays.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
It's one paper that
was done in Scotland

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:90%
by mainstream scientists.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.480 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: How long ago?

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.664 align:middle line:84%
I would say a
year, perhaps two.

00:44:00.664 --> 00:44:02.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
so it's relatively new.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to read that.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Google "galactic
cosmic rays and trees,"

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:06.597 align:middle line:84%
and it'll come up-- one
of the first things.

00:44:06.597 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: OK, all right.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is that
these high-energy particles,

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:84%
which no one really
knows what they are

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:84%
or what they do that come from
the outer reaches of the galaxy

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:90%
affect tree growth.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of their speculation
is that these particles might

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.780 align:middle line:84%
create clouds , more
cloud formation,

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and so it diffuses the light.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to the trees.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that
there's something going

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:90%
on there, and it's a mystery.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, it sounds like
this man, Lawrence

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Edwards, new something.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was keeping track
of these cosmological cycles

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard this.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
absolutely fascinating.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
He was stating that
certain species of trees

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:84%
react a certain way or
behave a certain way

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
under certain astrological
configurations

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.820 align:middle line:84%
when the moon and the sun and
Venus or whatnot are aligned.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Because he was really
detailed in his research.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
He was a teacher at
a school in Scotland.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.446 align:middle line:84%
He was a teacher at
a Steiner school.

00:45:10.446 --> 00:45:11.145 align:middle line:90%
He was a follower.

00:45:11.145 --> 00:45:12.445 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
well there you go.

00:45:12.445 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
He was a follower of Rudolf
Steiner, who of course,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.920 align:middle line:84%
postulated this idea that
there was this energy grid that

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.150 align:middle line:84%
governed everything essentially,
and the trees and the planets

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.330 align:middle line:84%
were connected through this
grid, this invisible grid.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And so Edwards, who wrote
several books about Steiner's

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:84%
work, for years
meticulously recorded

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:84%
the position of the planets
and the positions of the buds

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:90%
on the trees.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he found that
when say Saturn was

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in a certain position, that
the buds of the oak trees

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.760 align:middle line:84%
would flatten out, and then
when Saturn moved on, then

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
they would sharpen.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It was subtle, but
it was unmistakable.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:84%
There were a number of trees,
different species of trees,

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and a number of different
planets that when they aligned,

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
would cause this
change in the tree.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And it went on for 30 years.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:10.610 align:middle line:90%
He studied this.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's still going on.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.700 align:middle line:90%
They are still studying this.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And there's a backyard study.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It was done by one man.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's been carried out by one
man who was a friend of Edwards.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But it shows that,
again, mainstream science

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.570 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to study this.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: No.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's left to someone who
has a passionate interest

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
in it, who studied it, and shows
there is something going on.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:32.360 align:middle line:84%
The only place he did not
find this impact on trees

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:84%
was underneath a power
line that somehow--

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.615 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
That makes sense.

00:46:36.615 --> 00:46:38.030 align:middle line:84%
That would have knocked it out.
-Right.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.150 align:middle line:90%
It blocked.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right,
no subtle frequencies

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.489 align:middle line:90%
would get through.

00:46:39.489 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:84%
It blocked the subtle
energies from reaching the tree

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.261 align:middle line:84%
or from helping the tree connect
to the energy from the planet.

00:46:44.261 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah,
that would make sense.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, speaking of
not-so-subtle energies,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.950 align:middle line:90%
what about the solar effects?

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that we're
going through a period of time

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of increased solar activity.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the
galactic center,

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking at
through the 2012 lens.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Can we look at how all
of that might be playing

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.050 align:middle line:84%
into these systems whether it's
to give new life-- whether it's

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.145 align:middle line:84%
changing time, a shape
shifting time as one of-- You

00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:12.467 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm saying?

00:47:12.467 --> 00:47:13.300 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Not exactly.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.070 align:middle line:84%
How does the sun
figure-- how do

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.010 align:middle line:84%
the solar cycles figures into
all of this as far as you know?

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Or has any study
been done on it?

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've not
heard of any studies.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're entering
into the study

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.800 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to
have more coronal mass

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:90%
ejections and things like that.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, I haven't
heard anything

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that would indicate
that things are going

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:90%
to change because of that.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Logically, they would.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:90%
The soil may change.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.710 align:middle line:84%
We may see more aerosols
and things like that.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.377 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I know,
that's not been studied.

00:47:43.377 --> 00:47:44.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Interesting yeah,

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a different kind of
information they're taking in.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:90%
It's affecting us.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It has to be
affecting the trees.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting our
computers and our brains.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It has to be
affecting this forest.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if there
is any research on that.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just on the mystical
theme element of this just

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:84%
make a comment to there's
a woman I interviewed.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
her probably two

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:10.360 align:middle line:84%
or three times now called
Dr. Manjusha [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And she was an MD who
happened to have a passion

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:84%
for the sciences in
general-- is just

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.550 align:middle line:90%
a natively brilliant woman.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:84%
She was actually
sitting in a tree,

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and now I have to ask
her what kind of tree

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:84%
it was in England
when suddenly, she

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.390 align:middle line:84%
was swept into another
field, so to speak,

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and shown the black hole
theory-- everything.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was all revealed
to her in this tree in what

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.110 align:middle line:84%
probably only took
place in a few minutes

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:84%
but spurned on massive
amounts of research

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:84%
into the black hole
theory, much of what

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Nassim Haramein
works with as well.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
talking, it just

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:84%
flashed on me that was a tree
where it happened with her.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to call
her, write to her,

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and find out what tree it
was, and I'll let you know.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, let's
talk about druids.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the druidic
tradition and our future.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the druids
of Ireland believe

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that trees were mystical and
a connection to the divine.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Their alphabet, the
Ogham, each letter

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.200 align:middle line:84%
was named after a
different species of tree.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:84%
The Brehan law, which
is centuries old

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:90%
was handed down by the druids.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a way of treating
the forest with respect,

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and there were certain penalties
if you chopped down a tree

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.090 align:middle line:90%
or chopped off a branch.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a very interesting
civilization of the forest,

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.950 align:middle line:90%
you could call it.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
British came in in the 1500s

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and had a growing
economy of goods,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and they cut down a
lot of the oak trees

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to make barrels
and barrel staves.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:50.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: There are
poems and songs about this.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Right, and to build
ships and to make money.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and they cut
down the trees as well

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to deprive the rebels
of a hiding place,

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.700 align:middle line:84%
because the Irish
fought fiercely

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.740 align:middle line:90%
to keep the British out.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
have woods, they

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't have a place to hide.

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's akin to the killing
of the bison in North America

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to deprive the Indians
of something to eat.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but in
there, it was trees,

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:19.450 align:middle line:84%
because trees were everything to
the forest culture of Ireland.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
interesting things

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the Sinn Fein,
the rebel-- rebels now,

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the platforms-- one of
their planks in their platform

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is to restore the native--
the forests of Ireland--

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:90%
and the oak forest.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
You've been there.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I've been there,
and there are people

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.950 align:middle line:90%
out there trying to do that.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:84%
They are laboring against
commercial forest growers,

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and most of Ireland has
no native forest-- 99%

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:51.700 align:middle line:90%
percent of it.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:90%
There are a few pockets.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But those forests
that have been planted

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.510 align:middle line:84%
are all exotic species
that are planted to grow

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.605 align:middle line:90%
fast so they can harvest.

00:51:00.605 --> 00:51:01.371 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:02.390 align:middle line:90%
More of a monoculture.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Right, but I did visit one
of the old-- old-growth oak

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.970 align:middle line:84%
forests, and it is
absolutely astounding,

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the feel you get in that place--
the canopy and the trees.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's just--
-Reading about it--

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It's transportive.
REGINA MEREDITH: I can smell it.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it and smell it.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Yes,
you can smell it.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was in Rio recently.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I did a TED talk
there about this.

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I walked through Rio,
and its cacophonous and buses

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and people and buildings,
and I hit this park,

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was with a
couple of people.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I had been talking about trees.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And walking into
this park, it was

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.860 align:middle line:90%
like going from night into day.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- it
was calm and quiet,

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and the trees were everywhere.

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you could breathe all of
a sudden and relax and let go,

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot to show-- a
lot to show that the trees are

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.720 align:middle line:84%
just absolutely
transformative when

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.641 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the human species.

00:51:53.641 --> 00:51:54.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Well, by this time,

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.200 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
preaching to the choir.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine anyone
is not saying, yeah,

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:90%
we need to protect the trees.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back
to David's project.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:84%
He did end up with
an angel donor.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a wonderful
thing happened.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.820 align:middle line:90%
He was a tough, old guy.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But in spite of himself,
he was able to attract

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.180 align:middle line:84%
enough money to really
get this program rolling.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what's
happened over the last 10 years

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:84%
with the program,
and where it is now.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:19.840 align:middle line:90%
We have about five minutes left.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think we'd like to know
what's going on with it-- what

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
varieties of trees
have been cloned,

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.160 align:middle line:84%
where some successful
transplants have taken place.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Bring us up to speed.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, David struggled for
a long time on a shoestring

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to keep the project going, and
finally, he met this woman who

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.700 align:middle line:90%
wrote a check and did it right.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we flew to
Ireland on her private jet

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to collect
the first Irish clones,

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and we went to
California several times

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to collect redwoods.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And they've got between 60
and 70 different species now

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.990 align:middle line:84%
that they've cloned,
and they've just raised

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.390 align:middle line:90%
a lot more money to do this.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.380 align:middle line:90%
So things are going.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:12.225 align:middle line:84%
And they're growing these clones
in California and Michigan,

00:53:12.225 --> 00:53:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting
ready to plant.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to plant
the first redwood-- old growth

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:23.260 align:middle line:84%
redwood forest in Oregon in
December-- early December--

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and try to restore new forests
with old growth genetics.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
David would love to do

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.550 align:middle line:84%
is plant an old growth forest
in Golden Gate Park in San

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Francisco so that these
trees can have their benefits

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to people who live
in the cities, which

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.827 align:middle line:90%
is where most people live.

00:53:41.827 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is not
a forest in the city,

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.930 align:middle line:90%
but a city in the forest.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been
to Mill Valley--

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.096 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah, I used
to live there too, beautiful.

00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a small city
in the forest.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.450 align:middle line:84%
There are redwood
trees everywhere.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I used to
meditate in little fairy

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:90%
ring in the park there.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:58.085 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Right,
it's breathtaking.

00:53:58.085 --> 00:53:58.784 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:53:58.784 --> 00:54:00.930 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Well, why can't all
of our cities and urban areas

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:03.010 align:middle line:84%
be like that or
something like that?

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the thinking
is these trees need to be

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.570 align:middle line:90%
around people to help people.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.545 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the
dreams that he has is

00:54:10.545 --> 00:54:12.040 align:middle line:90%
old-growth genetics in places--

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.240 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
In populated areas.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.610 align:middle line:84%
 --in places where people
live-- suburbs and cities.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:16.115 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: What
about the whole notion

00:54:16.115 --> 00:54:17.415 align:middle line:84%
we talked about in
the beginning, which

00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:20.390 align:middle line:84%
was that these trees
needed to go into areas

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:90%
that they're not indigenous to?

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all along the California
coast and Mill Valley upwards,

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.660 align:middle line:84%
they're indigenous-- redwoods
are indigenous to that region.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But I thought I
had read that there

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.327 align:middle line:84%
has been some successful
planting or attempts in Turkey?

00:54:33.327 --> 00:54:34.660 align:middle line:84%
JIM ROBBINS: Oh, yes,
redwoods have been

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.560 align:middle line:90%
planted all over the world.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.193 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And there
are redwoods in China?

00:54:37.193 --> 00:54:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And the don't-- they
don't cause problems.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:42.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't spread as
an exotic species.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:90%
So they're growing in France.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:90%
They're growing in England.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh,
that's heartwarming.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.499 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:46.499 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say one
thing about planting trees,

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's a lot of bad
news in the world these days.

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But climate change is
probably chief among them.

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think that planting
trees is important.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It's something we can do.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.430 align:middle line:84%
We have this emotional
connection to trees,

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and we can go out, and we
can do something today.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:90%
We could do something tomorrow.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:90%
We can go out and plant a tree.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.390 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hopeful.

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more
important than we know.

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It can help do a whole range
of things, some of which

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I talked about-- some of
which I haven't gotten to.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also is
something that everyone

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:27.140 align:middle line:84%
can do from little
children to old people

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and make a positive-- a positive
statement about the future.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely,
it can even become part

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.260 align:middle line:90%
of your community planning.

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And one city that exemplifies
this is Sacramento, California.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:90%
JIM ROBBINS: Right.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.405 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Every year, I
mean, I stopped counting at 17,

00:55:44.405 --> 00:55:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
number of years ago,

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.260 align:middle line:84%
they would win the
National Arbor Day Award,

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was specifically
because of their tree

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:53.110 align:middle line:84%
planting campaigns that
were very aggressive

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:90%
starting in the 1960s.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They had these just
decimated lands

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that had been
denuded of anything

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and put tract housing in, which
was popular post-World War II,

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and they would require as
you bought-- a homeowner--

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.280 align:middle line:84%
they would require
that you have x number

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.430 align:middle line:90%
of trees in your yards.

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But they would
supply you with them.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
They'd come around to
the homeowner and say,

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.220 align:middle line:84%
you need at least three trees
in this amount of space.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Which varieties would you like?

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And the utility department
actually planted those trees.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We can do some modified
version of that anywhere really

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:90%
through any city or town.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.140 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.740 align:middle line:90%
It's easier than we think.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the poet W.S.
Merwin, who is a poet laureate

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of the United States,
and he called me when

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.840 align:middle line:90%
the book came out, loved it.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It was about 30 copies of it.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But he said on the
last day of the world

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I should want to plant a tree.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that is--
it goes to the heart of this

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:50.890 align:middle line:90%
that trees are hope.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Trees are love in some ways.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.280 align:middle line:10%
Trees are-- trees are our
companions on this planet.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.104 align:middle line:10%
And we need to
take care of them.

00:56:58.104 --> 00:56:59.970 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: They take
care of us, and on that note,

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:01.760 align:middle line:10%
thank you so much, and
there are so many things

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.890 align:middle line:10%
we didn't have time to get to.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But thank you so much
for writing this book

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.661 align:middle line:84%
and coming here and
sharing it today.

00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:08.360 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.860 align:middle line:10%
If you resonate
with the project,

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.390 align:middle line:10%
you can become involved,
searching online

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:15.030 align:middle line:10%
for the Archangel
ancient tree archive,

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.640 align:middle line:10%
you'll be able to find a lot
of information to hook into.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I highly
recommend that you

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.200 align:middle line:84%
pick up a copy of Jim's book--
"The Man Who Planted Trees."

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.510 align:middle line:84%
It seems to carry a
magical kind of pace.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There's something
embedded of its own,

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to inspire you
to increase your relationship

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.820 align:middle line:90%
with the trees around you.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, thank you
so much for joining us here

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.490 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:40.840 align:middle line:90%
