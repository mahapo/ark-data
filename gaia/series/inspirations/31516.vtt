00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi! I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.126 align:middle line:84%
My guest today says that
our bodies are designed

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy, slender,
and energetic

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
and that we're intended to
have smooth, supple skin

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.802 align:middle line:84%
and an alert, quick mind, but
instead, many are overweight

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.804 align:middle line:90%
and tired and sluggish.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.907 align:middle line:84%
Why? Well my guest today
is a microbiologist

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:44.011 align:middle line:84%
and a research scientist, Dr.
Robert Young, and he specializes

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:47.648 align:middle line:84%
in what he calls the new
biology and simply stated,

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:51.218 align:middle line:84%
it is designed to return our
body to its natural state

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.521 align:middle line:90%
of health through alkalinity.

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.455 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:55.523 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh it's wonderful
to be on your show.

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:57.858 align:middle line:90%
Thank your for inviting me.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.093 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great to have you.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.762 align:middle line:84%
You have such pertinent
information and it's simple.

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.365 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very simple,
but tell us a little bit

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:05.866 align:middle line:90%
about the New Biology.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.234 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, very simply the New
Biology is a new way of living,

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.106 align:middle line:84%
a new way of thinking,
a new way of eating.

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:14.208 align:middle line:90%
It's based on two premises.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The first premise is
that our body's naturally

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.447 align:middle line:84%
in its perfect health is
alkaline in its design.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.317 align:middle line:84%
The second point is that all
functions of the human body,

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.186 align:middle line:84%
from the beating of your
heart to the contraction

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:27.888 align:middle line:84%
of your muscle, produce
acidic waste products,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.457 align:middle line:84%
if not properly eliminated
will build

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:34.861 align:middle line:84%
up in the connective tissue and
will cause sickness and disease.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
the two premises.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.633 align:middle line:84%
The best way to understand
this is a metaphor.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor is if the fish
is sick, what would you do?

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.239 align:middle line:84%
Would you treat the fish or
would you change the water?

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Usually change the water.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Right so...

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:48.909 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, the fish
is only as healthy

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.311 align:middle line:90%
as the water it swims in.

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.813 align:middle line:84%
And so today we're
focused in medicine,

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:90%
we're focused on the fish.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.952 align:middle line:84%
Where in reality the fish or
the body cell, the human cell,

00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:00.054 align:middle line:84%
even the blood is
only as healthy

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:01.722 align:middle line:90%
as the water it's swimming in.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:05.826 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that our bodies
are alkaline in its design

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.795 align:middle line:84%
and that our bodies
are 70 to 80%

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:13.033 align:middle line:84%
and when we're born 90% water,
so we're a body of water.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're born, is our
body naturally alkaline?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.573 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we're healthy,
we're naturally alkaline

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:24.411 align:middle line:84%
and the body has systems to help
to maintain that alkalinity.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.179 align:middle line:90%
And...

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Detoxification systems?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Well not just detoxification.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:84%
It has an alkaline
buffering system.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.086 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the major
organ that helps

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.488 align:middle line:84%
to manage the alkaline design
of the fluids of the body,

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:38.959 align:middle line:84%
the delicate pH balance
of 7.365 to 7.4.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.428 align:middle line:84%
Now many of you may
not know that number,

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:44.632 align:middle line:84%
but the pH scale is a scale
that goes from 0 to 14,

00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:45.933 align:middle line:90%
seven being the midpoint.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.069 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're slightly
alkaline at 7.365.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Our ocean waters
are alkaline at 8.4.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.843 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine and what is
happening is the pH is coming

00:02:55.843 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle line:84%
down from acid rain that we're
losing a lot of our marine life.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.317 align:middle line:84%
And so sickness and
disease is increasing

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
because we're not taking care
of our internal environments

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.657 align:middle line:84%
and managing the delicate
pH balance of our bodies

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.759 align:middle line:84%
because of what we're
eating, what we're drinking,

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.661 align:middle line:84%
and how we're dealing
with our emotions.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.864 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a very fine range
that the body is either

00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:20.701 align:middle line:84%
in a state of health or
in a state of sickness.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.604 align:middle line:84%
How would you know if
your body is too acidic?

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Tell us on the beginning
of that range.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.042 align:middle line:90%
I mean, obviously in the --

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.611 align:middle line:84%
the extreme side of that
range you see cancer

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease,
but what's the mild?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.913 align:middle line:90%
That's the extreme one.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first stage of
acidosis or the body holding

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.019 align:middle line:90%
onto its own waste products,

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.455 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
being eliminated properly

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.123 align:middle line:84%
through the four
channels of elimination.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:47.094 align:middle line:84%
That's urination, perspiration
and defecation and respiration.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.663 align:middle line:84%
Our body needs to get rid
of these waste products,

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:53.199 align:middle line:84%
much like a car has to get
rid of its carbon monoxide.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.169 align:middle line:84%
The old potato in
the exhaust pipe.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.037 align:middle line:84%
If the body -- if
the car can't get rid

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.306 align:middle line:84%
of its exhaust, the
engine stops.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:02.176 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens to
us within our own bodies.

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the first stage of
acidosis is we're tired.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:90%
We don't have enough energy.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.351 align:middle line:90%
The second stage is irritation.

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.786 align:middle line:90%
I hurt here, I hurt there.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:15.288 align:middle line:84%
These are allergies
or sinus problems.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.156 align:middle line:90%
Stage three is mucous buildup.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:21.028 align:middle line:84%
The body will secrete alkaline
buffers to initialize acid

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.063 align:middle line:90%
and that's what creates mucus.

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.698 align:middle line:90%
That's stage three acidosis.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.934 align:middle line:90%
Stage four is inflammation.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:31.038 align:middle line:84%
So any inflammatory condition
is a result of retained acid

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't been
properly eliminated.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.408 align:middle line:90%
Stage five is induration.

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:84%
That's the solidification
of acids, like in the case

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.947 align:middle line:84%
of arteriosclerotic plaque
that builds up on the walls

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.349 align:middle line:84%
of the arteries that leads
to heart attack and stroke.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Stage six is ulceration.

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:48.021 align:middle line:84%
And finally, stage
seven is degeneration,

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.291 align:middle line:84%
which is all the conditions,
the chronic conditions

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:55.462 align:middle line:84%
of degeneration from
multiple sclerosis to dementia

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.832 align:middle line:90%
to cancer to diabetes.

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:00.868 align:middle line:84%
Things that are degenerative
in nature.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the seven
stages that I talk about.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.438 align:middle line:90%
>> And they happen --

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.874 align:middle line:84%
what I wrapped my mind around
recently is they happen

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:08.542 align:middle line:90%
in a very small percentage.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.711 align:middle line:90%
It goes from 7.1, then 7.2,

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:14.081 align:middle line:84%
and then 6.9 is the
ulceration stage, right?

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Well -- well when -- we
actually go in a coma at 6.9.

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:18.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So the -- the range
is very, very normal.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.023 align:middle line:84%
The -- the healthy state of
the human body when our --

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:24.158 align:middle line:90%
our pH is balanced --

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:25.392 align:middle line:90%
and we know what happens

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.928 align:middle line:84%
when the pH is not balanced
in the swimming pool.

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:28.495 align:middle line:90%
In fact...

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:30.664 align:middle line:90%
>> ...we look at shampoos.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.934 align:middle line:84%
You probably heard for the first
time pH on a label of a shampoo.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.702 align:middle line:90%
It has to be pH balanced.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.104 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:40.307 align:middle line:84%
When water starts declining in
its pH, this is where bacteria,

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.776 align:middle line:84%
yeast, and molds and
algae start showing up.

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:48.615 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what happens, this
narrow range at 7.365 to 7.4,

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:50.951 align:middle line:84%
as the range either
increases or decreases,

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.754 align:middle line:84%
this is when we feel
out of balance.

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.824 align:middle line:84%
This is when we start feeling
innervated or tired or fatigued.

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:58.125 align:middle line:90%
>> 7.4.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything in excess of 7.4
or anything less than 7.3.

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:07.801 align:middle line:84%
So the range is just point
one-tenth, okay, of one point.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.107 align:middle line:84%
>> If it drops .2 of one point,
you start feeling, you know,

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:17.077 align:middle line:84%
terrible to where if
it continues to drop,

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.413 align:middle line:84%
you're off to the
hospital getting an IV

00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:84%
of sodium bicarbonate
or alkaline salts

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.584 align:middle line:90%
to restore what is -- what is --

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:27.254 align:middle line:84%
medical science refers to
as decompensated acidosis.

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:28.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, my goodness.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:29.823 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So that's --
if you want to see --

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:32.526 align:middle line:84%
now you do a lot of
live blood analysis.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:35.095 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have a
slide here or a video

00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:38.131 align:middle line:84%
that shows a certain
patient that you looked

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
at whose blood is
extremely toxic.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.136 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:47.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Great.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.611 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so we're looking
at live blood.

00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:53.113 align:middle line:84%
These are the red blood
cells, the erythrocytes.

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:55.082 align:middle line:90%
They're fermenting, much

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.184 align:middle line:84%
like a banana would
ferment, getting its spots.

00:06:57.184 --> 00:07:00.153 align:middle line:84%
These red blood cells
have white spots.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.723 align:middle line:84%
These white spots are
indication of fermentation.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:07.961 align:middle line:84%
The cells are breaking down into
sugar and associated very much

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:12.266 align:middle line:84%
with diabetic-type
symptomatologies.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:16.403 align:middle line:84%
Individual folks that
have high blood sugars

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle line:84%
or even low blood sugars
will show these types

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:90%
of cells in blood.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.115 align:middle line:84%
So we see these actual
fermentations taking place

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.449 align:middle line:90%
on the red blood cells,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:34.454 align:middle line:84%
much like when bananas get
their spots, bananas melting.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:39.226 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes mellitus means
to melt into sugar.

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:42.396 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens to cells,
which gives rise to an increase

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:49.303 align:middle line:84%
in blood sugars in the --
or glucose in the plasma.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Here we see a white
blood cell, a neutrophil.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.574 align:middle line:90%
It's moving.

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:54.675 align:middle line:90%
It's [inaudible].

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.209 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
the movement of that.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:84%
White blood cells, particularly
neutrophils, are significant

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.752 align:middle line:84%
because they're the garbage
collectors or the pool sweepers

00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:08.789 align:middle line:90%
of the internal environment.

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:11.325 align:middle line:90%
They provide cleanliness.

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:15.529 align:middle line:84%
So they move through
the blood plasma picking

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
up food particles,
bacterias, yeast to,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.936 align:middle line:90%
excuse me, to purify the blood.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.939 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is biological
transformation?

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.774 align:middle line:84%
You mean in -- on the
slide, right there?

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well on the slide it's --
it's the change of a cell,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.847 align:middle line:84%
much like water when it changes
to a solid, going from --

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.617 align:middle line:84%
from a liquid to
ice or it vaporizes.

00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's a change not in
necessarily the molecules,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.489 align:middle line:84%
but it's a change in its
function and its form.

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:44.258 align:middle line:90%
Basic physics teaches us

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that matter cannot be created
nor can it be destroyed.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.428 align:middle line:84%
It can only change
its form or function.

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:51.164 align:middle line:84%
So we understand
that red blood cells

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:54.768 align:middle line:84%
or even body cells can
change in their form

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:58.639 align:middle line:84%
with this new discovery
that bacteria is coming

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:01.141 align:middle line:84%
out of the cell, rather than
the infection, which is the --

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:90%
the basic germ theory.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:05.078 align:middle line:84%
That germs from the
outside are infecting us.

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:06.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:07.214 align:middle line:84%
>> When in reality
what's happening is

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:09.783 align:middle line:84%
when we compromise the
internal environment

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:11.351 align:middle line:84%
through acidic lifestyles
and diets,

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.853 align:middle line:90%
then we change that environment.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:15.922 align:middle line:84%
Then the cell begins
to -- to morph.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:17.124 align:middle line:90%
Goes through a metamorphis.

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:20.327 align:middle line:84%
It begins to change and it
gives birth to bacteria.

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.063 align:middle line:84%
And that was in 1994,
in a type 1 diabetic,

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.032 align:middle line:84%
the first time I'd
ever witnessed

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:28.969 align:middle line:84%
or videotaped biological
transformation or one cell,

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:32.305 align:middle line:84%
which was a red blood cell,
changing into a bacterial cell.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.242 align:middle line:90%
So you do live blood analysis

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.711 align:middle line:84%
and also dried blood
analysis, right?

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:41.548 align:middle line:84%
>> What we just saw there was
extraction of blood, pinprick,

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:43.583 align:middle line:84%
put onto a slide, looked
at from a microscope,

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.651 align:middle line:90%
and you were videotaping that?

00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:47.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. It's the
live blood unchanged.

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.222 align:middle line:84%
Meaning we're looking
at it as if we were --

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.758 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at it as if we
were looking right into the --

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:84%
the capillary or into
the blood vessel.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.663 align:middle line:84%
We want to see that
unchanged blood and see --

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:58.932 align:middle line:90%
seeing it in its natural state.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.068 align:middle line:84%
And healthy blood is round and
symmetrical, even in color,

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:01.868 align:middle line:90%
even in shape, even in size.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.237 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't the case.

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:08.642 align:middle line:84%
Here we had these blood cells
that were morphing into bacteria

00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:10.944 align:middle line:90%
and later morphing into yeast .

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.313 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we have is we have
a slide of the difference

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:84%
of what looks -- what live blood
looks like in a healthy state.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:17.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:18.919 align:middle line:90%
>> And in an unhealthy state.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
we're looking at here?

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. The -- the picture
on the left, you'll notice

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:26.693 align:middle line:84%
that the cells, both the top
and the bottom picture are even

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.528 align:middle line:84%
in color, even in
shape, even in size.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:31.531 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice the plasma,
which is the environment

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.868 align:middle line:84%
which the cells are residing
in, is clean and pure,

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.704 align:middle line:84%
which is the natural
state of a healthy person.

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.073 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to see
a lot of cellular debris.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:84%
The pictures on the right
actually show solidification

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.713 align:middle line:84%
or acid crystals or
stones, much like --

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:49.216 align:middle line:84%
like breast stones or brain
stones or gallstones...

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Kidney stones.

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:50.417 align:middle line:90%
>> ...or kidney stones.

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:52.119 align:middle line:90%
>> These are blood stones.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.687 align:middle line:84%
These -- this is
the solidification

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.989 align:middle line:84%
of acidic waste products
from metabolism

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.224 align:middle line:90%
that have been solidified.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:01.228 align:middle line:84%
The one on the bottom
right is actually a crystal

00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.863 align:middle line:90%
of someone who is smoking.

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:06.333 align:middle line:84%
So the body will take that
toxin, if it can't get rid

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.768 align:middle line:90%
of it, will solidify it.

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:12.139 align:middle line:84%
So these pictures are
showing one's lifestyle

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:90%
and dietary choices.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:15.509 align:middle line:84%
And so when I look
at these people, I --

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:18.345 align:middle line:84%
their individual blood, I can
tell if they're eating pork

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.147 align:middle line:84%
or beef or chicken or
whether they're eating --

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.481 align:middle line:90%
or if they're a smoker.

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:25.152 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're -- they
have a diet high in sugar.

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.388 align:middle line:84%
The blood expresses
specific forms,

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:31.558 align:middle line:84%
based upon how one is
living and how one's eating.

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:90%
Even how one's thinking too.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.728 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughter] I was just
going to ask you that.

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:36.797 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many different
stressors that the --

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:38.498 align:middle line:90%
that show up in the blood.

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:40.267 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] You can
literally see it in the blood.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:41.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really, really
important to know this

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because we are what we eat
and we are what we think

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is a perfect
example of that.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.915 align:middle line:84%
This -- this next slide is
showing stress in the blood.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.217 align:middle line:84%
So this is along the
lines of what you think.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.285 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this one.

00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:02.055 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is oxidative
stress and this is...

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.027 align:middle line:84%
On the left is -- is how blood
should normally coagulate.

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:09.996 align:middle line:84%
The black lines, there's
a protein called fibrin

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.998 align:middle line:84%
that holds the red
blood cells together.

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.101 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're seeing
thousands of cells in a clot.

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.337 align:middle line:84%
It's what is called
hypercoagulated.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:84%
On the right side, we're
actually seeing hypocoagulation

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.242 align:middle line:90%
or white areas or spaces

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.345 align:middle line:84%
where we have missing red
blood cell conglomerate.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:90%
This is an indication of someone

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.516 align:middle line:84%
who is living a lifestyle
that's highly acidic,

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
that's under stress,
physical or emotional stress.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.857 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the one that's
showing at the top right

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:39.259 align:middle line:84%
where you see a lot
of round areas...

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle line:90%
>> The whitish...

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.361 align:middle line:90%
>> ...the whitish areas, there's

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
like a cluster of
those white areas.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.766 align:middle line:84%
The white areas are
pulmerized proteins.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.135 align:middle line:84%
These proteins are
actually the breakdown

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:52.072 align:middle line:84%
of cells specifically
in the location.

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.241 align:middle line:84%
Here it's in the
core or the gut.

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.443 align:middle line:84%
So this is a pattern
for colon cancer.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:59.713 align:middle line:84%
So the -- the blood,
just like a snowflake,

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
will give us a certain
impression or a pattern,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
which then indicates
specific health conditions

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.155 align:middle line:84%
in direct relationship
to what one's eating,

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.758 align:middle line:84%
what one's drinking,
and what one's thinking.

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:12.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Thinking essentially.

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.896 align:middle line:84%
>> So you could actually
tell the --

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:19.766 align:middle line:84%
a precancerous condition
from the blood?

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.503 align:middle line:84%
We can see a single cancer cell
or we can see a multiplicity

00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
of cancer cells in
those breakdowns.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.942 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually see
the acids that have --

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:31.511 align:middle line:84%
that are expressed, which
are called sialic acid beads

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.614 align:middle line:84%
that show up in -- in the dried
blood, but it's a precursor.

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:90%
It's noninvasive.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.617 align:middle line:84%
It's, in fact, the
only test that I know

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.753 align:middle line:90%
of that will give you a look

00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:43.056 align:middle line:84%
at how your lifestyle is
impacting the most important

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:45.191 align:middle line:84%
organ of the body and
that's the human blood,

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:48.528 align:middle line:84%
so that you can prevent
a cancerous condition.

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:51.464 align:middle line:84%
So you can prevent a
diabetic condition.

00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:54.968 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can see these
conditions quite often before a

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:59.372 align:middle line:84%
heart screening could see
heart disease or -- or --

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:01.775 align:middle line:84%
or even a mammogram could
see breast cancer, right?

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:04.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, for example,
in a mammogram,

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:09.316 align:middle line:84%
you have to have 256,000,000
cancer cells before the cancer

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.551 align:middle line:84%
will actually show
up in the breast.

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:14.621 align:middle line:84%
In this case, when we're
looking at live and dry blood,

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
we can see a -- a
single cancerous cell

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.258 align:middle line:90%
or in a multiplicity

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:23.263 align:middle line:84%
where there's a precancerous
condition, 256 cancer cells.

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:24.597 align:middle line:90%
So we can screen this...

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:25.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, 1% of the cancer.

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:26.766 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:84%
>> ...we can screen
this in order

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.905 align:middle line:84%
to prevent a cancerous
condition, with no radiation,

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:33.773 align:middle line:84%
which I think is
really wonderful.

00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:34.874 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot less invasive.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:35.942 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:38.011 align:middle line:84%
So this next slide
we're looking at is --

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.913 align:middle line:90%
is in a dried blood example.

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:40.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:41.414 align:middle line:90%
>> And so...

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:42.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Another dried
blood of oxidated...

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:43.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Stress.

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> ...stress, where the body is
in a deprived oxygenated state,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.789 align:middle line:84%
where it goes from
respiration to fermentation.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:52.559 align:middle line:84%
More acids are being produced
and these are just the patterns.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.228 align:middle line:84%
The one -- pictures on the
left is how blood should

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.863 align:middle line:90%
normally coagulate.

00:14:56.863 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle line:84%
The pictures on the right
are those pictures associated

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.169 align:middle line:84%
with irritable bowel
syndrome leading

00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:06.072 align:middle line:90%
up to a cancerous condition.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.375 align:middle line:90%
>> So you can see these small --

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:10.977 align:middle line:84%
when you start to see these
types of things in the blood,

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:14.948 align:middle line:84%
then you can -- what level is
this in terms of the range?

00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:18.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Well in the bottom
right picture there

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.887 align:middle line:84%
where you're seeing large
polymerized protein pools,

00:15:20.887 --> 00:15:23.223 align:middle line:90%
these white pasty masses.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.824 align:middle line:84%
That's an inflammatory
condition,

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:26.726 align:middle line:90%
which is precancerous.

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:30.697 align:middle line:84%
And -- and we see this pattern
in precancer, but we see it

00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:33.366 align:middle line:84%
in every cancerous
condition that's related

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to the lower abdominal area, so
the bowels and the pelvic area,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.572 align:middle line:84%
which includes the
reproductive organs.

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:42.509 align:middle line:84%
These patterns show
up every time.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:44.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow! It shows up
in the blood before,

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.613 align:middle line:84%
quite often before the
symptoms occur, before...

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Well if you catch
it early enough.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people that I see
have already been diagnosed

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.619 align:middle line:84%
with an acute or
chronic condition,

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:56.222 align:middle line:84%
but the patterns then show up
validating that their lifestyle

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:59.025 align:middle line:90%
and diet is not conducive to,

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:01.761 align:middle line:84%
enjoying health,
energy, and vitality.

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.197 align:middle line:84%
>> So it would make
it grow essentially.

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.733 align:middle line:84%
So when you -- you can
test your own blood

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.635 align:middle line:84%
with just simple pH
strips that you get

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.969 align:middle line:90%
at the -- at the market right?

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.337 align:middle line:90%
Is that accurate enough?

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:15.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah the pH hydrion
strips, you can tear them off,

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:16.843 align:middle line:90%
test the saliva or urine.

00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:22.115 align:middle line:84%
The saliva tests your ability to
alkalize your lifestyle habits,

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:24.651 align:middle line:84%
your diet, what you're
eating, what you're drinking.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.854 align:middle line:84%
And the urine pH is
a direct indication

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:29.956 align:middle line:90%
of how acidic your tissues are.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.358 align:middle line:84%
It's not a test of the
blood, but a test of...

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:32.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Right [inaudible]...

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> ...the tissues.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:35.762 align:middle line:90%
>> So and I...

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:37.163 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a test of your pH,
not of your blood [laughter].

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.966 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a test -- it's not
a test of your pH of your blood,

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.702 align:middle line:84%
it's a test of the pH of
the interstitial fluids,

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:45.305 align:middle line:84%
which are the fluids that
surround all the body cells.

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Okay.

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>> So -- so if we --
if we see that pH --

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:90%
urine pH below 7.2

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.882 align:middle line:84%
and in traditional medicine what
is a range goes from like 5.5

00:16:55.882 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:84%
on a scale of 0 to 14 up to
7.5, but the range is too wide.

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:05.058 align:middle line:84%
We have a very narrow
range, 7.2 or greater

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.693 align:middle line:90%
for ideal perfect health.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.929 align:middle line:84%
Anything less than that is
a risk factor for, you know,

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.999 align:middle line:90%
acute or chronic illness.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:15.068 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this next slide
that we're going to see,

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:18.471 align:middle line:84%
what would you say this
particular range looks like?

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well this -- this
patient that came

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.110 align:middle line:84%
in had metastatic
or multiple myeloma.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.977 align:middle line:90%
Bone cancer.

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:26.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.414 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was throughout
his entire spine, hips,

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:31.117 align:middle line:84%
but he also had three
tumors in the lung.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:34.888 align:middle line:90%
This is a pattern for cancer.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:39.626 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that, of
course, the encouragement

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:42.962 align:middle line:84%
to make changes in the lifestyle
and the diet and to be able

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:45.832 align:middle line:84%
to document that, because he
had already done PET scans

00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and had been following
this with PET scans

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.037 align:middle line:84%
to see the improvement
using an alkalizing approach

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.439 align:middle line:84%
within 90 days, of
course, he reversed his --

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.975 align:middle line:84%
his multiple myeloma,
which is just amazing.

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:56.709 align:middle line:90%
>> You're kidding?

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:58.311 align:middle line:90%
>> No I'm not.

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:01.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the acid
alkaline balancing system?

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:05.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Using this 15-step
protocol for --

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.687 align:middle line:90%
for his particular condition.

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:10.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. So let's talk
about acid versus alkaline.

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.293 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this and how
it shows up in the blood.

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:16.329 align:middle line:84%
How do you start to
make that transition

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:21.467 align:middle line:84%
from that minor percentage point
from acidity to alkalinity?

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the blood
is going to maintain

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that delicate pH
balance of 7.365 to 7.4

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.276 align:middle line:84%
by compromising other
organs and organ systems.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.745 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
when we're exercising,

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.347 align:middle line:90%
it's not that the acids

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:36.049 align:middle line:84%
from that exercising is
staying in the blood.

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:37.417 align:middle line:90%
It pushes it out of the tissues.

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why we feel pain
when we over exercise,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.222 align:middle line:90%
from an acid that we all know.

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:43.456 align:middle line:90%
It's called lactic acid.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lactic acid.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.091 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.192 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, but if we're
overeating protein,

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.594 align:middle line:84%
there's an acid that
builds up in the body

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:48.962 align:middle line:90%
if it is not properly eliminated

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.997 align:middle line:84%
that causes specific
symptomatology.

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:52.432 align:middle line:90%
It's called gout.

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:54.534 align:middle line:90%
So every disease...

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:56.369 align:middle line:84%
>> ...that has a
name -- every --

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:58.304 align:middle line:84%
every acute and chronic
condition...

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.674 align:middle line:84%
>> ...is a result of some
specific acid, for example,

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
prostate and breast
cancer result

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of too much lactic acid building
up into the body tissues

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.048 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
not eliminating.

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.985 align:middle line:84%
When acids build up, they
break down cells and this is,

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:16.256 align:middle line:84%
of course, the body then
going into a protection mode

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:19.392 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize those acids
and encapsulate the cells

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:21.361 align:middle line:84%
that have been spoiled,
which is the beginning

00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:90%
of the formation of a tumor.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:27.634 align:middle line:84%
>> So the body really needs to
be able to detoxify this acidity

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
if -- if it comes from
too much protein or --

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.774 align:middle line:84%
or over working out, it
normally will start to --

00:19:34.774 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to process it and to excrete
that type of tissue, right?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.014 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if we're not drinking
enough of the right water...

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:41.714 align:middle line:90%
>> The right water.

00:19:41.714 --> 00:19:42.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. If we're not...

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:43.483 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll get into that.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:44.717 align:middle line:84%
>> ...yeah, if we're
not drinking enough

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:46.953 align:middle line:84%
of the right alkaline
water, if our stomach is --

00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:50.823 align:middle line:84%
is having to deal with too
much acids from protein...

00:19:50.823 --> 00:19:51.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Inflammation.

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.027 align:middle line:84%
>> ...or if there's too
much sugar in the diet,

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:58.264 align:middle line:84%
which is an acid, then our
systems for elimination begin

00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:02.602 align:middle line:84%
to break down and so the urinary
tract system, the bowel system,

00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
the skin starts clogging
up and --

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.773 align:middle line:84%
and we're not sweating
when we're exercising

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:08.141 align:middle line:84%
or we're not breathing
deep enough.

00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:12.178 align:middle line:84%
We're not removing that carbonic
acid or carbon dioxide out.

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:14.847 align:middle line:84%
And when that builds up, this
is when we start getting sick.

00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:16.049 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.885 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
to begin to restore that,

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:22.188 align:middle line:84%
because you can get oxidative
stress from just walking outside

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:23.656 align:middle line:90%
and breathing the air.

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that environment is a
contributing factor to acidity.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.429 align:middle line:90%
It's one. Other is metabolism,

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:32.665 align:middle line:84%
probably the major one is
what we eat and what we drink,

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:35.835 align:middle line:84%
a major contributors to excess
acidity, which then leads

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:37.303 align:middle line:90%
to sickness and disease.

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%
And our break down of the
four elimination organs

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:44.277 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible to keep our
bodies alkaline in it's design.

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:47.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. So this next slide
basically shows what our

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:48.548 align:middle line:90%
body needs.

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:51.484 align:middle line:84%
It's our body is slightly
alkaline by design...

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:52.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:53.586 align:middle line:90%
>> ...and what we need is --

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.724 align:middle line:84%
is something that naturally
buffers the acidic states

00:20:57.724 --> 00:20:58.791 align:middle line:90%
of our body, right?

00:20:58.791 --> 00:20:59.993 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:01.961 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the most
important things is salt.

00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And the reason I say salt,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.865 align:middle line:84%
because salt is a
primary element

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:07.066 align:middle line:90%
to make an alkaline buffer

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.235 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
producing every second,

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:10.803 align:middle line:90%
every moment of our lives.

00:21:10.803 --> 00:21:12.739 align:middle line:90%
It's called sodium bicarbonate.

00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:15.007 align:middle line:84%
And without salt, we
can't produce this very,

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.344 align:middle line:84%
very important alkaline
buffer to neutralize the acids

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:20.813 align:middle line:84%
that are produced
within our bodies.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:22.515 align:middle line:90%
>> So what kind of salt?

00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I like whole salts.

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.453 align:middle line:84%
Salts that haven't
been overly processed,

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.455 align:middle line:90%
that haven't been deionized

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.558 align:middle line:84%
or where they've extracted
all the other minerals

00:21:32.558 --> 00:21:35.395 align:middle line:84%
and just left a --
a sodium chloride,

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:36.429 align:middle line:90%
but I like whole salts.

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.597 align:middle line:90%
Sea salts.

00:21:37.597 --> 00:21:38.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Sea salts?

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:40.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.235 align:middle line:84%
>> The -- the whole
form of the sea salt,

00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:44.771 align:middle line:84%
like the big huge grain
sea salt or does it matter?

00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:46.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you have to
-- you have to --

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:48.975 align:middle line:84%
grind those down and a good
salt will dissolve in water

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:52.378 align:middle line:84%
and will stay in solution
without falling out.

00:21:52.378 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because if you want to
find out whether the salt

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.216 align:middle line:84%
that you have is a good salt,
put it in a glass of water,

00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:59.786 align:middle line:84%
stir it up, and then come
back the next morning

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:02.221 align:middle line:84%
and if the granules or the
salt particles are on --

00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:04.023 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the glass,

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:05.958 align:middle line:84%
then you know this
is not a good salt.

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.727 align:middle line:84%
>> What would that mean,
that the granules are coated

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:90%
with something or it's just...

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:09.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Well it might be.

00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:11.297 align:middle line:90%
It might, of course, depending

00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:14.066 align:middle line:84%
on what the company that's
manufacturing the salt is

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.503 align:middle line:84%
putting in the salt, but you
want the salt in solution.

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:20.907 align:middle line:84%
You know, the body can only
use it in a colloidal form.

00:22:20.907 --> 00:22:24.911 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what about the
salt without the iodine in it?

00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:27.613 align:middle line:84%
Has that normally
been processed?

00:22:27.613 --> 00:22:28.948 align:middle line:90%
>> All -- yeah, these --

00:22:28.948 --> 00:22:31.417 align:middle line:84%
these are salts that have been
processed and then iodine,

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:32.985 align:middle line:84%
which I believe in
wholeheartedly

00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that we are deficient
in iodine...

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.923 align:middle line:90%
>> ...that we need iodine --

00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:40.193 align:middle line:84%
and potassium iodide and
potassium iodine are two forms

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:43.396 align:middle line:84%
of iodine that we need to
support the alkaline design

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:47.233 align:middle line:84%
of the body and extracting
that from the salt is not good,

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:50.002 align:middle line:84%
which it's naturally
occurring in real salts.

00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:52.405 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to ask about people
with thyroid conditions...

00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:53.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and Hashimoto's and so
forth and the iodine factor

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
because I always hear that
this is a big controversy.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.845 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel about that?

00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:02.281 align:middle line:84%
>> In -- in my realm, because
we're testing the thyroids,

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:07.286 align:middle line:84%
and over 90% of the thyroids
we test using ultrasound,

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.454 align:middle line:90%
we are finding cysts.

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:10.556 align:middle line:90%
We're finding complex tumors.

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:13.659 align:middle line:84%
We're finding stones
on the thyroid

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's a result
of Chernobyl, of Fukushima,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.399 align:middle line:84%
and radioactive iodine that's
been dumped into the ocean

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.002 align:middle line:84%
that we're now -- that
we're now experiencing here,

00:23:23.002 --> 00:23:26.873 align:middle line:84%
but there's so many deficiencies
in the thyroid as a result

00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:28.608 align:middle line:90%
of a deficiency in alkalinity

00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:31.744 align:middle line:84%
and there's a very
important mineral salt iodine.

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's not enough

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.181 align:middle line:84%
to really light the
Hashimoto's on fire.

00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:39.285 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's a minute amount
that comes in salt or kelp.

00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Is -- is that what
you're saying?

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah I'm saying
that, but it's also the fact

00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:84%
that we're overstressed by
too much acidity in our bodies

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.561 align:middle line:90%
and the -- and the thyroid is --

00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:51.731 align:middle line:84%
it's main purpose is to manage
the energy levels of our body,

00:23:51.731 --> 00:23:56.269 align:middle line:84%
so it's becoming hyperactive
before it goes hypoactive.

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:58.471 align:middle line:84%
Once -- I want everyone
to understand

00:23:58.471 --> 00:24:01.674 align:middle line:84%
that it's very important to
have their thyroids checked

00:24:01.674 --> 00:24:04.911 align:middle line:84%
out not using radiation,
but using ultrasound

00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.947 align:middle line:84%
because there is no radiation
in ultrasound and you can pick

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:10.249 align:middle line:84%
up any imperfections that
may be in the thyroid

00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:14.887 align:middle line:84%
and then start taking
iodine as a supplement

00:24:14.887 --> 00:24:19.158 align:middle line:84%
to help protect you
against, you know, tumors.

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:23.262 align:middle line:84%
>> What do antibodies look like
in a blood cell analysis --

00:24:23.262 --> 00:24:24.997 align:middle line:90%
an autoimmune disorder?

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.332 align:middle line:90%
What would that look like?

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:29.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Well antibodies, of
course, for those who know,

00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:33.506 align:middle line:84%
are created by the body in
order to neutralize antigens

00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:36.976 align:middle line:84%
or let's say toxins
that come into the body

00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:38.477 align:middle line:84%
that the body needs
to neutralize.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.947 align:middle line:84%
So an antibody is
basically an antioxidant.

00:24:40.947 --> 00:24:42.515 align:middle line:90%
It's an antacid.

00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:45.651 align:middle line:84%
And the white cells,
particularly the lymphocytes...

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:50.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Secrete chemicals to help
to reduce acidity in the form

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:55.895 align:middle line:84%
of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxyl
radicals to neutralize acidity,

00:24:55.895 --> 00:24:59.298 align:middle line:84%
but an antibody also
is a protein that helps

00:24:59.298 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:90%
to -- to neutralize acids.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.903 align:middle line:84%
And these are produced
as a protection to help

00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:06.172 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the alkaline
design of the body.

00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:08.574 align:middle line:84%
>> And if there are too
many of them, then it --

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
it's again like having
the hyperthyroidism?

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:12.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Well if there's too many,

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:14.213 align:middle line:84%
it means that your
body's highly acidic.

00:25:14.213 --> 00:25:17.283 align:middle line:84%
As you reduce acidity,
the antibodies come down.

00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:19.318 align:middle line:90%
We found this with HIV.

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:20.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the only
scientist in the world

00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:25.858 align:middle line:84%
that successfully has reversed
HIV by reversing the symptom

00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:29.428 align:middle line:84%
of this antibody, HIV antibody,
not by treating the disease,

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:31.163 align:middle line:84%
but by changing the
internal environment.

00:25:31.163 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:84%
It comes back to the
fish bowl metaphor.

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:35.101 align:middle line:84%
If the individual
person is sick,

00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:38.804 align:middle line:84%
you don't treat the disease,
you change the internal fluids,

00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:41.641 align:middle line:84%
which then affect the
cells of the body.

00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:42.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. All right.

00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:43.976 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to that.

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:46.779 align:middle line:84%
There's a scale that we have
here in this slide of the --

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:50.216 align:middle line:84%
the acidity, the neutrality,
and the alkaline system.

00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:51.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:25:51.317 --> 00:25:53.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. This is
basically what it looks like

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:53.786 align:middle line:90%
and if you were to get a...

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:54.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:55.921 align:middle line:84%
>> ...pH stick at the
store you want to be right

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:58.524 align:middle line:90%
in that small zone right there.

00:25:58.524 --> 00:25:59.558 align:middle line:90%
>> You want to be green.

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.227 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in
the green-blue zone.

00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:02.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:26:02.628 --> 00:26:05.231 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you're dealing with a
-- a serious health challenge,

00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:06.999 align:middle line:90%
then, you know, the pH's

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:10.236 align:middle line:84%
that we're running are running
anywhere from 9.5 up to 10.

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:13.773 align:middle line:84%
So the urine and saliva
will actually go purple,

00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:16.008 align:middle line:84%
because we're forcing
hyperalkalinity

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:19.879 align:middle line:84%
to reduce antibodies, to
reduce acidity, to reduce --

00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:22.181 align:middle line:84%
to support the white
blood cells, such as in --

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:26.052 align:middle line:84%
in immune deficiency, we want
to support the white blood cells

00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
by managing and maintaining
cleanliness

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.488 align:middle line:84%
in the internal fluids
of the body.

00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:30.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Makes perfect sense.

00:26:30.823 --> 00:26:31.657 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:31.657 --> 00:26:32.858 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about how to do this.

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned you want to
stay in the green zone.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.596 align:middle line:84%
And you are a big
proponent of green foods.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. I started the
green movement 30 years ago.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.133 align:middle line:90%
It's now becoming popular.

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:42.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank God [laughter].

00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:42.568 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:43.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. Yeah.

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:45.871 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we cannot
live without green.

00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.941 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all green plants, we
have a beautiful relationship.

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They provide us oxygen for life

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.914 align:middle line:84%
and we provide them
carbon dioxide for life.

00:26:54.914 --> 00:26:56.582 align:middle line:90%
They provide us chlorophyll,

00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:58.951 align:middle line:84%
which helps to build
our blood, you know.

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:03.055 align:middle line:84%
And without green it's
very, very difficult

00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:90%
to -- to stay healthy.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.493 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a really
big part of my lifestyle

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:12.064 align:middle line:84%
and diet is I always start out
with a quart of green juices

00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:14.533 align:middle line:84%
and I'll -- I'll drink
anywhere from four to six quarts

00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:17.703 align:middle line:90%
of green juice every day.

00:27:17.703 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know that your wife
is an amazing green food chef

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.074 align:middle line:90%
basically [laughter].

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:23.209 align:middle line:90%
>> She is.

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:25.711 align:middle line:84%
She -- she started --
she's the guru and --

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:30.082 align:middle line:84%
and the founder of -- of the
green shake and the green milk.

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:31.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Well she's got
some amazing recipes

00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:33.419 align:middle line:90%
on your website, which I saw.

00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:84%
There was a great one
with avocado, lime,

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.492 align:middle line:90%
lemon juice, and celery.

00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:41.093 align:middle line:84%
That was a clean
drink [laughter].

00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:42.394 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very clean.

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:43.696 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's all
I've been drinking

00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:45.898 align:middle line:90%
since -- since this morning.

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:48.267 align:middle line:84%
And when you're green,
you're clean.

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:48.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:49.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay?

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.504 align:middle line:90%
>> And when you're green,

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:53.172 align:middle line:84%
for those who are
overweight, you're lean.

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:55.341 align:middle line:84%
So the more you green
up the diet,

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.009 align:middle line:84%
the cleaner and leaner
you'll be.

00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:00.813 align:middle line:84%
>> And then someone who has been
drinking a lot of green juices,

00:28:00.813 --> 00:28:03.082 align:middle line:84%
do you get those plump-looking
blood cells in a --

00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:04.416 align:middle line:90%
in a blood cell analysis.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:06.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Your -- your blood changes.

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.853 align:middle line:84%
It's called legalized
blood doping.

00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:08.854 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter].

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:09.922 align:middle line:84%
>> And the way you
do that, in fact,

00:28:09.922 --> 00:28:12.158 align:middle line:84%
we measure the hematocrit
and hemoglobin.

00:28:12.158 --> 00:28:15.628 align:middle line:84%
We measure that center
molecule of the red blood cell.

00:28:15.628 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:84%
My range is 17.6 with
a hematocrit of 52%.

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:90%
For anyone who knows the blood,

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:25.237 align:middle line:84%
this is an extraordinary
concentration of hemoglobin,

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:29.408 align:middle line:84%
but it's essential, because the
hemoglobin is the oxygen carrier

00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that carries oxygen
from the lungs --

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.746 align:middle line:84%
the lungs to every
cell in the human body.

00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:35.648 align:middle line:84%
And the volume of that
blood is significant.

00:28:35.648 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
greening up your diet,

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.085 align:middle line:90%
your blood counts come up.

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:42.054 align:middle line:84%
>> You would be illegal
if you were a cyclist.

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.088 align:middle line:90%
All right [laughter].

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you -- in
fact, the IOC has --

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:47.793 align:middle line:84%
has approved, they haven't
disapproved green drinking.

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:50.062 align:middle line:84%
It's actually legalized
blood doping.

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.431 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about 15
steps to alkalinizing the body.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:28:55.835 --> 00:28:56.902 align:middle line:84%
>> And green juice
is one of them.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:58.771 align:middle line:84%
Avocado is one of
your favorites, right?

00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:00.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the most important
food that you can eat,

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the perfect food because of
its monounsaturated oils.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.979 align:middle line:90%
It's 15% protein.

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:84%
It contains a higher source
of potassium than bananas

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.483 align:middle line:90%
without all the sugar.

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.787 align:middle line:84%
It is probably the perfect
food for an athlete.

00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:16.388 align:middle line:84%
The perfect food for
somebody who's dealing

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:17.957 align:middle line:90%
with a serious health challenge.

00:29:17.957 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Now are you a vegetarian?

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:21.493 align:middle line:90%
>> I call myself an alkalarian.

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:22.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:25.164 align:middle line:84%
>> An alkalarian is a vegan
who's focused specifically

00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:90%
on green foods and green drinks.

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so it's beyond
vegetarianism

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.002 align:middle line:90%
and veganism [laughter].

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:33.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. It's not only raw,
but it's raw alkalarian.

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:36.642 align:middle line:84%
So all my food is --
is prepared naturally.

00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:38.544 align:middle line:90%
We either juice it or blend it

00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:40.813 align:middle line:84%
or I just eat it
naturally out of the ground.

00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:44.049 align:middle line:84%
And most of the foods that I
eat we grow right at our ranch

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:47.353 align:middle line:84%
at the pH Miracle Center
in the Rancho del Sol.

00:29:47.353 --> 00:29:49.989 align:middle line:84%
So we have a forest
of avocados and --

00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:52.892 align:middle line:84%
and raw foods that we
partake of on a daily basis.

00:29:52.892 --> 00:29:53.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wonderful.

00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:54.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:29:54.994 --> 00:29:58.097 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this slide it talks
about 15 steps to perfect health

00:29:58.097 --> 00:30:00.633 align:middle line:84%
and how to maintain
a perfect or a --

00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:04.203 align:middle line:84%
a good pH, which what did
you say pH stands for.

00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:06.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I affectionately
refer to pH

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.607 align:middle line:90%
as meaning perfectly healthy.

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:11.744 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, it refers to
the potential of hydrogen.

00:30:11.744 --> 00:30:15.281 align:middle line:84%
We are actually measuring
concentrations in the body

00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
or in the food to
determine its acid load.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.552 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen is just
another word for proton

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and the higher the concentration
of hydrogen, the more acidic

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:84%
that food is or the more
acidic your body is.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.562 align:middle line:90%
So you want it more alkaline.

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:33.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. So then let's
talk about ways to do that.

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.266 align:middle line:90%
So we talked about food.

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:36.302 align:middle line:90%
We talked about green foods.

00:30:36.302 --> 00:30:39.872 align:middle line:84%
Exercise. This here is a
picture of your daughter?

00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:42.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's my
daughter, Ashley,

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:45.811 align:middle line:84%
and she's just a beautiful
soul inside and out.

00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:49.014 align:middle line:84%
She's -- you know, she's the
mother of three children.

00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:49.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:30:49.982 --> 00:30:51.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I am -- I'm
a grandparent.

00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:52.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice [laughter].

00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:55.154 align:middle line:84%
>> For those who are
wondering how old I am, I'm 62.

00:30:55.154 --> 00:30:59.825 align:middle line:84%
And my wife who, you know, is
just in perfect health too,

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:03.629 align:middle line:84%
in fact, she has a perfect
six pack, she's 60 this year.

00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness!

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.533 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, she
takes care of her health.

00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:08.767 align:middle line:90%
We run every day.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:90%
We do Younga Yoga, which is a --

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.207 align:middle line:84%
a version of rebounding
to hip-hop music and...

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:16.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:31:16.008 --> 00:31:17.876 align:middle line:90%
>> ...doing yoga exercising.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:18.844 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot...

00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:19.411 align:middle line:90%
>> So you do a lot.

00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:19.912 align:middle line:90%
>> ...of fun.

00:31:19.912 --> 00:31:21.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:22.414 align:middle line:84%
>> My daughter here is doing
a yoga move, but she --

00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:25.484 align:middle line:84%
she was diagnosed
11 years ago with --

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:29.788 align:middle line:84%
with brain cancer and it
was while she was pregnant

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:33.058 align:middle line:84%
in her third trimester and,
you know, there was a couple

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.893 align:middle line:84%
of times where we thought
we were going to lose her.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:31:36.295 --> 00:31:41.467 align:middle line:84%
>> But the baby was healthy at
birth and -- and just last --

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:46.405 align:middle line:84%
this last few months after
11 years she was declared

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:47.506 align:middle line:90%
cancer free.

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:50.075 align:middle line:84%
And so she's been on
this program, you know,

00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
to prevent her condition
getting worse and to be able

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.081 align:middle line:90%
to live a normal life.

00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.783 align:middle line:90%
And drug free.

00:31:57.783 --> 00:31:58.817 align:middle line:90%
No chemotherapy.

00:31:58.817 --> 00:32:00.719 align:middle line:90%
No radiation and no surgery.

00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:02.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Had she been on -- did
you raise her on green food.

00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:04.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:04.023 --> 00:32:06.091 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did she get to that
state of the brain cancer?

00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:07.726 align:middle line:90%
>> It was an injury.

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:09.895 align:middle line:84%
When you have a physical
injury --

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:11.897 align:middle line:84%
she was a gymnast and
landed on her head.

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:15.167 align:middle line:84%
And when you have trauma,
that can damage cells,

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:18.537 align:middle line:84%
which then can become cancerous
and form a tumor and this,

00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:21.040 align:middle line:90%
of course, formed in her brain.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.743 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't realize that until
she seizured and then we...

00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:26.145 align:middle line:90%
>> In her third trimester.

00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:29.848 align:middle line:84%
>> ...we did a PET scan and we
saw the tumor, but -- it's --

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:90%
everything is great now and --

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.253 align:middle line:84%
and it's all because of
this lifestyle and diet.

00:32:34.253 --> 00:32:37.122 align:middle line:84%
And she was told that she
would never have children again

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:39.024 align:middle line:84%
after this -- this
-- this first birth,

00:32:39.024 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
but she's had two more children
and she wants to have another.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh. She's healthy.

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:44.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Now did you, when you
discovered this diagnosis,

00:32:45.998 --> 00:32:49.268 align:middle line:84%
did you do anything
different with her in --

00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:51.303 align:middle line:90%
in order to shrink this tumor?

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:52.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.239 align:middle line:84%
Here again, in shrinking
tumors you have

00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:55.274 align:middle line:90%
to change the environment,

00:32:55.274 --> 00:32:57.509 align:middle line:84%
because the tumor
is the solution

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:59.278 align:middle line:90%
to cancer cells spreading.

00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:02.347 align:middle line:84%
So it encapsulates those cells
which have spoiled by metabolic

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.716 align:middle line:84%
or dietary acid or
some physical trauma.

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.619 align:middle line:84%
>> It encapsules that, so it
doesn't -- it's a domino effect.

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:09.388 align:middle line:84%
So one cell doesn't
spoil another cell.

00:33:09.388 --> 00:33:10.456 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a metaphor.

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:11.657 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
to understand this.

00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:13.592 align:middle line:84%
If you take a rotten apple
and put it in a bushel

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:15.294 align:middle line:90%
of healthy apples, what happens

00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:16.562 align:middle line:84%
to the rest -- rest
of the apples?

00:33:16.562 --> 00:33:17.863 align:middle line:90%
>> The fungus grows -- it's...

00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:19.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the acids
from that one apple --

00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.266 align:middle line:90%
apple will spoil another apple.

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.403 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the body
has a very unique way

00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:84%
of encapsulating things to
prevent that spoiling effect.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:30.342 align:middle line:84%
You see people don't realize
this or maybe they do,

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:31.877 align:middle line:90%
that we don't get old, we mold.

00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:90%
It's a fermentation process

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.981 align:middle line:84%
and to slow the aging
process down...

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:37.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:33:37.316 --> 00:33:38.917 align:middle line:84%
>> ...you have to manage the
internal fluids of the body.

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we handled
this particular condition.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.324 align:middle line:84%
Rather than opening up her skull
and disturbing the environment,

00:33:45.324 --> 00:33:48.060 align:middle line:84%
we saturated the tissues
with alkalinity, which is one

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.329 align:middle line:90%
of the four things that I do.

00:33:50.329 --> 00:33:51.697 align:middle line:90%
There's four of them.

00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:54.199 align:middle line:84%
The first one is hyperprofuse
the tissues with alkalinity.

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:56.835 align:middle line:84%
The second is open up the
channels of elimination.

00:33:56.835 --> 00:33:59.905 align:middle line:84%
The third one is to build
the blood, you know,

00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:01.807 align:middle line:84%
and to restore health
to the core.

00:34:01.807 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
To the root system of our body,
which is the intestinal villi.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.946 align:middle line:84%
When we -- when we
focus from the core out,

00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:11.249 align:middle line:84%
this is when we can regain
or reclaim our health.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow! That's a great system.

00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:14.286 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:34:14.286 --> 00:34:17.722 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the energy
that is inside food in order

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.892 align:middle line:84%
to have those types
of healing properties.

00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:34:21.293 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have a slide here that
talks about the energy of food.

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.197 align:middle line:90%
Explain what this is.

00:34:25.197 --> 00:34:27.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a Russian scientist
by the name of Kirlian was --

00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:29.868 align:middle line:90%
was taking photographs of --

00:34:29.868 --> 00:34:33.372 align:middle line:84%
using his technique of a life
force energy that's coming off

00:34:33.372 --> 00:34:34.640 align:middle line:90%
the food.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we eat food
not for its caloric value,

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:40.278 align:middle line:90%
but for its electrical value.

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.546 align:middle line:90%
We are electrical beings.

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.582 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies run on electrons.

00:34:43.582 --> 00:34:46.418 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see live
or we eat live foods,

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:49.254 align:middle line:84%
we're putting more electrical
energy into our bodies.

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:50.655 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like batteries.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't buy the acid batteries.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.359 align:middle line:90%
We buy the alkaline batteries.

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:55.494 align:middle line:90%
They're electron rich.

00:34:55.494 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to recharge our
bodies with live, green,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.867 align:middle line:84%
electron-rich foods and that's
what these pictures are showing.

00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:03.902 align:middle line:84%
The picture on --
in the middle --

00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:06.672 align:middle line:84%
actually the picture on the left
is showing the life force energy

00:35:06.672 --> 00:35:08.273 align:middle line:90%
coming from a hamburger.

00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:10.509 align:middle line:84%
The middle one is
a lentil sprout.

00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:12.978 align:middle line:84%
These are live, electrically
active.

00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:16.815 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, in the --
the right side there is --

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:20.853 align:middle line:84%
is taking the picture from
the bottle that's open --

00:35:20.853 --> 00:35:24.723 align:middle line:84%
we're taking a picture of our
-- our concentrated green powder

00:35:24.723 --> 00:35:28.327 align:middle line:84%
that you put into the water
to make the green juice.

00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:29.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think that the powder

00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:31.697 align:middle line:84%
versus live juicing
is any different?

00:35:31.697 --> 00:35:34.399 align:middle line:84%
I mean is the powder
more convenient and it's

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:37.069 align:middle line:84%
when you can get to the
live juicing always do that?

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:40.138 align:middle line:84%
>> The benefits of the powder
is -- is number one, it's --

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:43.041 align:middle line:84%
it's convenient, but number
two it's a concentrate.

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:46.144 align:middle line:84%
So what -- we take out all the
water and we create a 28 to 30

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
to one concentration of
wheat grass, barley grass,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.149 align:middle line:84%
kamut grass, straw grass
-- [inaudible] grass,

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:53.418 align:middle line:84%
with broccoli, spinach,
celery, cucumber,

00:35:53.418 --> 00:35:56.455 align:middle line:84%
avocado in a concentrated
form, so when you take

00:35:56.455 --> 00:35:59.825 align:middle line:84%
like six scoops you're
literally increasing the amount

00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:01.059 align:middle line:90%
of vegetables and fruit --

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.427 align:middle line:84%
alkaline fruits that
you're eating.

00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:04.363 align:middle line:84%
So it's a more concentrated
and we...

00:36:04.363 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.498 align:middle line:84%
>> ...get a faster
response from the powder

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.567 align:middle line:84%
than we do the --
from the fresh juice.

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:10.869 align:middle line:84%
>> From someone who has
a gluten intolerance

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:13.438 align:middle line:84%
and a wheat sensitivity,
is the barley grass --

00:36:13.438 --> 00:36:15.741 align:middle line:84%
does that affect that
type of sensitivity?

00:36:15.741 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> No because we're -- we're
not -- we're sprouting it.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.846 align:middle line:84%
We're taking it from a
grain to a -- a vegetable.

00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.981 align:middle line:90%
So there is no gluten.

00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh. It doesn't exist
within the hull of the...

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.486 align:middle line:84%
>> No because that all
comes out in the sprout.

00:36:27.486 --> 00:36:28.887 align:middle line:90%
>> In the sprouting process?

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:30.689 align:middle line:84%
>> In the sprouting process you
-- you -- there is no gluten.

00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:32.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for explaining
that today [laughter].

00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:33.925 align:middle line:84%
>> That's -- you're
welcome [laughter].

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter] I never knew that.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.561 align:middle line:90%
All right, so now -- I noticed

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that Bill Clinton
was on your website.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.365 align:middle line:90%
Did you help him heal in his...

00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:43.001 align:middle line:84%
>> You know he's been
on the alkaline program

00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.437 align:middle line:84%
for several years and the
reason why he got on it

00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and started moving more to
a plant-based vegan diet is

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.777 align:middle line:84%
because of the challenges
he had with his heart.

00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:52.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:53.578 align:middle line:90%
>> And the surgeries he had.

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.114 align:middle line:84%
And so now he manages
his pH as well.

00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:57.783 align:middle line:84%
>> And does he eat all these
foods, these beautiful foods

00:36:57.783 --> 00:36:58.884 align:middle line:84%
that we have here on
this [inaudible] here?

00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:00.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:01.586 align:middle line:90%
>> So name some of the foods

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:02.721 align:middle line:84%
that you eat -- that
you recommend.

00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of my favorite,
avocado, we named that.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.328 align:middle line:84%
Cucumber, spinach,
kale, collard greens.

00:37:09.328 --> 00:37:12.364 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli is one -- one
of the big favorites.

00:37:12.364 --> 00:37:15.867 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I love
grapefruit and I love coconut.

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.303 align:middle line:84%
>> So things like
broccoli, they don't tend

00:37:18.303 --> 00:37:20.772 align:middle line:84%
to have more of an
acidic effect?

00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:22.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:37:22.207 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli is a great source for
protein, but it's a great source

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.612 align:middle line:90%
for chlorophyll as well.

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.815 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get some acids

00:37:29.815 --> 00:37:31.183 align:middle line:90%
from any food that you eat.

00:37:31.183 --> 00:37:34.052 align:middle line:84%
It's minimizes and
on a -- on a --

00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:36.154 align:middle line:84%
on a, let's say a
debit/credit, you're going

00:37:36.154 --> 00:37:38.123 align:middle line:84%
to get more alkaline
credits then you are going

00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:39.558 align:middle line:90%
to get acidic debits.

00:37:39.558 --> 00:37:40.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. Okay [laughter].

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:41.393 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:37:41.393 --> 00:37:42.327 align:middle line:90%
>> So if you're looking at it

00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:43.628 align:middle line:84%
from an accounting
point of view.

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.464 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why I said
it that way, but...

00:37:45.464 --> 00:37:46.131 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes sense.

00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:47.132 align:middle line:90%
It's about balance.

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:48.367 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've ever
balanced a bank --

00:37:48.367 --> 00:37:51.503 align:middle line:84%
if you ever balanced
your bank statement...

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:53.905 align:middle line:84%
>> ...you're looking at your
debits and you're looking

00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:55.907 align:middle line:84%
at your credits and
you want to eat foods,

00:37:55.907 --> 00:37:57.275 align:middle line:90%
like lemons and limes.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.845 align:middle line:84%
There -- there's this idea that
lemons and lime are acidic,

00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:01.646 align:middle line:90%
but you see the alkaline buffers

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:05.016 align:middle line:84%
in the potassium bicarbonate are
greater than its acidic value;

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.719 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you're
getting more alkaline credits

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:90%
than acidic debits.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.088 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how that
works [laughter].

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:10.922 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make more sense?

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:38:12.524 --> 00:38:13.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, wait a
minute, I thought pH

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.827 align:middle line:90%
of a lemon is like 3 to 3.5.

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:19.965 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but when you break this
whole thing you're actually

00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:23.702 align:middle line:84%
getting more alkalinity through
the increase of mineral salts

00:38:23.702 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that these lemons
and limes have.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. That makes sense.

00:38:26.338 --> 00:38:28.607 align:middle line:84%
Now exercise, again,
it's about balance.

00:38:28.607 --> 00:38:31.276 align:middle line:84%
So what types of
exercises do you suggest?

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:34.346 align:middle line:84%
You have a -- a slide
here that shows several

00:38:34.346 --> 00:38:35.614 align:middle line:84%
of the exercises
that you suggest.

00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:37.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think the most
important thing about exercise,

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.618 align:middle line:84%
you have to find something
that you really enjoy.

00:38:39.618 --> 00:38:42.988 align:middle line:84%
That you can do at least
five or six time a week.

00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:46.792 align:middle line:84%
And you should exercise at least
one hour a day where you --

00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:50.562 align:middle line:84%
and the most important part
of exercising is circulation

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:53.098 align:middle line:84%
and through circulation that
opens up the pores of the skin,

00:38:53.098 --> 00:38:55.801 align:middle line:84%
activates the lymphatic system
to open up the pores of the skin

00:38:55.801 --> 00:38:58.637 align:middle line:84%
and remove these acidic waste
products that get pushed

00:38:58.637 --> 00:39:00.672 align:middle line:84%
from the blood into
the connective tissue.

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.074 align:middle line:90%
Those need to come out.

00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:05.377 align:middle line:84%
So sweating is a very, very
important part of exercise.

00:39:05.377 --> 00:39:07.612 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed that weight
lighting is not on here.

00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:09.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Weight lifting is
really good for tonality.

00:39:09.815 --> 00:39:13.752 align:middle line:84%
By creating a static contraction
with weights, creates blood flow

00:39:13.752 --> 00:39:15.153 align:middle line:84%
to that particular
area of the body

00:39:15.153 --> 00:39:17.322 align:middle line:90%
that you're trying to build.

00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:20.525 align:middle line:84%
When blood flows to those parts
of the body, they differentiate

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:22.227 align:middle line:90%
into new muscle cells.

00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:25.764 align:middle line:84%
So the best way you can build
healthy strong muscles is

00:39:25.764 --> 00:39:28.567 align:middle line:90%
by having healthy strong blood.

00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:31.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. And also, if you
combine weight lifting

00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:33.805 align:middle line:84%
with cardio that's
-- that's okay?

00:39:33.805 --> 00:39:34.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:37.375 align:middle line:84%
And you can alternate,
one day cardio,

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.711 align:middle line:90%
the next day lifting weights.

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of combine
it all together.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.014 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughter] Apparently
I can't see,

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
because weight lifting
is on that side.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well yes, I encourage
weight lifting.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I like -- I like
to teach people how

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.526 align:middle line:84%
to create what is called
static contraction.

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:57.762 align:middle line:84%
Where they're actually
creating a stress to a muscle

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:00.365 align:middle line:84%
for about 30 seconds,
allowing the blood to flow

00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:02.934 align:middle line:84%
to that particular muscle so
the blood can differentiate

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:04.436 align:middle line:90%
into new muscle cells.

00:40:04.436 --> 00:40:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And grow more blood?

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.238 align:middle line:90%
Is that...

00:40:06.238 --> 00:40:07.038 align:middle line:90%
>> No not grow more blood.

00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>> ...no?

00:40:07.973 --> 00:40:09.241 align:middle line:84%
>> That's reverse
transformation,

00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:11.243 align:middle line:90%
but blood becomes new muscle.

00:40:11.243 --> 00:40:13.512 align:middle line:84%
It's blood that becomes
muscle, but when you're sick,

00:40:13.512 --> 00:40:15.347 align:middle line:90%
it is muscle that becomes blood.

00:40:15.347 --> 00:40:17.048 align:middle line:84%
It's called reverse
transformation.

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. You mentioned that you
have a high hemoglobin rate.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.188 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you do that?

00:40:23.188 --> 00:40:24.856 align:middle line:84%
How did you grow
your hemoglobin?

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you have to --
blood is made in the crypts

00:40:27.092 --> 00:40:28.627 align:middle line:90%
of the small intestine.

00:40:28.627 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Secondarily, it's made in
other places of the body.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.665 align:middle line:84%
It's generally thought the blood
is made in the bone marrow.

00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:34.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.101 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is not the
case unless you're sick.

00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:84%
The body goes into reverse
transformation making blood

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.505 align:middle line:90%
out of your own body cells.

00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:42.874 align:middle line:84%
So when you're healthy you
have to have a healthy core.

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:44.976 align:middle line:90%
Health begins in the core.

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:47.445 align:middle line:84%
And I usually say
in a humor sense,

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.648 align:middle line:84%
this is a gut feeling
that I have.

00:40:49.648 --> 00:40:53.318 align:middle line:84%
But scientifically when we look
at the people that are sick,

00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:57.689 align:middle line:84%
you know, we do autopsies of
those, it always shows damage

00:40:57.689 --> 00:41:01.459 align:middle line:84%
to the appendages, which are the
intestinal villi, which I call,

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.395 align:middle line:84%
affectionately, the
root system of our body.

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
When that's healthy,
everything else is healthy.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.501 align:middle line:84%
But when you're eating green
foods in a liquid state,

00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:12.671 align:middle line:84%
you can then increase stem
cell production and then

00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:84%
from stem cell to
the erythroblast,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.474 align:middle line:84%
from the erythroblast
to the erythrocyte,

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:19.244 align:middle line:84%
and this is how you
build healthy blood.

00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:22.447 align:middle line:84%
You build it by eating more
green foods and green drinks.

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:25.083 align:middle line:84%
>> I've often heard guests
say that the brain is located

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:26.017 align:middle line:90%
in the gut and you just...

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:27.185 align:middle line:90%
>> You have more brain cells

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:29.487 align:middle line:84%
in your gut then you
have in your head.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:34.259 align:middle line:84%
Decisions that you're making
begin first in the core

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.294 align:middle line:84%
and then are transmitted
to the head.

00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:38.463 align:middle line:84%
The head is not what's
making decisions.

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:40.732 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is in your core.

00:41:40.732 --> 00:41:41.967 align:middle line:90%
Everything is -- in fact,

00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:44.002 align:middle line:84%
over 50% of your blood
circulation is in your core.

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:47.439 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system and
your lymphatic system is all

00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:49.507 align:middle line:90%
concentrated in the gut.

00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:50.976 align:middle line:90%
>> That is fascinating.

00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:52.277 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for validating that.

00:41:52.277 --> 00:41:53.144 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot of sense.

00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:54.379 align:middle line:90%
So if you have a head trauma,

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:55.614 align:middle line:84%
you should really eat
health [laughter].

00:41:55.614 --> 00:41:57.449 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have -- you
want to restore health --

00:41:57.449 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and we've worked
with Alzheimer's

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.452 align:middle line:90%
and different forms of dementia.

00:42:00.452 --> 00:42:01.453 align:middle line:90%
>> And memory issues?

00:42:01.453 --> 00:42:02.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Memory issues.

00:42:02.654 --> 00:42:04.889 align:middle line:84%
Autism. But the focus
point is not the brain.

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:07.959 align:middle line:84%
The focus is the damage
that's been done to the gut.

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:11.329 align:middle line:84%
When we restore the health
gut, then we restore the brain.

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:12.731 align:middle line:90%
The cranial brain.

00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So now ironically
you call your system

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.268 align:middle line:84%
and your protocol
COWS [laughter].

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:20.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. You got to eat like a
cow if you want to be healthy.

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. That's what
you mean by that.

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:23.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. COW is actually
an acronym.

00:42:23.675 --> 00:42:25.777 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a slide
here that shows this.

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:26.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:27.579 align:middle line:90%
>> So explain this if you can.

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:28.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the C stands
for chlorophyll.

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:31.082 align:middle line:84%
As we increase more chlorophyll
or chlorophyll-rich foods

00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:33.618 align:middle line:84%
in our diet, this is when we
start building healthy blood.

00:42:33.618 --> 00:42:34.919 align:middle line:84%
When we start building
healthy blood,

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.688 align:middle line:84%
we then can regenerate
a new body.

00:42:36.688 --> 00:42:39.958 align:middle line:84%
And it takes about nine months
to regenerate a new body.

00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.826 align:middle line:90%
The O stands for oil.

00:42:41.826 --> 00:42:43.728 align:middle line:84%
Any stem cells is
going to be made

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:46.631 align:middle line:84%
or any embryonic cell is
going to be made in a --

00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:48.933 align:middle line:90%
in a vessel of fat or oil.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.436 align:middle line:84%
So oil becomes -- particularly
polyunsaturated oils,

00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:53.471 align:middle line:84%
which are more flexible
to make the membranes

00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:55.440 align:middle line:84%
that will then hold
the chlorophyll

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.142 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the new
stem cell and then

00:42:57.142 --> 00:42:59.544 align:middle line:84%
from there the new
embryonic and blood cells.

00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:00.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:03.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Water is critical, because
we are a body of water,

00:43:03.448 --> 00:43:05.884 align:middle line:84%
but alkaline water
to a pH of 9.5.

00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And S stands for
the mineral salts,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.256 align:middle line:84%
particularly sodium
chloride, potassium chloride.

00:43:11.256 --> 00:43:13.992 align:middle line:84%
These salts, magnesium,
and calcium are essential

00:43:13.992 --> 00:43:17.195 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the alkaline design
of the fluids of the body.

00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:20.098 align:middle line:84%
So these are my four
basic food groups.

00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So you could basically
take an avocado

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.202 align:middle line:84%
and you could put some
Himalayan sea salt on it

00:43:24.202 --> 00:43:26.004 align:middle line:84%
and squeeze a lemon and
that's a perfect meal for you?

00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:26.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:27.605 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds really good.

00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:28.306 align:middle line:90%
>> That's breakfast.

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:29.274 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds really...

00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.308 align:middle line:84%
>> You can add some
tomato in there.

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:30.975 align:middle line:90%
>> You could add...

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:31.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:34.179 align:middle line:84%
>> And so your -
your system of eating

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:37.515 align:middle line:84%
and drinking is what
you say restores.

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:40.351 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to get stem
cell therapy or anything else

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.188 align:middle line:84%
like that, it wouldn't be
as powerful as the food

00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:44.489 align:middle line:84%
that you put in your
body, right?

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:46.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. Because
we are what we eat.

00:43:46.324 --> 00:43:46.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:47.459 align:middle line:90%
>> As you said.

00:43:47.459 --> 00:43:48.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah earlier.

00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:49.694 align:middle line:90%
>> And you are what you think.

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:52.697 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to be healthy
you have to understand that life

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:54.399 align:middle line:90%
and death is in the blood.

00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:55.834 align:middle line:84%
The quality of your
blood depends --

00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:58.636 align:middle line:84%
determines the quality of your
bones, your muscles, your brain,

00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.405 align:middle line:90%
your heart, your liver.

00:44:00.405 --> 00:44:02.774 align:middle line:84%
If your blood is not healthy,
then these other organs

00:44:02.774 --> 00:44:04.843 align:middle line:84%
and organ systems do
not function properly.

00:44:04.843 --> 00:44:06.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Can we talk about water?

00:44:06.077 --> 00:44:07.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that tends to
be a very confusing topic.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.384 align:middle line:84%
I have seen alkaline water all
the way up to 9.5 pH level.

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:44:14.052 --> 00:44:15.053 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know?

00:44:15.053 --> 00:44:18.523 align:middle line:84%
How do we know what's
the best for us?

00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well when we understand that
our body does not digest food,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.696 align:middle line:84%
that we only have one instrument
in our body to breakdown food

00:44:24.696 --> 00:44:26.598 align:middle line:84%
or digest food and
that's our teeth.

00:44:26.598 --> 00:44:29.868 align:middle line:84%
We understand that salivary
glands are secreting alkalinity

00:44:29.868 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
-- in the form of sodium
bicarbonate, but the major organ

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:33.571 align:middle line:90%
of the human body, the stomach,

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.473 align:middle line:84%
is a major producer
of alkalinity.

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:38.943 align:middle line:84%
When we think about food,
we start secreting saliva.

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:41.412 align:middle line:84%
Our stomach starts
making sodium bicarbonate.

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.747 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
waste product

00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of producing sodium bicarbonate
is hydrochloric acid.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.952 align:middle line:84%
We have this idea,
scientifically,

00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:49.621 align:middle line:84%
and it's being taught
at a very young age,

00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:51.389 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
medical school,

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:54.159 align:middle line:84%
that our stomach digests
food and it does not.

00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:56.561 align:middle line:84%
When we understand that when
we drink alkaline water,

00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:58.997 align:middle line:84%
when we drink before our
meals, during our meals,

00:44:58.997 --> 00:45:00.064 align:middle line:90%
and after our meals

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:02.066 align:middle line:84%
and we neutralize the
hydrochloric acid,

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:04.502 align:middle line:84%
this is when we prevent
acid reflux.

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:06.571 align:middle line:84%
This is when we prevent
upset stomachs.

00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:12.644 align:middle line:84%
This is when we reverse GERD
or esophageal conditions.

00:45:12.644 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We prevent stomach
cancer and bowel cancers

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.015 align:middle line:90%
when we start alkalizing.

00:45:17.015 --> 00:45:19.617 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
recommend 9.5 water

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:22.587 align:middle line:84%
at a high-electron
concentration, which is measured

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:26.357 align:middle line:84%
in millivolts at
negative 450 millivolts,

00:45:26.357 --> 00:45:28.293 align:middle line:84%
it's called the oxidative
reduction potential.

00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:31.296 align:middle line:84%
When we're drinking alkaline
water, which is saturated

00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:35.333 align:middle line:84%
in electrons, this is when
we neutralize what we eat,

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:36.901 align:middle line:84%
what we drink, and
what we think.

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:41.539 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I recommend
drinking water and lots of it

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:43.775 align:middle line:90%
that is functionally structured.

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:44.809 align:middle line:90%
Functionally structured to be...

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:45.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Meaning?

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:47.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Meaning clean purified water.

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:50.949 align:middle line:84%
Second alkaline with
a pH of 9.5,

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:53.952 align:middle line:84%
electron-rich negative
450 millivolts,

00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:57.288 align:middle line:84%
and functionally structured
to smaller molecules,

00:45:57.288 --> 00:45:59.624 align:middle line:84%
because when water's
acid it clusters

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:02.126 align:middle line:84%
and forms these big water
molecules and that's why

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.862 align:middle line:84%
when people drink,
let's say tap water

00:46:03.862 --> 00:46:06.698 align:middle line:84%
or bottled water say I
can't drink that much water.

00:46:06.698 --> 00:46:07.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:46:07.966 --> 00:46:08.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctor [inaudible] say
drink four to six liters.

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:09.801 align:middle line:90%
You cannot, I agree.

00:46:09.801 --> 00:46:11.369 align:middle line:84%
You cannot drink
that much water,

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:13.638 align:middle line:84%
but when you're drinking
functionally structured,

00:46:13.638 --> 00:46:16.975 align:middle line:84%
monomolecular water that
has smaller molecules,

00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:19.944 align:middle line:84%
then that water goes
into the tissues rather

00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:21.346 align:middle line:90%
than into your gut and then out.

00:46:21.346 --> 00:46:22.347 align:middle line:90%
>> And stays there.

00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.414 align:middle line:84%
>> And the body's
trying to get out.

00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:25.516 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is wetter water?

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:28.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Well wetter water is
functionally structured water

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.255 align:middle line:84%
that has a smaller
molecular structure.

00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:32.991 align:middle line:84%
So it's either one molecule
of H two O or maybe three

00:46:32.991 --> 00:46:36.261 align:middle line:84%
to five molecules, rather than
the typical structure of water

00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:38.563 align:middle line:84%
in a bottle or coming
out of the tap,

00:46:38.563 --> 00:46:41.299 align:middle line:84%
which is 20 to 40 molecules
structured together.

00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:43.735 align:middle line:90%
So you have big water molecules,

00:46:43.735 --> 00:46:46.104 align:middle line:84%
when you drink it can't
go into the tissues.

00:46:46.104 --> 00:46:48.072 align:middle line:84%
It can't go into the
cell, it's too big.

00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:48.706 align:middle line:90%
>> It's too big.

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:49.474 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's heavy.

00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:50.808 align:middle line:90%
You want to break that up.

00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:54.178 align:middle line:84%
And so we have systems to
break the water molecules apart

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.314 align:middle line:84%
so that we end up with a
functionally structured water

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.150 align:middle line:84%
at a high pH, which
is energized.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:02.320 align:middle line:84%
We measured that, that when
you drink it, you feel better.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.454 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you're
feeling better

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
because you're managing
now the alkaline design

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.758 align:middle line:90%
of the -- of your body.

00:47:06.758 --> 00:47:09.727 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not having to work as
hard in order to get the --

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:14.065 align:middle line:84%
the much needed water into the
cells, it automatically goes in.

00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:17.869 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying to look for
water that has a 9.5 pH...

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:19.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Minimum 9.5 pH.

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:20.071 align:middle line:90%
>> ...or higher?

00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:21.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:23.408 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's not the normal
bottled water that we find

00:47:23.408 --> 00:47:24.409 align:middle line:90%
in the markets, right?

00:47:24.409 --> 00:47:25.843 align:middle line:84%
This is a specialized
type of water.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Well bottled water is
not functionally structured.

00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:29.914 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the bottled
water, they took it...

00:47:29.914 --> 00:47:31.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:32.016 align:middle line:84%
>> ...from the -- they
take it from the tap

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:33.618 align:middle line:90%
or they filter the water.

00:47:33.618 --> 00:47:35.687 align:middle line:84%
There are some companies
that are trying

00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:37.622 align:middle line:90%
to raise the pH chemically.

00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:40.525 align:middle line:84%
But, here again, you
want to be able to --

00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:42.694 align:middle line:90%
to create an alkaline water

00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:45.630 align:middle line:84%
by breaking the water
molecules apart and -- and I --

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:49.133 align:middle line:84%
I own three patents on a
systems that actually does that.

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:49.801 align:middle line:90%
>> That does that?

00:47:49.801 --> 00:47:51.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm-mm.

00:47:51.102 --> 00:47:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can find out more
about that on his website.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.638 align:middle line:90%
What about coconut water?

00:47:53.638 --> 00:47:55.606 align:middle line:90%
What's the pH of coconut water?

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:59.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Well coconut pH water
is actually identical

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.445 align:middle line:90%
to your own human plasma.

00:48:00.445 --> 00:48:01.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh it's...

00:48:01.446 --> 00:48:03.648 align:middle line:84%
>> It has a pH of
about 7.3 to 7.4.

00:48:03.648 --> 00:48:04.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh it does?

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:06.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. I remember that show.

00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.087 align:middle line:84%
Remember the guy that
got marooned on an island

00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:10.855 align:middle line:84%
and he was drinking
all the coconut water?

00:48:10.855 --> 00:48:12.023 align:middle line:90%
>> "Gilligan's Island"?

00:48:12.023 --> 00:48:13.424 align:middle line:84%
>> No. Well, "Gilligan's
Island" --

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:17.662 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of another one,
but yes coconut water is --

00:48:17.662 --> 00:48:21.599 align:middle line:84%
is actually perfectly
balanced at a 7.3 to 7.4.

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
You could actually use it to
replace fluid loss, you know,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.872 align:middle line:84%
through an IV if
that was necessary.

00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:28.906 align:middle line:90%
>> You're kidding?

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:32.276 align:middle line:84%
What about the juice
from green foods?

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:34.746 align:middle line:90%
How alkaline is green juice?

00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:36.147 align:middle line:90%
What is...

00:48:36.147 --> 00:48:37.482 align:middle line:84%
>> The green juice is going to
range, depending on what type

00:48:37.482 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:90%
of appliance that you use,

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.785 align:middle line:84%
if you're whipping it the
pH is going to drop down.

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:42.754 align:middle line:84%
If you're pressing it, the
pH is going to be higher.

00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:46.624 align:middle line:84%
So the range is going to be
anywhere from about 6.4 up to

00:48:46.624 --> 00:48:49.293 align:middle line:84%
about 7.4, depending
on your appliance.

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:48:50.461 --> 00:48:51.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether you're
pressing it or whipping it.

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:53.364 align:middle line:84%
If you're whipping it, you're
going to get more acid.

00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:55.299 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get more
physical disturbance.

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.768 align:middle line:84%
If you're pressing
it, you're going to --

00:48:56.768 --> 00:48:58.302 align:middle line:84%
you're going to keep
the juice intact

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.904 align:middle line:84%
without physically
disturbing it.

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:01.072 align:middle line:90%
>> And cold pressing it is --

00:49:01.072 --> 00:49:02.407 align:middle line:84%
actually we have
a video of this.

00:49:02.407 --> 00:49:03.941 align:middle line:84%
This is your wife
and she's making...

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:04.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:05.643 align:middle line:84%
>> ...something called
green milk.

00:49:05.643 --> 00:49:06.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:08.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is really,
really tasty looking.

00:49:08.046 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this
video and you'll know --

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.349 align:middle line:90%
this is what pressing is, right?

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:14.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Well she's using
a low-RPM juicer

00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:17.722 align:middle line:84%
that spins the juice very, very
slow rather than whipping it.

00:49:17.722 --> 00:49:18.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:49:18.923 --> 00:49:23.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay? And now -- she's
taking that juice, okay,

00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:25.296 align:middle line:84%
separated from all the
fiber and the stuff

00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:27.999 align:middle line:84%
that the body would eliminate
anywhere -- way, but this is -

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:29.267 align:middle line:90%
this is the blood of the plant.

00:49:29.267 --> 00:49:32.503 align:middle line:84%
This is what you want to
drink to build your own blood.

00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And then she's taking the
blood of an almond, okay?

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.008 align:middle line:90%
Because almonds...

00:49:37.008 --> 00:49:37.675 align:middle line:90%
>> [Inaudible].

00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.043 align:middle line:90%
>> ...do not digest.

00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:41.012 align:middle line:84%
However, if you chew it and
don't chew it to a liquid state,

00:49:41.012 --> 00:49:43.081 align:middle line:84%
it will come out the same
way that you swallowed it.

00:49:43.081 --> 00:49:44.649 align:middle line:84%
So you want it in
a liquid state.

00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:47.719 align:middle line:84%
She's combining that then
with the green drink,

00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:50.121 align:middle line:84%
creating what we
call green milk.

00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:51.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay. Take a look
at this video.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:50:00.798 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:08.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:50:08.673 --> 00:50:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Every morning at the pH
Miracle Center we serve fresh

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.778 align:middle line:90%
green juice.

00:50:13.778 --> 00:50:16.948 align:middle line:84%
We also serve fresh
silky almond milk.

00:50:16.948 --> 00:50:21.219 align:middle line:84%
And we mix those two and
we call it green milk

00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:25.089 align:middle line:84%
and it is a beautiful silky
way to get your greens down.

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:27.658 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so excited that you're
joining me this morning,

00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:31.896 align:middle line:84%
because I have found, in
my life, the first juicer

00:50:31.896 --> 00:50:36.901 align:middle line:84%
that can do both green juices
plus make nut and seed milks

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
without having to
strain the skins.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:43.307 align:middle line:84%
I know. Will wonders never
cease, right [laughter]?

00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:44.842 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited about
this juicer.

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:46.511 align:middle line:84%
I want to demonstrate
it for you this morning.

00:50:46.511 --> 00:50:48.746 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Power Grind Pro.

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:51.149 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very quiet juicer.

00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:53.851 align:middle line:84%
I can even talk over the
motor [background noise].

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:55.052 align:middle line:90%
So there it is.

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.622 align:middle line:84%

little bit to get the vegetables

really very easy to use.

Add a little more celery

to get the rest of
the celery down.

to strain the skins out.

So talk to me about
the fiber in the juice.

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.462 align:middle line:84%
Why do you not use the
fiber in the actual juice?

00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:26.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Well because the
body can't use fiber.

00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:30.301 align:middle line:84%
And -- and see digestion take
place in any place of our body,

00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:31.902 align:middle line:84%
other than where we break
it up with our teeth.

00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:33.971 align:middle line:84%
And when we eat a
lot of fibrous food,

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.174 align:middle line:84%
that just creates more
congestion and potential damage

00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:38.542 align:middle line:90%
in the small intestine.

00:54:38.542 --> 00:54:41.078 align:middle line:84%
We have to think of the small
intestine as the root system

00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:44.148 align:middle line:84%
and everything that goes in
there has to be at a pH of 8.4,

00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:45.583 align:middle line:90%
has to be in a liquid state.

00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:46.984 align:middle line:84%
If we have a lot
of fibrous foods,

00:54:46.984 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that's just creating more
congestion and constipation.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't it help elimination?

00:54:52.056 --> 00:54:54.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it doesn't because --
because what we eat should go

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:56.961 align:middle line:84%
in soft serve and it
should come out soft serve.

00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:58.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh. Okay.

00:54:58.229 --> 00:55:00.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay? So I kind of give
you a little graphic there

00:55:00.431 --> 00:55:01.031 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:02.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah. Yeah.

00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:05.036 align:middle line:84%
>> We -- we don't want
to be eating solid food.

00:55:05.036 --> 00:55:06.537 align:middle line:90%
If we are eating solid food,

00:55:06.537 --> 00:55:09.106 align:middle line:84%
we need to liquefy it
before we swallow it.

00:55:09.106 --> 00:55:12.076 align:middle line:84%
>> So you don't eat any
type of breads or nuts

00:55:12.076 --> 00:55:13.444 align:middle line:90%
or those types of foods?

00:55:13.444 --> 00:55:14.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:16.313 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
I don't enjoy them...

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:19.116 align:middle line:84%
>> ...or couldn't enjoy them,
but I know they're constipating

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:22.286 align:middle line:84%
because they -- the elimination
time in a lot of those foods,

00:55:22.286 --> 00:55:25.322 align:middle line:84%
particularly animal proteins
can be days and even weeks.

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:26.424 --> 00:55:27.892 align:middle line:84%
>> So no. I don't eat
any animal products.

00:55:27.892 --> 00:55:29.493 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat grains.

00:55:29.493 --> 00:55:32.163 align:middle line:84%
I eat a plant-based diet
that's focused mainly

00:55:32.163 --> 00:55:33.864 align:middle line:90%
on green foods and green drinks?

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:36.066 align:middle line:84%
>> And then how do you
get your carbohydrates?

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:37.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Well your body doesn't
run on carbohydrates.

00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:38.969 align:middle line:90%
It runs on electrons.

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:41.539 align:middle line:84%
So remember the pictures
with all the energy?

00:55:41.539 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:90%
I eat for life force energy.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.942 align:middle line:90%
So I feed on the sun.

00:55:44.942 --> 00:55:49.013 align:middle line:84%
I feed on foods that absorb
sun that are high chlorophyll

00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:50.648 align:middle line:90%
and that light, which is held

00:55:50.648 --> 00:55:53.617 align:middle line:84%
within the chlorophyll
molecule is then released

00:55:53.617 --> 00:55:56.287 align:middle line:84%
in our own bodies and
this is how we get energy.

00:55:56.287 --> 00:55:57.254 align:middle line:90%
>> My goodness.

00:55:57.254 --> 00:55:58.422 align:middle line:84%
No. I've never heard
of that before.

00:55:58.422 --> 00:55:59.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:00.658 align:middle line:90%
>> But now I have [laughter].

00:56:00.658 --> 00:56:03.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the chlorophyll molecule,
its center atom is magnesium.

00:56:03.127 --> 00:56:06.197 align:middle line:84%
It acts as an electromagnetic
[inaudible] to hold light.

00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:09.133 align:middle line:90%
See and when the sun disappears,

00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:12.403 align:middle line:84%
greens start going
yellow and brown.

00:56:12.403 --> 00:56:14.705 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because it's
not holding onto the light.

00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:16.307 align:middle line:90%
And so the leaves fall off.

00:56:16.307 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But when there is light that the
tree -- the plant can absorb,

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:22.079 align:middle line:90%
then it stays green and...

00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:23.814 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the brain
needing carbohydrates,

00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:25.449 align:middle line:84%
the body needing
carbohydrates for fuel?

00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:27.117 align:middle line:84%
>> The body -- the body
doesn't run on carbohydrates.

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.118 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't run on protein.

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't run on fat.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.054 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no carbohydrates
in the cells?

00:56:30.054 --> 00:56:31.155 align:middle line:90%
>> It runs on electrical energy.

00:56:31.155 --> 00:56:33.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any
carbohydrates in the cells?

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.559 align:middle line:84%
>> No. The cells,
you know, they --

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:36.861 align:middle line:90%
they talk about a Krebs cycle,

00:56:36.861 --> 00:56:39.029 align:middle line:84%
but that was based
upon fermentation.

00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:42.433 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about within that
-- that cycle, which is acrid,

00:56:42.433 --> 00:56:44.835 align:middle line:90%
is the electron transport chain.

00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:46.270 align:middle line:90%
That's where energy's derived.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.873 align:middle line:84%
Not in ATP, but in
that electron.

00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:50.574 align:middle line:90%
This is where life force is.

00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:55.079 align:middle line:84%
We are electrical beings having
a physical experience not

00:56:55.079 --> 00:56:57.147 align:middle line:84%
physical beings having
electrical experience.

00:56:57.147 --> 00:57:01.285 align:middle line:84%
So we eat for energy, not for
calories, not for protein,

00:57:01.285 --> 00:57:03.687 align:middle line:84%
not for fats, and
surely not carbohydrates.

00:57:03.687 --> 00:57:07.024 align:middle line:84%
In fact, carbohydrates are
high in sugars generally,

00:57:07.024 --> 00:57:10.361 align:middle line:84%
complex carbohydrates, and sugar
is a metabolic waste product

00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:11.695 align:middle line:90%
that makes us sick.

00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:13.898 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies don't
even run on sugar.

00:57:13.898 --> 00:57:15.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. Well that
is quick burning.

Out of that 40 acres, 30 of
the acres we grow avocado.

like grapefruits and
persimmon and pomegranate,

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:41.392 align:middle line:84%
