00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of you know someone
whose life has been

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%
touched by a child with autism.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:84%
In real numbers we're
looking at 1 in 88

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:90%
children in the United States.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And 1 in 64 in the
United Kingdom.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
Only two decades ago it
was virtually unheard of.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
So what's happening?

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Suzy Miller would tell
us that what's happening

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:10%
is more than what most
of us can comprehend.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
These children, she says,
are gateways to the future.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And Suzy's with us here
in the studio today.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
in reading your book,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you must have so many
people, especially

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
those who are in connection
with autistic children, who

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
are in tears within the
first 20 pages of your book,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:84%
which is called Awesomism--
as a replacement for autism.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And for good reason.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a startling
story I think for many of you.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And before we get into the
"awesomism" of these children,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
let's start out
with your own story.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you were a
speech pathologist.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have any
particular interest

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
in autism in the beginning.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
I went into speech
pathology and had

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:10%
a career for about 20--
25 years as a speech

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:10%
language pathologist.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:10%
But the last 10 of that really
became very focused on autism

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:10%
because I had some pretty
significant experiences with

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:10%
children diagnosed with autism.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:10%
And it kind of took me in a
whole brand new direction.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that almost seems-- you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and I have talked off
camera-- it was almost

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:90%
as though it was destined.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you have now begun
to play an incredible role.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Almost as a surrogate
between the two worlds.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Between autistic
children who were

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate with you in
very unconventional ways-- now.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning though
it took you by surprise.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And your entire life was
changed, almost in a day,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
when a little boy walked into
your office-- named Riley.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the story.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And don't leave anything out
because I love this story.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually I was a pediatric
speech language pathologist.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a private practice-- given
a new child on my case load,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with autism--
and had really not seen

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
very many children diagnosed
with autism at that point,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:90%
And I thought-- challenge.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
You know-- we'll
see what we can do.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went to this
child's daycare center.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into
the daycare center

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
there is this little
cherub of a boy.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
You know-- brown
hair, bowl haircut,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:90%
with the big brown eyes.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:90%
He was gorgeous.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And his daycare provider
introduced me to him.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But before that
introduction-- well, he

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
introduced me by saying,
this is Riley-- over there.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And Riley was marching back
and forth in the kitchen

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and he was saying,
it's the millennium!

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:90%
It's 1999.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.221 align:middle line:84%
It's surprising you could say
"millennium" at four years old.

00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
-He could.
-I mean seriously.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of his kind
of rote communication too.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
He had heard that somewhere.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- but that
kind of caught me by guard.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the millennium.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:90%
It's 1999.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Why does a
four-year-old say that?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Then he walked up
to me and he made

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
direct eye contact
with me, which

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
now I know is-- kids don't do
that, diagnosed with autism.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and he said, master.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And when he said "master"
there was something visceral

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:90%
that happened inside of me.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that word
was in that moment

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
really opened up
something within me

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
existed myself.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And you hear a word like that--
I'm a pediatric speech language

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
pathologist, I'm very left
brained at that point,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
seeing the world
through those eyes.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So I felt a visceral response.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really
understand what that

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
actually meant at that moment.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the daycare
provider said,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
you know let's go to
the back of the house.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And here's a room where you
can see this child in privacy.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.393 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked
back and-- you know,

00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
a little four-year-old
boy diagnosed with autism.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
He did not want to be in
that room in that moment.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:84%
And so-- brought
him in the room.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
so vividly thinking,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know what to do
with this kid in this moment.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So I slid myself down
the door and I was just

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:90%
sitting in front of the door.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.023 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm just
going to give him a little bit

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:90%
of time to acclimate to me.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know why I thought

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
that that would work either.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there
for a few minutes.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then all of sudden I
was watching him move around

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
the room and I saw
something floating

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
above his physical body.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And above this physical body,
almost up and to the right,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
there was an image
of him that was

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
identical to his
physicality-- but it was

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:90%
literally made out of light.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, same shape,
same size, same everything.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the only difference
was there was a little tail

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of energy that came
off of one of his feet

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and came down into
the physical aspects--

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
physicality of his body
and touched into his heart.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in the
moment seeing that

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and thinking-- you know to
myself, not out loud-- what

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:90%
the heck is that?

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And the next moment is
probably the moment that most

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:90%
significantly changed my life.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Because in that moment I
heard, that's my light body.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You're here to help me
integrate my light body

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:90%
into my physical body.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.631 align:middle line:84%
Now you were hearing
this telepathically?

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Which I-- to me in that
moment, through the speech

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
pathologist vantage point, I was
hearing something in my head.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And something wasn't good.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason
in that moment also

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
how-- I didn't know

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
that I knew how to do that.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Or why he had asked
me to do that.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But I did have this strange
sensation in that very moment

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:90%
that my life had just changed.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean it just-- I
remember getting in the car

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%
after seeing him.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And we were together
for an hour.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
interesting is

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
that hour felt like 15 minutes.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Something just happened
to time as well

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
while we were there, which
I know more about now

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:90%
than I did that moment.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.703 align:middle line:84%
But I remember getting out into
my car and just-- you know,

00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:90%
you shut the door.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And sitting there in my car and
thinking-- at that moment I did

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
say out loud-- my
life has just changed.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And it had.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And now that you
know what you know

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
it seems pretty
obvious that his being

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
had a direct impact on you.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And opened up your
facility for being

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
able to both see and hear into
these other dimensional fields.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed many,
many people through the years.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
have gone through this

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
usually have one kind of
unexpected and startling moment

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:90%
where this occurs.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.321 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it is
facilitated by something else.

00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yeah.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I always say that he was
the lock that went in the key.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it took one moment in
time for him to turn that.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And there was an immense
unwinding of my awareness

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:90%
from that moment forward.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But to give yourself a little
credit as well, when you were

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
very young you were intuitive.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean you weren't
necessarily seeing

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
things or hearing
telepathic communications,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:90%
but you just knew things.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You were a sensitive-- I
mean it would have to be.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise why would you
be in this situation

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
right now if there
weren't something

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:90%
that were there to work with?

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And you were able
to-- you just knew.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You knew things
that we're coming

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
up when you were a little
kid and it was disconcerting.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Little fun things like
telling my mother--

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
who was interested in who
else's husband at bridge games.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
-Ha ha.
-Yeah,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.405 align:middle line:90%
At bridge games!

00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:01.205 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, not a good thing.

00:08:01.205 --> 00:08:03.011 align:middle line:84%
This is not information
you wanted to make public.

00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.661 align:middle line:84%
No.
Bless her heart.

00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to add
that bit that you yourself

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
are open enough, even
though you considered

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
yourself academic and left
brained at this point.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
to work with there.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.719 align:middle line:90%
There was.

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
OK so now you've
gotten in the car,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you've heard that
your life has changed,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and now you're going through
the journey of helping

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:90%
him with this request.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Or basically, this
understanding you're

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
going to help them
integrate into the body.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
He actually was
very direct with me.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
He would come to
me through dreams.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
He would come to me through
what I now know as bilocation.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I would literally
see that light body

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
or see that lighter version of
him with me at various times.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And he would offer
me suggestions on how

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
to support that integration.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
That happened both when
I was physically with him

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and when I was at home
doing other things.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
So he kept showing up.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
He not only was the person that
turned that-- or the energy--

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
that turned that key.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But he also was masterful
in his own right

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
so that he was able to
lead me step by step.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the more telepathic I
became through this process,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the more I could simply
ask him direct questions

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and he would respond to those
questions-- which is pretty

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
much where the book came from.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.251 align:middle line:84%
So he's guided you
through the process--

00:09:33.251 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Every step in it.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
--of helping him heal
his own situation.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And understand this
for many, many more

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that you-- I mean you've worked
another decade with these kids.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yeah.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happened

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and the various tools that
were utilized to help integrate

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:90%
him into his physical body.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.891 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an
issue for all of them.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Pretty Much.
-Right.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:84%
What I will say ahead of time
is, what I would use today

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit different
than what I would've

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:90%
used 13, 14 years ago with him.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But basically what
he would ask me to do

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
is to work with
him with frequency.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
So color was important.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Sound was important.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Touch was also important,
but touch from the standpoint

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So making a physical
connection based on frequency.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, we might
be in that same room

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:90%
with the door closed again.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And he would telepathically
tell me to touch his shoulders,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
or to put my hand on his heart,
or to put his hand on my heart.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we would just go
through that step by step.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is it
facilitated in me my ability

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
to see energy as well.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if I would
touch his shoulders

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I could watch his light body
come into the physical body.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I would touch his
feet I could see that energy

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
start to move down the legs.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I could also watch when--
after a period of time--

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
where things were
getting integrated.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Not just light into physicality
but light into cells, light

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%
into systems of the body.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So it just progressively moved.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
most interesting times

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
for me was when he was
talking about using

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the sound frequencies to
support his integration.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember having
a dream one night,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was so clear-- bring,
bring tuning forks tomorrow.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear it
like a child's voice.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Bring tuning forks tomorrow.
OK.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go scout
out some tuning forks

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
and I brought them with me.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And he would show them
to me-- touch them.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would just hit them
and give them to him.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know necessarily what
we're going to do with them.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And he got to the
point where he found

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:90%
a couple that he really liked.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would hit
them simultaneously

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and he would listen to them.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when he heard them-- for
anybody who has seen children

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with
autism, very much they

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
look like they're
not behind their eyes

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
or they're not present
in their physicality--

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
when these tones would come
into play, there he was.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And eyes lit up,
attention was with me.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:90%
He would engage with you?

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
He would make
direct eye contact.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear-- literally
he was directing me.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.754 align:middle line:90%
Like, a little bit to the left.

00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:90%
A little bit to the right.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And so we did that for a while.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point he said
to me telepathically, I want you

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:90%
to do that with your mouth. .

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had no-- again,
how do you make tuning

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:90%
fork sounds with your mouth?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make sense.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't understand
is-- I tried it, because he

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:90%
asked, and I could do it.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what we would create
is almost like this war

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:90%
bowl of two frequencies.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would ask me to keep
that going until the two sounds

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.426 align:middle line:90%
became one.

00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And as they became one the
same thing would happen--

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%
has eye contact, and
the lights were on,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and the presence was there.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So the sound part was really
kind of a fun training.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And you were at the
same time watching him

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and his physical process
as this was going on.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.031 align:middle line:84%
So you could see whether
he was starting to occupy--

00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Himself.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.821 align:middle line:84%
The light was
occupying himself.

00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes absolutely.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
He also did that
with color, which

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
was really fascinating to
me from-- almost from a more

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:90%
cognitive standpoint.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he asked me at
one point to bring color.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only
directive, just bring color.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And my kids were going to the
Waldorf School at the time

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.331 align:middle line:84%
so we had this big silks,
with brightly colored silks,

00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:01.041 align:middle line:84%
My son went there.
I loved the silks.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
They're amazing.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So I gathered up
a bunch of those

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and I just brought them with
me to the daycare center.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And I just would lay them out.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It was very much
trial and error.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And he would pick the color.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the very
first time it was red.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I also, that day, was kind
of pretending to be a speech

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:90%
pathologist again as well.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because every now
and again I thought,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, just go back to
what you know how to do.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And just like make some--
create some sanity here.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But it was wonderful because
I had a deck of cards,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
it was just categories
of animals and things

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that speech pathologist do.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.557 align:middle line:84%
And it was brilliant because
he showed me the red silk, what

00:14:47.557 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:90%
do you want me to do with this?

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear in my
head, put it over us.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like make
a tent and put it over us.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I could see while the red
was over us that he was doing

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:90%
something with that color.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
His energy was doing-- it
was absorbing that color

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:90%
or doing something with it.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm curious person so
we would put it over again.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
let's-- I just wanted

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the color
because I could see

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
that it was doing something.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So I grabbed the
cards and I started

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:90%
showing him these cards.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the
color he would say,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
oh, giraffe, cow, pig, dog.
-No problem.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK, interesting.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would put the cards
away, take that color off,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd bring the cards
back-- nothing.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
really interesting.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So then what I
noticed over time is

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that he would associate certain
colors with certain categories.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%
So the red became the animals.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:90%
And the blue became the toys.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And the green became the food.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so as long as he was--
and then it got to the point

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
where I could simply
intend, in my own awareness,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I could intend red and
then he could do it.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I can intend blue
and he could do it.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was on a crash course of,
what actually does facilitate

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:90%
the growth of these kids?

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And how do they work?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.674 align:middle line:84%
-So it was pure frequency.
-Pure frequency.

00:16:24.674 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean first of
all, what you were

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:84%
looking at in his
other dimensional self

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:90%
is pure frequency.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.771 align:middle line:84%
Our other dimensional
aspect is pure frequency.

00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
That we don't-- most
people don't understand

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that or connect
directly with ourselves.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They're just showing up
as who they truly are.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And now we're understanding
through many modalities

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of science that
the future is going

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:90%
to be frequency based healing.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Already sound healing,
color healing,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is at the base of
a lot of therapies.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.661 align:middle line:84%
Very sophisticated technologies,
not just ancient technologies.

00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So he was taking you
through the understanding

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
really of multi-dimensionality
it sounds like.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Very much so.
Yeah.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Much more so than--
much more so than I

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
could have ever known
at the time too.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have experiences

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
like that and you're--
I was a huge student.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I was as much a student as
anything at that moment.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you're learning,
and your integrating,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
and you're becoming
aware yourself of things

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't aware of just
a month ago or a week ago.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time-- you
know now when I look back I go,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.231 align:middle line:84%
oh, now I understand
what that was about.

00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.114 align:middle line:84%
But you know it takes a
little bit of integration time

00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
before you figure out
what those things are.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Right.
This was all new to you.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.309 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Well a few years ago I
interviewed a man named

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Ron Davis, who is autistic.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He explained that
there was a wave

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of autistic people coming in.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.201 align:middle line:84%
And so this would have been
back in-- I guess the '30s.

00:17:51.201 --> 00:17:52.731 align:middle line:84%
Yep.
How interesting.

00:17:52.731 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
He said that was the first wave
of the new beings coming in.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And that they were
coming in for purpose.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
He did not speak till
he was 17 years old.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
His life-- his
mother did not want

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:90%
him to be institutionalized.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
They lived in Texas.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.721 align:middle line:84%
The father considered
him "a retard."

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Poor kid.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And he used to beat
him up regularly.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the poor little kid was
put in a corner in a classroom

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
with a little scarf over his
head signifying a dunce cap.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:90%
And left there.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what he did
for years and years.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately he did speak.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And once he spoke,
what they found out

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
was inside of him
was incredible.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, you cannot separate
me from mathematics.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
He was helping debug-- and
I think it was Rockwell,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
was the military
contractor at the time

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
working on the Polaris
missile: system.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh.
Wow.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
He was helping them
only two years in

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to uttering his first word.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Working with debugging
this kind of technology.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you couldn't separate
him from the understanding

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:90%
of all of this.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet he spoke to us about
when he was a little child what

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:90%
happens to these little kids.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to roll
tape in just a second here.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
About what happens
because these kids

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
don't need to crawl, and touch,
and reach out to their world.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And let's take a look

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:10%
You look at the early
childhood development books

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:10%
that most expectant
mothers will look at,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:10%
and they read about what they
can expect from their child.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But let's take
just one of these.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
An individual who is exploring
the environment mentally

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
will either be very
motivated to become mobile.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're very
motivated now to get out there

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and not just
explore it mentally,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
but to get their hands on
it, to get it in their mouth,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:90%
to explore it physically.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So a person like this
is going to be very

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:90%
motivated to control movement.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So they will start
crawling very early.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they're
supposed to start crawling,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
they're already up
and running around.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
the person who has already

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:90%
explored it.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They already know where
it is and what it is.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to be mobile.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So they aren't motivated
to become mobile.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So the time to start
crawling comes and goes.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
It's time for them
to start walking

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're still not even
yet crawling very well.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks
that there is

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with the child.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's wrong
is that they're not motivated.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I find that
absolutely fascinating.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:90%
They're not motivated.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.156 align:middle line:84%
And he explained in other
parts of the interview

00:20:34.156 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that they're already aware of--
he's aware of living in three

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
dimensions at all times.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
He's aware of himself
in three dimensions.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as a little child
you've gone around the corner,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
you've already explored
it, you've come back,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
you don't need to budge.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Well not only that,
this population

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
knows one-ness like no other.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the ability to
sense their environment,

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to not even have
to have gone to it,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
but to know it because
they're one with it.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.581 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a little
frightening for parents

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Because there is that-- you
want that typical development.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet these children are so
well developed in so many areas

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that it's-- it's an
interesting, it's an interesting

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
dilemma for the parents.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet when we understand
how they're functioning,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
actually doing, their

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
interconnectedness
with all things--

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which the
parents themselves-- it

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
really becomes pretty
amazing to watch these kids

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:90%
and watch them grow.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit later on we're
going to talk about the dance

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:90%
between them and their parents.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a
really critical part.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And also I just wanted you
to really tell the Riley

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:90%
story in its completion.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Because this is significantly a
part of everybody else's story

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:90%
that you met.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the story of most of
the autistic children you've

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:90%
met, to one degree or another.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
This multi-dimensionality,
this inability

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.821 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring their light
body into their physical body.

00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go to
epilogue of that story,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
which is when it got to the
point where he could write.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And on page 16 in your
book, I wrote this down.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I was just, I just-- I
was just gob smacked,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:90%
as they say in Britain.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:90%
That this is what he wrote.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.481 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote-- now this
is a year or so in, right?

00:22:32.481 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-He's integrated now.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
He still shows some
autistic tendencies, right?

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's not like he's
totally like any other kid.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Explain what he
actually functioned

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:84%
like before I get
into this part.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
He was-- he had some
intermittent language.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But more like, it's
the millennium.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:90%
It's 1999.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Kind of wrote things
that he had heard

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes he could apply
to a situation that made sense.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But more often than not
his speech was very broken.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
His telepathy was great but the
speech part was very broken.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Not a whole-- there
was not writing that I

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
knew of anyway prior to this.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting is when
we went through this process

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
together it was his process and
it was also my process as well.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there were all kinds of
skill sets that I had to learn.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:90%
He was your teacher.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.369 align:middle line:84%
He was my teacher.
Yeah.

00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And he opened it up to a lot
of other teachers as well that

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
supported me throughout
that process.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding
that piece, and using

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
all that had been offered
throughout that year,

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
culminated in me doing an
energy session for him.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to do
it on my birthday,

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:84%
as a gift to myself I
think more than anything.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But all that I had learned and
just applying it on his behalf.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:90%
And I did apply it.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And went to see him
physically the next day.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's when this came about.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Then he wrote this
thing that would seem odd

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:90%
but it's interesting.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I read it I
knew what he was saying.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And he writes more than this,
he said "erasable your asable."

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And said "erasable."

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And said "erasable." this
is still-- now he's only five

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:90%
at this time, right?

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote some other things.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean?

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Because you asked him.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I asked him.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It meant that I was able
to see his energy clearly.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
To interface with his energy
but not leave anything of myself

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:90%
in the mix.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to interact
with him in that way.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:84%
To strengthen his
integration but not

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:90%
impede it with my own stuff.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And as he went deeper in
he wrote a few more things.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the end he wrote
that he loved you.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.094 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:59.094 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely beautiful story.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And now how did the parents--
I don't mean to make you teary.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
-No that's OK.
-It's a very emotional.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
It hit's me every time.
It's really interesting.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so how did his -- by
this time, how were his

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.416 align:middle line:90%
parents interacting with him?

00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:90%
How had their lives changed?

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Well it was interesting
because this was

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:90%
my first go-around with this.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so he wasn't
saying a whole lot.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I actually would say
to Riley very frequently,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.634 align:middle line:84%
can I say something
to your mother?

00:25:28.634 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Can I say something
to your father?

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:90%
They were lovely people.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And he would say,
not yet, not yet.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he would ask--
you know I would

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:90%
ask him tons of questions.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I was finding out
all kinds of things.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And in my speech pathology way
what I would very often say

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, I find it's interesting
that he sleeps at the end

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:90%
of your bed at night.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And yeah she would tell me a
little bit more about that.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I would say something
to the effect that, you know,

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:84%
well sometimes kids
do that so they

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:90%
can feel more connected to you.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So you really used
a lot of subtlety

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
at this point in working
with his parents.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately he told
you that-- and we're

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
going to come back in just a
minute after a little break--

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
ultimately he told you,
yes, you can tell them.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful breakthrough.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well when we come back
in just a little bit

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about these
children acting as mirrors,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, for their parents--
which is a very important

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.607 align:middle line:90%
piece to this picture.

00:26:21.607 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a minute.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.604 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:25.604 --> 00:26:40.351 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back.
I'm here with Suzy Miller.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times with parents
of autistic children

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is-- of course there's
frustration and sometimes

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.721 align:middle line:84%
anger-- but there's
a lot of guilt.

00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow they feel
that they made a bad decision.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:84%
That the mother
ate something bad--

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
you know while the child
was in utero or something.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.641 align:middle line:84%
But please straighten
us out on this.

00:27:01.641 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's interesting.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when I look at
parents of children diagnosed

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
with autism I look at a
population that, number one,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.595 align:middle line:84%
has really chosen to
fast track themselves.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:10%
You know-- spiritually.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And create an awareness
within themselves

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:10%
that they may not have had
the opportunity to have

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:10%
if they didn't have
this particular child.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:10%
I also see that, from
an energetic standpoint,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:10%
that there is so much
guilt because parents will

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:10%
be told those kinds of things.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting a
little bit better

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
but-- you know the
mother especially

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
was identified as the bad one.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean how could you not
go into a state of guilt

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
if you are perceived
in that way?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, truly, when people--
when parents, especially

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:84%
mothers, especially understand
what it takes energetically,

00:27:53.610 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally to give birth
to a child that is functioning

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:84%
in this way, they really can--
there's almost a pride that

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:90%
can come up from it as well.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The more you understand
about who they

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
actually gave birth
to it becomes really

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:90%
a whole different ball game.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The other thing,
it doesn't negate

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the challenges that take
place for them on a day in,

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:90%
day out basis.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I look at the
energy of these individuals

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I really have never seen a
population that has chosen

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:90%
to fast track themselves.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about the
statistic of 1 in 88 families.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Compared to what
two decades ago?

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh Yeah.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:90%
1 in hundreds, thousands?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about it
that way-- I mean I kind of say,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
wow, there's 1 in 88
families out there

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that is having this
pretty amazing experience

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:90%
or amazing opportunity.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Provided that they have the
opportunity to hear some

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.799 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of information.
-Exactly.

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're saying
is that you have a higher

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:84%
dimensional being
that has decided

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.665 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate into this family.

00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Or attempting.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And attempting to
incarnate into this family.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:90%
As yes-- attempting.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And with that it
brings all of those

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:90%
beautiful high frequencies.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
All the challenges, but
these high frequencies.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Which are really levels
of subtle information

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that are constantly being
exchanged between the members

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:90%
of the family.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The dance of energy in these
families is just profound.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in all
families you know.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But in this
particular situation,

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
where you have somebody who
is so energetically sensitive

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
among the individuals
in this household,

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
there really becomes
this energetic dance.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very subtle dance,
which-- and we all know

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
that when we have very subtle
levels of awareness our ability

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:90%
to grow is huge.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
The more subtle we can
understand ourselves,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
the more we grow.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening day in
and day out in these families.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And these kids are
acting as mirrors.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
They are providing
the service of being

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
a mirror to what's going
on around them emotionally.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not so
attached physically.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And on a mental plane they're
operating far above that plane

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:90%
on many levels.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So that the average engagement
with our repetitive minds

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.251 align:middle line:84%
isn't where they shine.
Right?

00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Right.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.901 align:middle line:84%
But emotionally these
people are switched on.

00:30:24.901 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Sensitive.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Often you call it a sixth sense,
sensing into the future even.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that mirroring dynamic

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when
kids are acting out,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- because of
the energetic frequency

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that these kids actually are--
one of the first places they

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
can interface as their
attempting to integrate

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is, like you said, with
that emotional body.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when they are
in a family environment

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:84%
they're not really
interested in what's going

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.944 align:middle line:90%
on in the physical environment.

00:30:57.944 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
interested in what

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:90%
you have to say either.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that's more
the mental domain.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:90%
But they do feel you.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And when they feel they have a
tendency of not having any way

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:90%
of expressing that.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So they mirror it,
they act it out.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And so very often
I'll say to parents,

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
you know if you're frustrated,
say you're frustrated.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Allow your words and you're
feeling to go together.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes a lot
more sense for these kids

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:84%
then if you say, mommy's
happy-- everything's fine.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And yet you're not.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.495 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.495 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And when parents use that kind
of the old paradigm parenting

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
model of-- we're supposed
to be the tough ones,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and know all these things,
and be the teachers.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%
When they use that model
what will very often happen

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is the child will-- this
is the child that's banging

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:90%
their head up against the wall.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And the parent-- why
is this child banging

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:90%
their head up against the wall?

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I will ask the child
telepathically about that

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
the child will say,
ask if she's banging

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.180 align:middle line:90%
her head up against the wall?

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Ask if there is a
level of frustration

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that's causing her to want
to kind of pull her hair out.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
simply acknowledging that

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that can
really change the energy.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And you also have a population
who is very keyed into very

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
subtle energetic changes.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is one of
the most profound pieces.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when-- for a parent who
knows very little about energy,

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and you make the suggestion--
sometimes they're so frustrated

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:90%
they'll try it just to see.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, it
does change something.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And it changes it on
a dime, in the moment.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a sudden this
child has been bombarded

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:90%
with all of these energies.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Feeling them, acting them
out, trying desperately

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:84%
to show the family kind of what
the emotional energy is like.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.091 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden when the
emotional energy changes so

00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:84%
do they.
-They change too.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.671 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
child that kept the lists.

00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
-The lists.
-I love the lists story.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So actually there is a
parent-- she's actually

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the certified
practitioners--

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and she is a very
A-type personality.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I very much like her for that.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And she always
was keeping lists.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And so she-- and in her
head mentally it was,

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:90%
my list, where's my list?

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do this next.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do that next.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And her son, who's a little
bit older, was verbal

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and kind of had a repetitive
verbal nature to his language

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And he would say things
like, my list, my list.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I gotta find my list.
What's next?

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he would kind
of go through this.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden she was
lying in bed one morning

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and she thought, oh my
gosh, it's not his list.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Because she was-- you know you
get frustrated with the kids

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.340 align:middle line:90%
as far as, what's coming next?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:90%
And why are they doing that?

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.996 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden she was
like, oh, it's not his list.

00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:90%
That goes on in my own head.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
That's my own mental processing.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
And the minute she thought
that this young man

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:84%
came into her bedroom and laid
down the list on her table--

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
or in her bed, and turned
around and walked away.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like. all
done with the list.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The empathy that's
going on there.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting thing
too because a lot of people

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:84%
will say that children diagnosed
with autism don't have empathy.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they don't have the
ability to understand

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:90%
emotion in other people.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the furthest thing from
the truth in a lot of ways.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're
picking it up-- picking it up

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
on such a subtle
level that they're

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
acting it out long before
the parents says I'm mad.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm understanding this.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
necessarily feel that.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They're sensing it far
in advance of any kind

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:90%
of physical manifestation.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we can't have
this conversation

00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
without talking about
vaccinations, toxins, gut

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
flora-- which is really
now factoring into this

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of the research.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying it's
more complex than that.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say it
is being acknowledged.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
just in the last--

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:84%
very recently-- maybe
in last week or two,

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:84%
an Italian court favored
the client, the petitioner,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:84%
which was a little family
of a little boy who

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:90%
had had received his vaccines.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And after the
vaccination his entire

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:84%
being started breaking
down and then he

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.580 align:middle line:84%
became-- he started
displaying autistic symptoms.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
now-- at least one court,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's more
than one court case.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:90%
There are.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the
news but they're there.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.779 align:middle line:84%
They are not in the news but
there are other court cases

00:35:41.779 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
where they're now
siding with the families

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and not with the FDA.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that part and how

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.181 align:middle line:84%
toxins and these vaccines are
interfacing with the subject.

00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an individual
who is being born and holding

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:84%
a very high
vibrational frequency,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're attempting
to make that integration

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:84%
into the physical body,
the physical body plays--

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration of
the physical body--

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
plays a role in the
ability to integrate.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like pouring
pristine water into mud.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.740 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work very well.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in this case when a
child is attempting to integrate

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and vaccines are in
the body, it's a toxic.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean there's no way around it.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just toxic.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I've asked
the kids about it--

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I've asked not only Riley,
but several kids about that

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
interesting subject to me

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:84%
as well-- he said that it's not
only the actual chemicals that

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
go into the vaccine
that create a reaction

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
but it is the consciousness with
which they're created as well.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Makes perfect sense.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when-- and I've asked
several children also--

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
is this something that was
a precursor to your autism?

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten a lot of
children who have said yes.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.810 align:middle line:90%
That that was a precursor.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I've also had children who say--
who have not been vaccinated--

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and when I ask them about
their situations a lot

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of times they'll say, there are
a lot of levels of toxicity.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:84%
There is physical
toxicity that can

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.990 align:middle line:84%
come from foods,
and from chemicals,

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of things.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:90%
There's also mental toxicity.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Where you have constant,
heavy, negative repetitions

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:90%
going on in the household.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:90%
There's also emotional toxicity.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I had one little boy who kind
of checked out, if you will,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:84%
after a pretty significant
death in their family.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was very emotional.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
This child is attempting to
integrate into physicality,

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and of course nobody
knows that that's

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:90%
what he's attempting to do.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the emotional
energy of that

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
he chooses to move out and
away from the physical body

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:90%
for a time being.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
interesting-- that's

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:90%
an important piece as well.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
these children will

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:90%
move in and out of physicality.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
gentleman that we

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:84%
heard just a little while ago,
he didn't talk until he was 17.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't integrated in the body
maybe enough to be able to have

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.360 align:middle line:90%
that kind of language.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:84%
This population does
that all the time.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But what ends up happening is
the moment the child starts

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.300 align:middle line:90%
moving out we go into fear.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We go into, oh my
gosh, he's not present.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, what's
happening to him?

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Get the doctor.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Get the nurse.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Get the educator.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Figure out what the
heck's going on.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
emotional energy has them

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
keep going the other direction.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not until we really move
back into an awareness of who

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
we really are, expressing
ourselves as fully as we

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
possibly can-- as they're
educators, as their therapist,

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
as their parents-- all of a
sudden they feel that energy.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.134 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a magnet.

00:39:08.134 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Then they start coming in.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And you told me something off
camera, which was-- someone

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:84%
was asking you
about your thoughts

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:84%
on drugging autistic children
and children's with ADD.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.434 align:middle line:84%
And you came back with a snappy,
unexpected, little response.

00:39:22.434 --> 00:39:23.200 align:middle line:90%
You surprised yourself.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect it.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you said.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Well in all honesty, if we
were going to drug somebody,

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.850 align:middle line:84%
if we were going to support
somebody with pharmaceuticals--

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
let's put it that way-- I
would support the parent.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and the reason
I say that is, number one,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the energy field of these
children is very susceptible.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It's very open, it's
very sensitive--

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:90%
extremely sensitive.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so if something-- hopefully
something herbal and not

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical-- but
if something could

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.930 align:middle line:90%
be given to the parent to--

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:90%
To calm them down.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.960 align:middle line:90%
To calm them down.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.800 align:middle line:84%
To reduce that
stress there would

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.687 align:middle line:84%
be a mirroring effect and the
child would benefit from that.

00:40:03.687 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And so would the parents.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was very
interesting to bring up.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll be as delicate as we can.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about ADD.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.334 align:middle line:84%
Well I was going to
ask you something

00:40:12.334 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if we
really need to go there.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is--
oftentimes people divide

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:84%
the world of autistic
children into high function

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:90%
and low function.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes the high
function are really brilliant,

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.340 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes even savants.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But are you saying whether it's
that or whether it's someone

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't appear
to be displaying

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:84%
any noticeable talents
and skills-- it's

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:90%
all the same process?

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all the same process
as far as my vantage point.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's varying degrees
of integration.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:90%
So how integrated are they?

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Where are they
integrated in the body?

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And where they not integrated?

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.391 align:middle line:84%
And that speaks very clearly as
to some of the characteristics

00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:84%
that are described.
-OK.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the ADD thing.
-OK.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote in your book
that-- I think it was back

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.050 align:middle line:84%
in 2001, and one
particular classroom that

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
was being looked at--
33% of the children

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.660 align:middle line:90%
where diagnosed as being ADD.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.921 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- the first
thing, drug them.

00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.331 align:middle line:84%
Now that was 2000-- that
was now 11 years ago.

00:41:11.331 --> 00:41:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So that number must have
increased since then.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
it would be now?

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it would be now.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But what's
interesting about ADD,

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
ADHD-- for me-- is
energetically watching it.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They were the
precursors to autism.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like ADD
and ADHD where the diagnosis

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:90%
of the decade in some ways.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of kids
that were coming in that we're

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
having some
challenges in that way

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.340 align:middle line:84%
because they were very
also energetically

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, more integrated
into the physical body.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But you know I
call ADD "attention

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:90%
in different dimensions."

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.020 align:middle line:84%
You know and ADHD, attention
in different dimensions

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.310 align:middle line:90%
at hyper-speed, basically.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they're already
focusing on something else.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it energetically,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that frequency had to build.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have a huge
population of ADD, ADHD.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden--
like the gentlemen

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
we saw-- some individuals
30 years ago coming in

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.240 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with autism.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.690 align:middle line:90%
A spattering here and there.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But you get to like 1990, 1995
and you've got a huge influx

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:90%
of kids coming in.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where masses of these
children start coming in.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But it all had to be
built energetically.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, the
fact that they're here

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:90%
is just mind blowing.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Well there's another part of
this that's very important.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:84%
The reason they can even
be here now, you say,

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:84%
is because the
frequencies of the planet

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.760 align:middle line:84%
have actually
shifted to the extent

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that they're
refining themselves.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
heard of the shift.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is not new news.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about it
with many different people

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.740 align:middle line:84%
from many different angles,
and from this angle.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Because this shift in
the frequencies of Earth

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensional
frequencies, the electromagnetic

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:15.260 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, and so forth-- have
actually refined themselves.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now these children are able
to come in and really start

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:90%
coming into the body more now.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.440 align:middle line:90%
At this time.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Could you talk about that?
-Yeah.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.960 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating to
watch because I think

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.850 align:middle line:84%
that original wave of
children, now adults, that

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:37.530 align:middle line:84%
are diagnosed with autism-- when
they came in, very challenging.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because that integration
process, the consciousness,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
was not what it is now.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
those individuals

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:84%
still look very
autistic in many ways.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And-- does not negate the
amazing work that they're

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:90%
doing in their lives.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, socially,
that's what they look like.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But as this consciousness has
been growing and developing,

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.390 align:middle line:84%
as we've become more
aware of ourselves,

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:84%
as our heart energies
are expanding

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and becoming more prevalent,
then all of a sudden

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
these individuals are beginning
to come into the body.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
fascinating to me

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because I talked
to a lot of parents

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, well,
I'm doing this diet.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm doing this therapy.
Or I'm doing this.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.517 align:middle line:84%
And, oh my gosh, my
child came into the body.

00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That my child is showing up.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:84%
-They showed up.
-Yeah.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is absolutely
a piece of it

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.400 align:middle line:84%
because the consciousness
is shifting.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I look at
it energetically,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:84%
they're coming in because
they can at this point.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at children
who are being born now

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and a year later-- whatever--
get that diagnosis,

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%
they're faring much better.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And their integration
process, it make sense.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They've had enough energy
and enough awareness

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:84%
that their integration
processes is much easier.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And with information like this
type of dialogue-- to have that

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:90%
awareness as your child is--

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.751 align:middle line:84%
Being diagnosed and
you're going into fear.

00:45:08.751 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:84%
-Absolutely.
-Right.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
To have that ability to
step back and kind of go,

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.070 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's a
bigger picture here.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Even asking that question,
what is this it's really about?

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Versus, what is everybody
telling me it's about?

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean our medical population
and our educational population

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:84%
are very much seeing this
through a left brained vantage

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.340 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
trained to do that.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing it very well.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the individuals
that they're looking at

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.314 align:middle line:84%
are not left brained individual.
-No.

00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not a left brained problem.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, it's
not a problem at all.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got
an individual who

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.950 align:middle line:84%
is trained to look at things
from the mental and emotional--

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:52.780 align:middle line:90%
or mental, physical model.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And you've got these
multi-dimensional beings

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:90%
sitting in front of them.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- it's like two
ships that cross in the night.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.140 align:middle line:84%
No ability to actually
see what's actually there.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So that system is
not working right now.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
the educational system

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.340 align:middle line:90%
is not working.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not working for
the ADD kids and ADHD.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not working
for the autisitc--

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.260 align:middle line:84%
even the ones who are coming
in and integrating better.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.490 align:middle line:84%
The system has fallen
far behind that.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to be bridged?

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen any
instances out there where

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:28.570 align:middle line:90%
they have made some headway?

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The system I believe will
absolutely fall apart.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But the people within
the system are rising

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.140 align:middle line:90%
up in their own consciousness.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So I watch this
day in and day out.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a lot of
teachers and therapists

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and there are these
individuals within this system

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:49.605 align:middle line:84%
that are-- one by one-- are
connecting with these kids.

00:46:49.605 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I have teachers all the
time call me and say,

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I've had this telepathic
communication with this child.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know I believe
this to be true.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
me this and that.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And they really just want
somebody to say you're fine.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You're doing exactly what
you're supposed to be doing.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But these individuals in
communication with the kids

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.680 align:middle line:84%
are really beginning
to interface

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:84%
with them so that they can
find out what the kids want.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
This educational
system is not for them.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Is not going to be developed
out of that mental and physical

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:84%
model that we've
had for so long.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
individuals who will

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.700 align:middle line:90%
learn by-- almost by osmosis.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
They learn by-- the way
they process information

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.240 align:middle line:90%
is very cyclical in nature.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So they learn cyclically,
versus the linear method

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.280 align:middle line:84%
that you know so many
children are taught

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.860 align:middle line:90%
and have always been taught.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So as individuals are awakening
to their own skill set,

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to their own
telepathy-- and this

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.200 align:middle line:84%
is what we do in the
certification process day in

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and day out.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:84%
As people really
understand that they're

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:90%
going directly to the kids.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean I don't know about
you-- I don't want to hear it

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:90%
from some educational expert.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what they want.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not what they want

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.890 align:middle line:84%
is so far out of the realm of
what we could have conceived.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, help me integrate
by bringing two tuning

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
forks and some colored silk.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you but I
wouldn't have thought of that.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the protocols.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
you to-- we're going

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the certification
process in just a little bit.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to know
what you're doing to help

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.340 align:middle line:84%
facilitate other people
to do what you do.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's one more story
I'd like you to share.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.186 align:middle line:84%
And this is one I didn't see in
the book, unless I missed out.

00:48:39.186 --> 00:48:40.680 align:middle line:84%
No.
It was after.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.120 align:middle line:84%
After the book, that
is about a little boy

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.360 align:middle line:90%
who finally showed up.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And your process with him.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.271 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind telling
us is this story?

00:48:50.271 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:84%
No.
Not at all.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Wyatt- a little
boy that I worked

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.680 align:middle line:84%
with-- I was seeing him
as his speech pathologist

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:90%
as well at the time.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And when he came in
about three years old,

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little
younger than three,

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:90%
he was diagnosed with autism.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.555 align:middle line:90%
He was pretty much nonverbal.

00:49:07.555 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of behaviors, a lot
of emotional kind of stuff.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And we would-- I just
had a nice bond with him.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.430 align:middle line:90%
He was just a wonderful kid.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would attempt
to telepathically

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.530 align:middle line:84%
communicate with him because
I knew that skill set.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a whole
lot going on at first.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back to speech
pathologist for a while.

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden he-- as we

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.110 align:middle line:84%
build this relationship,
this connection--

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.880 align:middle line:90%
he started coming to me.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I say coming
to me, he would

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.530 align:middle line:90%
show up through bilocation.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I would see him energetically
in like the backseat of my car

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:90%
and my house-- wherever.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Projecting a dimension of
himself to your reality.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point
he came and he said,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to be fully present.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to be here.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And when he said
it I was nervous,

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like,
what does that mean?

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be your
speech pathologist,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.240 align:middle line:84%
we're not supposed to be
doing all this other stuff.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But basically what
he did is I literally

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:84%
could feel him
energetically move

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.090 align:middle line:90%
his hand into my heart space.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And that heart
space just melted.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, we're
going to continue.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he asked me to
look at his neurology.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to look at
his cellular structure.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.140 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to look at
various systems of the body.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And he would direct me what to
do in those various systems.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we were finished-- we
spent about 45 minutes together

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
in that way-- and
when we were finished

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:84%
there was no doubt in my
mind that this child's

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:47.680 align:middle line:84%
decision was clear as day and
that it was going to happen.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So much so that I was
a little bit nervous

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.280 align:middle line:84%
because I was scheduled to see
him Mondays and Wednesdays,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Mondays and Wednesdays.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said this to him before
he left me in that state.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I'm a
little nervous about this.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'll take care of it.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So that Sunday-- that
happened on a Friday.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.640 align:middle line:84%
That Sunday his mother
called and she said,

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
you won't believe
this but I have

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to cancel our
appointment for Monday,

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.300 align:middle line:90%
we have a doctor's appointment.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.851 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I hear
him telepathically.

00:51:14.851 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:90%
I hear him giggling.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, I said I
would take care of it.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:90%
So I had a little reprieve.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I went-- what he basically
did is he unwound himself.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Monday to Wednesday,
Monday to Wednesday.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:29.950 align:middle line:84%
The first Wednesday
there are five new words.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:31.720 align:middle line:84%
The next Monday
there are sentences.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.840 align:middle line:84%
The next Wednesday there
are sentences put together

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and emotion with them.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it keeps
going and keeps going.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Then his mother says, we're
going to-- he's being taken out

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.800 align:middle line:84%
of his preschool classroom, his
special ed preschool classroom.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
transfer him, more

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.300 align:middle line:90%
time in the regular classroom.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And so anyway it went--

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.430 align:middle line:84%
He modulated it so that people
could accept what was going on

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
blowing everybody's

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.450 align:middle line:90%
minds in one svelte swoop.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And three months to the
day after that started,

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:02.390 align:middle line:84%
he walked through the
door and looked at me

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and he said, hi, I'm
Wyatt and I'm here.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And just the way he said it I
knew that it had taken place.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew that we were complete.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And his mother was brilliant.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.320 align:middle line:84%
She said I feel like he's
been on a long journey

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and he just finally got here.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:84%
God, it's beautiful.
OK.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
certification process.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a few minutes left.
-OK.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if someone is
hearing this and thinking,

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to be involved on some
level-- there are many levels.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
professionally.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.300 align:middle line:84%
The certification process is
really a threefold process.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that anybody
can develop the skill set.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of focus
and putting your attention

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and practice in certain places.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the threefold
process is basically

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.610 align:middle line:84%
creating a broader awareness of
who these children really are.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the second process
is an alignment to yourself.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have to know
who we are so that we

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:90%
can see with those eyes.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
process around that.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also the training

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:90%
in telepathic communication.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And for me that piece
is really important.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And that piece only happens
after that, at least

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.510 align:middle line:90%
initial, alignment to yourself.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that
awakening within you

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:23.640 align:middle line:84%
has to begin so that when you do
have telepathic communications

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.970 align:middle line:84%
with these kids
you have some way

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to integrate that
information and then pass it

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.050 align:middle line:84%
along to those
individuals who are just

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:32.050 align:middle line:90%
awakening to this awareness.

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And how long does this
take-- this process take?

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about 3 and 1/2, 4
months long is the process.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It's held in a
small group setting

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.410 align:middle line:84%
for about the first
seven weeks where we're

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:90%
kind of shifting perception.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we do an
awful lot of practice.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:90%
We practice, practice, practice.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Is Laura Alden Kamm
involved in this part at ll?

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw her on the
front of your book.

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Laura Alden Kamm wrote a
beautiful foreword for my book.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And she has been a guest speaker
for our certified practitioners

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.331 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't have an active
role in the processes itself.

00:54:04.331 --> 00:54:05.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And are these ongoing courses
so people can come in?

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it-- when do they start?

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Every four months?
Six months?

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Yep.
Our next one is in September.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So it'll start that
second week in September.

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about-- really a glimpse

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.590 align:middle line:90%
into our future.

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.880 align:middle line:90%
A brilliant glimpse.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:90%
A brilliant glimpse.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And these people that
have come in in this way

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.840 align:middle line:84%
are the way-showers of what
we're going to be like.

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or so left.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us just
that last little piece

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:38.340 align:middle line:84%
of what they're telling you
about where our entire species

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:90%
is going to be advancing into?

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We're really working
ourselves into what

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I would consider like a
technology of consciousness.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be conscious
of who we truly are

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and what's available to
us because we are that.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And once that really
takes place, number one,

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.990 align:middle line:84%
you are going to be
seeing these children

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:03.030 align:middle line:90%
in a very different view.

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll be saying to
yourself in a different vantage

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.410 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is just--
I don't even think we

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.880 align:middle line:90%
can describe it in some ways.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we have been looking at
things through this left brain.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's coming for us
is very-- a full experience

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:90%
of who we really are.

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to
kind of integrate.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And that means we
have to integrate

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:28.390 align:middle line:84%
this sensing-- feeling
sensitivity that they have.

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.140 align:middle line:84%
We can't become complete
if we continue along

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.610 align:middle line:90%
the path with our left brain.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They say, feel your
way through life,

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:36.970 align:middle line:90%
don't think your way through.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Suzy, I want to thank you so
much for being with us today.

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that many
people watching this

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.430 align:middle line:84%
have really had their
world turned upside down.

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And have learned to have a
completely new appreciation

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.610 align:middle line:84%
for these beautiful
little beings

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that have been
living amongst them.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is an astounding
view of what we have previously

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.410 align:middle line:84%
viewed of as someone
who was broken-- when

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:02.030 align:middle line:90%
in fact, they're total gifts.

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:03.380 align:middle line:84%
To learn more about
the basics you

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
can pick up a copy of Suzy's
Awesomism, or go to her website

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.180 align:middle line:90%
at suzymiller.com.

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on GAIAM TV.
