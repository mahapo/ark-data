00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our Los
Angeles studio.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to
reclaim your sleep, your sex

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
drive, your energy,
and your vitality?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
My guest today
Dr. Sara Gottfried

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:84%
is a Harvard physician,
an integrative medicine

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:90%
specialist, and a yoga teacher.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sara says there is an
epidemic of hormonal imbalance,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%
but most women don't know it.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to have the conversation

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
most people are not
having about sex hormones.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show,
Dr. Sara Gottfried.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.308 align:middle line:84%
>> SARA GOTTFRIED:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:57.337 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So how would we know
if we are hormonally imbalanced?

00:00:57.337 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well,
it's super simple.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:90%
You can just look at your belly.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have a muffin top, if
you have fat on your belly,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
chances are your hormones
are out of balance.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%
That can be cortisol.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol's the main
thing that does that,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be related to
your estrogen and progesterone

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.137 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's a simple way to do it.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:90%
You can also test labs.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
You can do my
questionnaire in my book.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So are you saying,
no matter what you do,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
if you diet, if you're on a
liquid diet or a green or raw,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever, you'll still have
that fat around your belly

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.384 align:middle line:90%
if you're hormonally imbalanced.

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: If you're
hormonally imbalanced,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:90%
there's certain telltale signs.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, belly
fat is a big one.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Another way to look
at this is mood.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're a total
cranky pants, that's

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
a problem probably related to
cortisol, thyroid, or estrogen

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.709 align:middle line:84%
and its tango with
progesterone, so there's

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
lots of different ways
that hormones can show up.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're on a liquid
diet or having the latest

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
green smoothie, I
think that's going

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
to reduce some of the
hormone issues that you have,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
but if you have a muffin top,
it's something to consider.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So all right, so
take into effect the mood.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
What would a mood
imbalance look like?

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Highs, lows, constant lows,
what does it look like?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, women
especially have moods that are

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
all over the place, and
when you're still cycling,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
PMS is very common.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
80% of women have PMS.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Men have mood issues, too,
but women are more than double

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
as likely to have
problems with mood.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Depression is very
commonly a hormone issue.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
50% of people, both men and
women, who have depression

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
have high cortisol.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So cortisol's that
stress hormone.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
We want it in that Goldilocks
position of not too high, not

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
too low.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
High cortisol can be an
indicator of depression.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:90%
You can also have low thyroid.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.324 align:middle line:84%
20% of people with depression
have a slow thyroid.

00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Let's
talk about cortisol

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.995 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
mystifier out there.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you know what
your cortisol levels are?

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.749 align:middle line:90%
How do you check for that?

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I'm a
fan of starting with your own

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
experience, and that's one
of the reasons why I included

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
the questionnaire, that I've
been using in my practice

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
for the past 10
years, in my book.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So in chapter one, you
can go through 122 items

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
on my checklist to
figure this out,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's things like do
you feel tired but wired?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Are you running task to task?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you have trouble
sleeping, either winding down

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
or you have disrupted sleep,
say between 2:00 and 4:00 AM?

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of
the classic symptoms

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of problems with cortisol.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
You can also measure it.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that
what you measure improves,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and you can check your
blood level of cortisol

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You can also do saliva
testing and check it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.067 align:middle line:84%
at four different
points during the day.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.441 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What do you mean by
"What you measure improves?"

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Your awareness of it?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.415 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well,
awareness changes everything.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You've titled this show
very appropriately.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think awareness is really
the key to self-realization,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
certainly hormone
balance, and there's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of value to measuring
your hormone levels.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not the entire
story, though.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's a problem called
hormone resistance, which

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is where your blood
levels may or may not

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
correspond to your
own experience,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.993 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I
think we need to look

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
at both because
sometimes you may have

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
all the symptoms
of a slow thyroid.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Say you've got
depression, weight gain,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and you feel fatigued.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You ask your doctor to
measure your thyroid,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're told
it's totally normal.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So I want to bring
together those two halves,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
your own experience and
also your blood levels,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we can figure
out how to move forward.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.857 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So how do you do that?

00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, when
someone comes to see you,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
what is their typical complaint?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
What do you hear
the most from women?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: The number one
issue that I hear is actually

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:90%
too much stress.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So it shows up in
different ways.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
For some women,
it's sugar cravings,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
like they start to
hear jungle drums.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's the
result of the stress.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:90%
That's how they--

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED:
That's the result--

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
so here's kind of the
flow, high stress, chronic,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
running task to task.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
That leads to high
cortisol levels,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
so your brain tells
your adrenal glands

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to keep pumping out the cortisol
because you are under threat.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
That high cortisol then can
make you have sugar cravings

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's raising
your blood sugar.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
jobs of cortisol.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So many of the
people at my practice

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
actually have sugar cravings
as their top symptom.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.115 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Ah, interesting and
then there comes the muffin

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
top.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Then you
have the muffin top.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Here comes
the muffin man.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Here
comes the muffin man,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and it depletes you of
the happy brain chemical.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to deplete
you of serotonin,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
that lovely neurotransmitter.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol does this, yeah.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
My assisstant calls
it Dr. Seratonin

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's in charge of
mood and sleep and appetite.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So you want serotonin also
in that Goldilocks position

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
of not too high, not too low.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so cortisol seems
to be the contributing factor

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.465 align:middle line:90%
to all things hormonal.

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Is this pretty close?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So I have found
that all paths lead back

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:90%
to cortisol.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found-- because
I'm also an MIT bio hacker,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and I love to obsessively
look at these things.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
When I've done quantitative
surveys of my clients,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I've found that 91% have
issues with their cortisol.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: 91%?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: 91%, and this
is the hormone that nobody is

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
talking about, so
cortisol is so important.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.305 align:middle line:84%
The cool part, the opportunity,
the sacred opportunity,

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:90%
is that you can manage this.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You can manage it like
you manage your 401(k).

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.654 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally tangible
hormone that you can manage.

00:06:25.654 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's what we
get to find out today,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.861 align:middle line:90%
which I'm really excited about.

00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look at your three steps

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:90%
to hormonal balancing.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.174 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.756 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: My new
book, the "Hormone Cure,"

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
helps women reclaim
sleep, sex drive, energy,

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and vitality with the
Gottfried Protocol,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
my unique three-step progressive
and scientifically proven

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
method to fix your
hormon problems.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
There's an epidemic
of hormone imbalance.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Most women have it,
but don't know it.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Disrupted sleep is a major sign
that your hormones are off.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I teach women how to balance
their hormones naturally

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
so that they feel
like themselves again.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Nothing makes you feel
back in your skin again

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:90%
like restorative sleep.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We know that, overall,
37% of the US population

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
struggles with sleep,
and that number

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
is far higher for women
beginning around age 35

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or older.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you three easy tips that

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
will help you sleep
restfully, and I

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
want to give you
examples of what

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I call the Gottfried Protocol.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Step one is lifestyle tweaks
and filling in nutritional gaps,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
step two is proven
herbal therapies,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and step three is bioidentical
hormones at the lowest doses

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and for the shortest duration.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
sleep, the root cause

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is often low melatonin
or low progesterone.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Your laptop, your iPad,
your iPhone, your Kindle

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
may be robbing you of sleep.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that the backlight,
the blue backlight,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in these tablets and your
laptop can block your melatonin.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is
essential to helping

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you fall into a restorative
sleep after the sun goes down,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:90%
so my first tip is a curfew.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Pick a curfew for your
laptop and for your tablet,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and from that point
onward, no digital.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Second tip, valerian; lousy
sleep, especially when the root

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
cause is hormonal,
has been treated

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years with valerian.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
A new randomized trial
in menopausal women

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
showed that valerian
at 530 milligrams

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
of extract improved sleep
in 30% of insomniacs.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Here's more good news.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
When valerian is taken
to help with sleep,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
there's no documented change in
reaction time, concentration,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:90%
alertness the next morning.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Not true with prescription
sleeping pills.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Third tip, are you
missing progesterone?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can't sleep, and
you're at least 35 years old,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
chances are you're
missing progesteroneone,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the main hormone
that helps women

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
feel soothed and ready
to sleep and stay asleep.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So if your curfew
and your valerian

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
don't get you the
sleep that you want,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I recommend trying a small
dose of progesterone.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Those are my three
best sleep tips,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you put
them into action today.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn more ways
to re-balance your hormones

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
again, I would love
it if you would

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
read my book the "Hormone Cure."

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 100
more tips to share

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
with you that are
evidence-based, fun,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and really move
the needle when it

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.885 align:middle line:84%
comes to creating
natural hormone balance.

00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:28.934 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I've so many
questions for you.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about what
happens to women's hormone

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:90%
after childbirth.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Do they drop dramatically?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Does the sex hormones
drop dramatically?

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: They
do drop dramatically.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:84%
When you deliver
that beautiful baby,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you deliver
the placenta,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
your hormones go from
sky high down to nothing,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and that is dramatic.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a preview of
coming attractions

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
because you are in a
reversible menopausal state,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of women
don't realize this.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
When I had my first baby,
I was sitting in my bed

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
breastfeeding, probably at
3:00 AM, sweating like a pig.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.714 align:middle line:84%
I was having hot
flashes, night sweats--

00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you
were in your 30s?

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: I was in my
30s, and I was like, oh,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I have no hormones.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I have no sex hormones.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
My estrogen is zero,
my progesterone

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
is zero, and the longer
that you breast feed,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the longer you stay suppressed
with your sex hormones.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.272 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the reasons
why women who have a baby

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
really don't have
a lot of interest

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
in sex for quite a long time.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.794 align:middle line:84%
So your hormones
definitely drop.

00:10:31.794 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that's interesting

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
cortisol is that women

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
who are depleted, who
are pushers and musters

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.119 align:middle line:84%
and just have sort
of overachievement

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
as part of their
motto-- I'm sure you

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:90%
know nothing about this.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was just
going to say that word.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So women who are
really depleted in cortisol--

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
remember, you can either
be too high or too low,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
or even both within
the same day.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Women who are low actually
feel better in pregnancy

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
because they share a
circulation with their baby, who

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:90%
has perfect adrenal glands.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they have normal cortisol
levels during pregnancy,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and then when they
deliver their baby,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:84%
often the cortisol goes from a
normal level down to low level

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
again, and that can feel
like postpartum depression.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be
thinking hormones

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
whenever there's
depression, even

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.461 align:middle line:90%
if it's postpartum depression.

00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: If you're stressed
out during your pregnancy,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
this is a little of
a diversion here,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
can you literally rob cortisol
from the baby's adrenal glands?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, your baby
is very good at taking care

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:90%
of itself.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We have enough places where
we make women feel guilty,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
so I don't think
we have evidence

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.315 align:middle line:84%
here that we're actually
robbing the poor baby

00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%
of its adrenal supply.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But we do have some evidence
that the amount of stress

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
you experience in utero
can shorten your longevity.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.315 align:middle line:84%
So we have evidence
with telomeres--

00:11:58.315 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
with those cute little caps that
are on your chromosomes, which

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
are the best marker of
biological as opposed

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:90%
to chronological aging.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence that your
telomeres can shorten,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
which is not a good thing,
when you're in utero if you're

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.826 align:middle line:84%
under a lot of
stress, high cortisol.

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: My goodness.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned that you
were an MIT trained biohacker.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I happened
to do a physician scientist

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
training program at the Harvard
MIT, kind of combination.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So they came together
to do a special program

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
for folks who wanted
to go into academics

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and be physician scientists.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So I did my training
in that setting,

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and I call myself a biohacker
mostly because, in my 30s,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I was a total train wreck.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I had PMS, low sex drive.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I was about 25 pounds
heavier than I am now.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I blamed my husband
for most things,

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and I was treating myself
with a glass or two

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
of wine every night,
which doesn't work.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was that,
when I went to my doctor

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
as many women do, I was
offered an antidepressant,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and that was a defining
moment for me, Lisa,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
because I realized we're
treating these problems

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:90%
with exactly the wrong things.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I had a hunch that my
problem was hormonal,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that my
cortisol was about three times

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
where should have been.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I fixed that
within about a month.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
When I did that,
everything changed.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I lost weight.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I loved my husband again.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You didn't have--

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: My
sex drive improved.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --the antidepressant?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: I didn't
need the antidepressant.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.992 align:middle line:90%
We live in a culture that is --

00:13:33.992 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Overprescribed.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: --in love

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
with masking symptoms
with pharmaceuticals,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and I really feel like the
way you eat, move, think,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and supplement is so
much more powerful.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Absolutely,
we are, yes,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is the power
that you give us,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
is information and how to find
out how to lower that cortisol.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So you described, what I
love in this next video,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:90%
is the typical Western women.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I eat too much, I drink
too much, I diet too much,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't sleep enough,
and then I give too much.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that is the
typical Western woman.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So is that what is
causing our stress,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
is overgiving,
overachieving, overdoing,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and then under doing?

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I agree that
women are wired to overprovide.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
We're wired to be
people pleasers.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.281 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a few
notable exceptions,

00:14:26.281 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part,
this is the problem

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of every woman I
know, and it's one

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons why we drive
ourselves into the ground.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Stress favors men.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm a feminist, so it
pains me to even say that.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Our system, like our control
system, kind of the government

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and how it talks
to our adrenals,

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that system is a lot
more vulnerable in women

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:90%
than it is in men.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why insomnia is twice as
high in women as it is in men.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why mood problems
are more common.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.237 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
think about how can we

00:14:54.237 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:90%
approach this differently.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The mantra of the
Western woman, I believe,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
is the mantra of low oxytocin.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So oxytocin is this lovely,
happy brain chemical,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
happy hormone, that does
many important things.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think it's
nature's best hormone therapy.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It lowers your cortisol,
it raises your estradiol,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and it makes your
thyroid more efficient.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lovely hormone
and neurotransmitter

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:90%
for men and women.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, men produce
oxytocin as well?

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.451 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's interesting.

00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It's also playing a big role
with social affiliation,

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
so folks who have
autism and schizophrenia

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
seem to have problems
with oxytocin.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It tends to lead to people being
more isolated, more online,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
more depressed,
and so that's why

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:90%
this is the latest party drug.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I think oxytocin is
really important.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important to amplify
the positive in the body,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.879 align:middle line:84%
and oxytocin is a
big part of that.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But oxytocin is
something that you can't take,

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's produced
naturally from within you,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.299 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: You can take it.

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a fan of that because
the data is actually not

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:84%
very convincing that it's
worthwhile to take it.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
There's some physicians who
advocate taking oxytocin

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to augment orgasm or to help
with this social isolation

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
that men, especially, have.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But what I've found
from the evidence

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
is that it's better to raise
your own endogenous oxytocin,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:90%
and you can do that with a hug.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So based on the half
life of oxytocin,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you want to hug
eight times a day,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.397 align:middle line:84%
and not just like the social
hug that is not a big deep hug.

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A hello hug, yes.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.855 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: We're talking
about like the Obama Michelle

00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:41.944 align:middle line:84%
hug on election night, like that
full on, hold it for a while.

00:16:41.944 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to hold men
for a little longer

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
than you have to hold a woman
for the same spike in oxytocin.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure most men
that are watching

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
were wondering, when you said
that the sex hormone drop

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
after breastfeeding and
childbirth, when do they ever

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:90%
come back?

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, they
do gradually come back,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
so if you stop breastfeeding
and you get back to kind

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of business as
usual in your body,

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%
you reclaim these hormones.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, starting between
35 and 45 for women,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:90%
you run out of ripe eggs.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's certainly
women who have

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
babies well into their
40s, but when you run out

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
of ripe eggs, that's when your
sex hormone start to change.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's when progesterone
starts to drop first,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of
like nature's Valium.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.489 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
for soothing.

00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Progesterone is?

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Progesterone,
and so progesterone,

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
as that starts to drop,
your sleep can get worse.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You may notice that your periods
get a little closer together.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the second phase
of perimenopause,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
typically 45 to 50 or 55, is
when estrogen starts to drop.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a baby-- I
had my first child at 32,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and my hormones went back to
normal within about a year.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%
I breastfed for about a year.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, and then so you
mentioned something called

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:90%
sexopause.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
You said perimenopause,
menopause,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.156 align:middle line:90%
but what is sexopause.

00:18:02.156 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Sexopause is when
you notice either a gradual

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:84%
deminution in the sex
that you're having,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's more sudden.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
For some folks, after
they have a baby,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they never really integrate
kind of these redefined roles,

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and they just find that sex
becomes the lowest priority.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.297 align:middle line:84%
It's put on the back burner,
so sexopause, I would say,

00:18:27.297 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:90%
is something that's very common.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to think it
was an epidemic,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.289 align:middle line:90%
and then "50 Shades" came out.

00:18:31.289 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And now I think it's
actually the sex

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.374 align:middle line:90%
on the menu that's the problem.

00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, we're going to
talk about that in a second.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look
at this great video that

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
shows steps to bring the
passion and the romance

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
back into the
marriage or a life.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.915 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:57.692 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:57.692 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NICOLE DAEDONE: So one of
the biggest things I see women

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:84%
entering my office with
is a lack of desire,

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the ensuing guilt
that they don't want it,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:90%
that they feel like they should.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So then they go into
this kind of obligation

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:90%
when they look at sexuality.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And have you seen much of this?

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Oh, my god.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the most common
symptom that women have.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So my focus is really
on women from their 20s

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
on up to their 60s, and
libido, lack of sex drive,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.782 align:middle line:90%
is the number one issue.

00:19:32.782 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NICOLE: And it's
a cycle, right?

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't
feel desire, then

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel guilty about
not feeling desire,

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:84%
then that guilt makes
me not feel desire.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: And
I'm having less sex,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and I become more averse to
it because I don't like what

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:84%
my partner is doing, and
then it's a vicious cycle.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.434 align:middle line:90%
It just gets worse and worse.

00:19:49.434 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NICOLE: And then
because I'm adverse to it,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.974 align:middle line:84%
I want to keep my
husband away from me,

00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and the best way I do that is
by thinking about him critically

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and pushing him away.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so beginning to
reverse that cycle,

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I know as a women, desire for
me had been this kind of enigma.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It was this thing, and it
would enter by accident,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
almost like the
muse or something.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It would come when it
came, and then it would go.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I began
to discover there's

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
a way to work with it that is,
again, slower and much more

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
suited to my body,
so in my mind,

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:90%
there's four stages of desire.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:84%
There's first, and
what's shocking

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
is most women-- we aren't
even connected here,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.225 align:middle line:90%
and that's knowing what we want.

00:20:33.225 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I can look out.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.725 align:middle line:84%
I'll be teaching, and
there'll be a group of women.

00:20:36.725 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say do you
know what you want?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.595 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be this
look like-- just shock.

00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The next layer then is
being able to communicate

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:90%
what we want.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
what a woman will say

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, no, I can't ask for
what I want because if I do,

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
he'll think there's
something wrong.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
He'll think that
he's not very smart,

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:90%
or he doesn't know what to do.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
The third layer then, which is
interesting because most of us

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
don't even make it
here, is to begin

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to actually acknowledge
what we've received,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate
that acknowledgement.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We're so scarce that we
are used to getting what

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.600 align:middle line:84%
we want from a man
by withholding,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
so it's directing
him by not giving,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and the number one
thing would be sex.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So you aren't getting any sex
because you didn't bring out

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:90%
the garbage.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
is really beginning

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to live in this
place of gratitude,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like you begin
to shift tanks from a mind

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.234 align:middle line:84%
that chronically notices
what we're missing.

00:21:45.234 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I have these women
come in and say

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
like he won't give
me what I want.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:90%
He won't do what I want.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And the guys, they're
like, please, just tell me.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Tell me anything.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Just let me do it, but
she can't see that.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
she's in that tank,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.286 align:middle line:84%
and then switching over
to this other tank.

00:22:02.286 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think you might have
some thoughts on this in terms

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of how this is
hormonally effected,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
but that place
where-- like I know,

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, I can
look at my boyfriend,

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and I can see this
guy who eats too fast.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
He really just eats too fast.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Or I can see the
same man, and I can

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
see this man who never, not
once, has not received me

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.962 align:middle line:84%
when I came in to cuddle
with him or hug him.

00:22:27.962 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: That
is so beautiful.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
changing your story.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.885 align:middle line:84%
We get attached to this story
of what our marriage is like

00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
or what our relationship
is like or these habits

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that we don't like
in our partner

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting to that
place of really appreciating

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
what he or she does offer.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I eat, drink, and sleep
the hormonal determinants

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of desire, and those are
estrogen and progesterone

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
in right balance,
cortisol where you

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
want it to be, not too high,
not too low, and then thyroid

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So those three are
really important,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's also overly
reductionistic

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to look at it that way.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's in the context
of connectivity.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Connectivity is so
important for women,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
women don't realize this.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You write about in your book,
I believe, about how men often

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
need sexual connection
to feel connected.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
They need sex to feel
connected, and women

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
need sexual connection
to be receptive to sex.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.761 align:middle line:84%
>> NICOLE: That's
exactly it, yes.

00:23:31.761 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: And so
you're set up for this gap.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You're set up for
a total disconnect,

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and unless you really get
that, unless you understand it,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be batting heads.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NICOLE: Exactly.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.269 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That is so true.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So women need connection,
and men need sex.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:90%
So we're constantly doing this.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So what do you suggest to do?

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I've got
a long list and an a la carte

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
menu here, but I think the
first thing is really to look

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
at the biology.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
We know that 70% of low
sex drive is hormonal,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and what I find is that
when there's a couple,

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
difference in sex drive,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:84%
typically it's the male
partner wants more sex.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The female partner is--
she'd rather mop the floor.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
What I think is so
important is not

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to blame the low libido
partner, and to look

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:84%
at this as a couple's issue,
and start with the biology.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to blame themselves,
and I want to say it's not you.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's your hormones.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start
with the hormones.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.919 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so start with
balancing the hormones?

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
When you say start with the
hormones, what do you mean?

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.584 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the edge
of my chair here.

00:24:49.584 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So the first
thing is always cortisol

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
because cortisol is the
top priority in the body.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
important because it's

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
what raises your blood pressure,
raises your blood sugar.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It modulates your immune system,
and it will send a text message

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:84%
if it's high to slow down your
thyroid, make you gain weight.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It'll send a text
message to your ovaries,

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
or if you're man,
to your testes,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
to slow down the production
of testosterone in men,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:84%
estrogen, progesterone,
testosterone in women.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is working
against you if cortisol

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.879 align:middle line:90%
is too high or too low.

00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so in men, let's
talk about men's libido,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.274 align:middle line:84%
and does a man's libido drop
off after a certain age as well?

00:25:35.274 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: It does.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Tends to be that it's
more gradual than what

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:90%
we see in women.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Women typically find a
change in their sex drive

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:84%
right after having a
baby and then again

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
in perimenopause,
and for most women,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that's sometime
between 35 and 50.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The average age for menopause
is 51 in American women.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So for men between
40 and 70, there

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:84%
can be this phenomenon
of andropause,

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:03.210 align:middle line:84%
also known as
man-opause, which is

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
where testosterone
starts to decline.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Slowly.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Slowly,
and as it declines,

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:90%
estrogen can climb in men.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
ratio starts to shift.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:16.584 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:26:16.584 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:90%
How does this show up?

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
For some men, it comes as
low sex drive or just less

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.230 align:middle line:90%
ambition.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes call this
Grumpy Old Man Syndrome

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
because you may find
that your man is just not

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
quite as vigorous
as he used to be.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.944 align:middle line:84%
Maybe his muscles
are not as strong.

00:26:33.944 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't get the same
response from the gym,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even doesn't want
to go to the gym anymore.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.665 align:middle line:84%
It can also give you
more love handles.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It can give you
man boobs, so those

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
are some of the changes
that could happen.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.923 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Interesting, and that
happens between 40 and 70 years

00:26:46.923 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
old and mostly in men?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.425 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:51.345 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so what
are some major--

00:26:51.345 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you said the top five
libido hijackers.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I think
the number one thing is blaming

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
yourself or blaming
your partner.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:90%
That just sets up resentment.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Resentment is not
a good thing, so we

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.352 align:middle line:84%
want to just turn that
around immediately.

00:27:07.352 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Start with the biology.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the solution there.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the refrain.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Number two, we're too stressed.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:90%
We're really busy.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We are turning our
power over to cortisol,

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
so I want us to reclaim
our power from cortisol.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Get into the kind of dance
that you could ideally

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:90%
be having with cortisol.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes joke that cortisol's
like the bad boyfriend hormone.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like the guy that took you
out for fast food and alcohol

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.505 align:middle line:90%
every night in college.

00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And you knew it was
going to end badly,

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:90%
but you went there anyway.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol's a bit like
that, and what we want

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
is to really kind of
keep it in a narrow range

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:90%
so that it supports you.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't rob you of memory.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't give you brain fog.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take you on that
path toward Alzheimer's disease.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's keep it
in the right place.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Number three is having
a problem with estrogen.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is true
for men and women.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We want estrogen
to be like this--

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
we want to be on the
estrogen balance beam,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
where we have it
in the right place,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:90%
not too high, not too low.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And for women, that's
true from puberty

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:84%
until the day we die, so
you want it, in women,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to be in balance
with progesterone.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And for men, you want it to be
in balance with testosterone.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: All right,
so number four is?

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Number four is we
don't love the one we're with.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens here is that
we have a negativity bias.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:84%
70% of our thoughts
tend to be negative,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:90%
and we can reframe that.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
The more that we
accept our partner

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and educate so that
they have the tools,

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and they know what we want--

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And you grow together.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.899 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: And
you grow together,

00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and you really are just in
radical acceptance of who

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:90%
your partner is, that helps.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.353 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: This is very important.

00:28:53.353 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So the partner might not
be doing anything wrong,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:90%
like you had explained earlier.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It's your perception
of that partner, driven

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:84%
by the hormones and the low
and high cortisol swings that

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.989 align:middle line:84%
cause that perception, and
they're still the same person.

00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Exactly true, and
I would even take it one step

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:90%
further if we may.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say for
folks who are trying

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
to balance their hormones,
there's a secret sauce here,

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:90%
and here's the secret sauce.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The more that you amplify
the positive, especially

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
from your heart,
heart connection,

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going
to be in acceptance,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going
to feel gratitude,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going to
feel forgiveness and prevent

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:90%
resentment.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is really a way
of accepting responsibility

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in your relationships and not
blaming the other partner.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I sometimes say that
people who focus on calming down

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
are not as successful,
in my opinion, as people

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
who amplify the positive in
the body, who really amplify

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:90%
the innate intelligence.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And your heart actually
tells your brain

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
to tell your
adrenals what to do.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not your brain
that's in charge, that's

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
telling your adrenals,
which produce cortisol,

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
produce progesterone
and estrogen.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So daily affirmations,
you can say forever,

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
but unless you feel it with
your emotions in your heart,

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.282 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't send the right
message to the body to relax.

00:30:15.282 --> 00:30:16.406 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:30:16.406 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can be as
simple as just imagining

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing
into your heart.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple
as that, so just belly

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
breathing, inhaling,
into your heart

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and exhaling from your heart.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It starts to flip
the balance, and it

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:90%
starts to amplify the positive.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It releases oxytocin
from the heart.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say number five is we
live in an oxytocin deficient

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.380 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We need to create more oxytocin
by any means necessary,

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
so there's lots of
different ways to do that.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%
You can call a girlfriend.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That does it?

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.675 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: That does it.

00:30:52.675 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that
the best way for a man

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to improve his health
is to be with a woman.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The best way for a women
to improve her health

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:90%
is to be with her girlfriends.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
There's something about being
with women, probably oxytocin,

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that leads to longevity
and better health.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.695 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now, why is the best
way for a man to improve his

00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:90%
health to be with a woman?

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So this is
based on decades of research.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We know that, for instance,
when you look at marriages,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:84%
we know that men tend to drop
their cortisol when they come

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
home, so men really
have this benefit when

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:84%
it comes to marriage
and being with a woman

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that women don't
necessarily get from men.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Mm-hmm, they get it
from talking with other women.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:37.866 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: They do.

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:90%
So you can take a hot bath.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:90%
You can--

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Give to yourself.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.295 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: You
can give to yourself.

00:31:42.295 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I think resentment is really
a sign of deficient self-care.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the way we
should be looking at resentment.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to feel
resentment in a relationship,

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and it comes up a lot around
sexuality and low sex drive,

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.470 align:middle line:84%
look at it as a way to
up-level your self care.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So up-leveling self
care also would increase

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.865 align:middle line:90%
your hormone production, right?

00:32:03.865 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it depends on the
self care that you're doing,

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's certain
things that you

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:84%
can do that really are going to
help you with hormone balance.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to share
some of those with you.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.953 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Absolutely.

00:32:12.953 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have what you call
the Charlie's Angels, right?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes, yes, so I
like to keep this astonishingly

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
simple when it comes to women
and the main needle movers.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to balance
your hormones as a women

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
are to balance cortisol,
estrogen, and thyroid.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're a guy, I call it
the Three Amigos-- cortisol,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:90%
testosterone, thyroid.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, OK, so
that makes sense.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So you need all of these
things to be in a good range.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've understood
the problems,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and we've definitely laid
out the problems here.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:90%
We need to get to solutions.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know what a good
range is, or does it matter?

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as just
the lay person, how

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:84%
can we get these
in a good range?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, the good
range is where you really feel

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
your best, and you're
able to rock your mission.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:90%
You're living life fully.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So that is going to vary a
bit from person to person,

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:84%
but based on what we know
from collecting laboratory

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
data on tons and tons of people,
there are optimal ranges.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They're different than the 95%
range, the bell shaped curve,

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that's on maybe the lab slip
that you have from your doctor.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to your
thyroid, for instance,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I was taught in medical
school that a range somewhere

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:90%
between 0.5 and 5.0 is good.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell
you-- this is TSH,

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:90%
thyroid stimulating hormone.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you when I had
a TSH 10 years ago of 3.5,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I felt like crap.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:90%
My hair was falling out.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I was moody.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I was tired, especially
in the afternoon.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.603 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Eyebrows were thinning.

00:33:47.603 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Lost the
outer third of my eyebrows,

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and 3.5 was not good for me.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We have new data that shows
that the optimal range for men

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and women is
between 0.3 and 1.5.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So where do you
get these ranges?

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I have it in my
book, so that's where

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:90%
you can find these ranges.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of the labs that are
focused on natural hormone

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
balancing and
integrative medicine

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:90%
will give you similar ranges.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so in order
to get the thyroid in check

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and in balance, what
do you recommend?

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: A couple
things for the thyroid.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I use something called the
Gottfried Protocol in my book.

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's what I used to
balance my own hormones,

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and then I applied
it to the next 10

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:84%
years of 10,000 patients that
I took care of to refine it.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that you
start with a first step, which

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is to fill the nutritional
gaps that you have,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and also to make targeted
lifestyle changes.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to your thyroid,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.921 align:middle line:90%
copper, zinc, selenium--

00:34:46.921 --> 00:34:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Minerals?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: --iodine,
vitamin D, and cortisol.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You want all six of
those in the happy place,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
not too high, not too low,
to really get your thyroid

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
operating in the
way that you want.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that my
cortisol was too high,

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.650 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, and that was
robbing me of thyroid hormone.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:84%
When I corrected the
cortisol, it fixed my thyroid.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this
knee jerk response,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and I know because I went
through conventional medical

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.290 align:middle line:84%
training, where we tend to
go with the pharmaceutical.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid problem, take
this thyroid medication.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.399 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Or take cortisol?

00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Or take cortisol.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I think a better
solution is to look

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
at whether you have any
nutritional gaps that you need

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to fill, so that's what I'd
recommend for the thyroid.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Get those levels
checked and filled in.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And nutritional
gaps would be which ones?

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.330 align:middle line:90%
What types of--

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So like
low copper, for instance,

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
low selenium.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a client last week that
I saw about six weeks ago,

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and she had a slow thyroid.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
She had many symptoms
of a slow thyroid.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
She also had hair
loss, weight gain,

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.907 align:middle line:90%
and just felt really fatigued.

00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Very tired?

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: You know, way
too young to feel so old.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.500 align:middle line:84%
She was 43 years old,
and what we found

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:90%
was that her copper was low.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So we started her
on a multivitamin

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:84%
that contained copper, about
two milligrams a day of copper,

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and that corrected
her thyroid perfectly.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:84%
She didn't need any
thyroid medication.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So within six weeks,
she was back to normal,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:90%
back to her old self.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
She went running up
the stairs of her house

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and said to me,
"I haven't run up

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:90%
the stairs in a very long time.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:29.694 align:middle line:90%
You gave me my life back."

00:36:29.694 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's great.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can correct thyroid
imbalance, for the most part,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
by starting with a good
multivitamin, multi,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.505 align:middle line:90%
with minerals, right?

00:36:38.505 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: That's right.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.386 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Just starting there
and seeing what happens

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:90%
to your energy levels.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
If once you do that, and you
go through a certain amount

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:84%
of time with that, and
they're still off balance,

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.310 align:middle line:84%
do you recommend the Synthroids
or the natural thyroids?

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes, so if you're
not able to get your thyroid

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
where you want it to be, and
you're working at this point

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:84%
with a clinician, and you're not
able to get your labs where you

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:84%
want it to be, and you're also
not feeling like your full

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:84%
capacity, then I think
it's important to move

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:90%
on to bioidentical hormones.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So here, I'm talking
about hormones

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that are exact replicas of what
you are making in your body,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not in
the same supply.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a fan of natural
dessicated thyroid.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
different brands of this,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
but the idea is that
it's got all four

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.200 align:middle line:90%
of the thyroid hormones.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:90%
You make T1, T2, T3, T4.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It refers to the
number of iodine atoms

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
on each thyroid
molecule, and I believe

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.170 align:middle line:90%
in replacing all of those.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.115 align:middle line:84%
Not just Synthroid
because that's just T4.

00:37:40.115 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about
iodine for a second?

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I understand that some
people, when they take iodine,

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like throwing gasoline on a
fire if you have a certain type

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:90%
of thyroid.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So iodine, you have
to be careful with.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned copper, zinc,
selenium, iodine, vitamin D,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and cortisol.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But iodine, if you
have something called

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune thyroiditis, also
known as Hashimoto's or Hashi's

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:84%
for short, if you
have that problem,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
then you have to really
be cautious about iodine.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Some people really have
trouble taking iodine.

00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And how would they
know if that was a problem?

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.526 align:middle line:84%
If they took the iodine,
what type of reaction

00:38:18.526 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:90%
would they have?

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, there's a
number of symptoms that people

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:90%
can have.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It can vary from
person to person,

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
but it can exacerbate
your symptoms.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It can make you feel worse,
like it can worsen your fatigue.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.034 align:middle line:84%
It can cause other
problems, thyroid problems.

00:38:34.034 --> 00:38:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
very good to know.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:39.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've talked about
the function of cortisol

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.580 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about the
three, you mentioned,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Charlie's Angels, estrogen,
cortisol, and thyroid,

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:84%
so you have some
great ways of being

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:84%
able to balance the
cortisol in the body.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is a master
hormone in the body.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It controls a lot
of different things,

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.577 align:middle line:84%
so if you want it to stay
out of being too high

00:38:59.577 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and out of being too
low and somewhere

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.127 align:middle line:84%
in that mid-range,
what do you suggest?

00:39:04.127 --> 00:39:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I
have a few techniques.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Can I share them with you?

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:07.431 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Please, yes.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.175 align:middle line:84%
This is like an appointment
with your doctor.

00:39:10.175 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So I
brought my iPhone with me.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the iPhone is
both a blessing and a curse

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.100 align:middle line:84%
because this is the thing
that keeps us so wired,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and my great grandmother
wasn't dealing with this.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Michael Pollan says
don't eat any food

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:84%
that your great grandparents
wouldn't recognize,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and she wouldn't recognize this.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But this can also be
your savior because there

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
are some apps that
can really help you

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:90%
with your cortisol level.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
An example of this is
GPS for the Soul, which

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.227 align:middle line:84%
is a free app that
you can download.

00:39:44.227 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's called GPS--

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.101 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: It's
called GPS for the Soul,

00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and you can use your finger
over the camera as a way

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.700 align:middle line:84%
of measuring your
stress response.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.965 align:middle line:84%
It measures something called
heart rate variability, which

00:39:55.965 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is simply just the time
between each heartbeat,

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's a measure of coherence.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.593 align:middle line:84%
We were talking earlier about
connecting to your heart, kind

00:40:04.593 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:84%
of the wisdom of your heart, and
this is a way to train in that.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Another technique you
can use is something

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:84%
called the Inner Balance, and
this comes with a little sensor

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that you can put
on your earlobe.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And it measures your
heart rate variability,

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.757 align:middle line:90%
and it also trains you.

00:40:22.757 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the cool part.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.160 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just
some woo-woo idea.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.740 align:middle line:84%
These techniques-- you put
it on your earlobe like this

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:90%
and then measure your levels.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The cool part is
that this has been

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
shown to lower your
cortisol by 23%.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: By awareness?

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Awareness
and activating the oxytocin

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.810 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:51.084 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: And really
stepping into these positive

00:40:51.084 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
emotions that we're
talking about.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can train to do
that, and it can make you

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:90%
more stress resiliant.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.194 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is it like the
more practice that you do,

00:40:58.194 --> 00:41:00.651 align:middle line:84%
the better you get at it, the
more the cortisol gets lower?

00:41:00.651 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: You
get more efficient.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The other thing it does
besides lowering cortisol

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is it raises your DHEA, which is
one of those sexy hormones that

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
leads to testosterone, which
both men and women need.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.129 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Another tip-- can
I give you some supplements?

00:41:17.129 --> 00:41:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So I mentioned
that I have a fondness for red

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.284 align:middle line:90%
wine.

00:41:23.284 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, I wanted
to ask you about that.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, don't take
away my red wine.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yeah, I'm not
taking your red wine away,

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but what I found was that I
really gained a fair amount

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of weight when I was drinking
one or two classes a night.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
We know from recent
data from Harvard

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that three to six
servings a week

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is associated with an increased
risk of breast cancer in women.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying you
don't need to drink.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:84%
That's really only
for alcoholics,

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.010 align:middle line:90%
but drink less, better quality.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But you had said that
red wine increases cortisol.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: It does, so
alcohol raises cortisol.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:84%
The very thing that you think
you're getting from alcohol,

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:90%
it's actually robbing from you.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It's robbing from you.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.237 align:middle line:84%
And it may help you
fall asleep more easily,

00:42:06.237 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to
be high quality sleep.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be disrupted.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.935 align:middle line:84%
So drink less,
better quality, and I

00:42:11.935 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:90%
have a new cocktail for you.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So a few supplements that
I think are really great,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
omega-3s, fish oil.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.307 align:middle line:84%
It's the most proven
supplement ever.

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is, yes.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.181 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So you can
eat wild Alaskan salmon,

00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and you can get a vegetarian
source of omega-3s.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But omega-3s, in both women
and men, lower cortisol levels.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
They also increase
lean body mass.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:35.510 align:middle line:90%
We all want that.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.131 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting, OK, OK.

00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Another one
is phosphatidylserine.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is your new cocktail,
omega-3s, phosphatidylserine,

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:84%
which is like an extract from a
cell membrane, totally natural.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It can change your
mood within an hour.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:50.765 align:middle line:90%
It's dramatic.

00:42:50.765 --> 00:42:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It lowers cortisol.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's very effective.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is it
plant-based cell membrane?

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.981 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: It's plant-based.

00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:57.945 align:middle line:84%
It adjusts your
mood dramatically.

00:42:57.945 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Fascinating.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: And then
last one is rhodiola.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.151 align:middle line:84%
So step two of the
Gottfried Protocol

00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is proven botanical therapies.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Rhodiola is the most
proven to help you

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:90%
with high cortisol levels.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And then my absolute favorite
that I have to mention,

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:84%
since I am limiting your
wine, is dark chocolate.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.444 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:43:16.444 --> 00:43:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I've heard it's a
natural aphrodisiac, yes?

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.318 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: It's a
natural aphrodisiac,

00:43:20.318 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
probably because it
lowers cortisol levels.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, and what else
is a natural aphrodisiac?

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well,
there's a number.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Oysters are considered
a natural aphrodisiac,

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.586 align:middle line:84%
and I think because
they're so rich in copper.

00:43:34.586 --> 00:43:35.994 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, minerals again.

00:43:35.994 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So it's going
to help you with your thyroid.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So dark chocolate to help you
with your cortisol levels.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Oysters to help you
with your thyroid.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:44.932 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And maca?

00:43:44.932 --> 00:43:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
maca's also a good one?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: I'm
a big fan of maca,

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
so if you're someone who
tends to be low in estrogen,

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're 45 plus, maca's
very effective at raising

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:90%
your estrogen levels.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's also been proven to
raise libido and decrease

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.616 align:middle line:90%
anxiety and depression.

00:44:01.616 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: My goodness.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you tend to
be high in estrogen,

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.769 align:middle line:90%
it's probably not so safe.

00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: If you tend
to be high in estrogen,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:84%
so maybe you have
breast tenderness,

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have weight
loss resistance,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:84%
then you want to be careful
about maca and maybe track

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:90%
your levels.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Track your ratio of
progesterone to estrogen.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So once again, just
to review because I

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:84%
think it's very important
that people know this,

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that cortisol is--
high cortisol basically

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:84%
leads to-- it is the
main stress hormone.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It also raises blood
glucose and blood pressure,

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:90%
which is not good.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And it also mediates
inflammation.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that if cortisol
is working for you, not

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.605 align:middle line:84%
against you, if it's in that
Goldilocks position, then

00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
your blood pressure's
going to be fine.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
raise it as needed,

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:84%
like when you're
running from tiger.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going to raise
blood glucose as needed.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
It's going to keep your immune
system where it needs to be.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.496 align:middle line:84%
But if it's too high, it can
raise your blood pressure

00:45:05.496 --> 00:45:05.995 align:middle line:90%
too much.

00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It can raise your
blood sugar too much.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why you lay
down the belly fat.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And it can make your immune
system over activated

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and lead to more
autoimmune conditions.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK, very interesting.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you have
those types of things,

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:84%
what you recommended
is obviously

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.700 align:middle line:84%
the things in the bag, the
magic purse, the rhodiola,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.745 align:middle line:90%
the phosphatidylserine?

00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED:
Phosphatidylserine,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.170 align:middle line:90%
PS for short.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.190 align:middle line:84%
The great thing about Google is
you can just put it in there,

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how you
spell it, it'll show up.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.193 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right, great.

00:45:36.193 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And then also the
apps, which is GPS

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.257 align:middle line:84%
for the Soul, which
I absolutely love.

00:45:40.257 --> 00:45:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: And Inner Balance.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to use that
little earlobe sensor--

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's the other one.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: --Inner
Balance is the other one.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK, all right.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So I have to ask you about
the "50 Shades of Grey" book.

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned--
did you love that book?

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: I
did love this book.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a bit of a
literary snob, and I

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.840 align:middle line:90%
didn't love it in that regard.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So I can't say that
this is a book that's

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:90%
beautifully written.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Right, I don't
think it was supposed to be.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: No, I agree, and
what I thought was stunning was

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was a "New York Times"
best seller for so long.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's still
in the top 10 list,

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:84%
the entire trilogy of
the "50 Shades" series.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:84%
What I think is amazing
about this book is

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that it really captured
women's imagination

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and tapped into something, I
think, very deep and important

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:34.970 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about the
mantra of the Western woman.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I eat too
much, I drink too much,

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I shop too much,
and still there's

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.190 align:middle line:90%
this void that I can't fill.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a void being
filled by pleasure in that

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.040 align:middle line:84%
book, and we could take
a page out of that book.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's an
important lesson there

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.080 align:middle line:84%
about us being
oxytocin deficient.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.242 align:middle line:84%
We need to raise our oxytocin
levels with pleasure.

00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Overall,
in your practice,

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:84%
it proved to be
a positive thing?

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.651 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes, absolutely.

00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: All right, well, we're
going to take a look at this

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:84%
next video and more
tips, additional tips,

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
on how to enjoy life a
little bit more as women.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.084 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Hi, I'm
Dr. Sara Gottfried.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I help women balance
their hormones naturally.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:84%
My new book, the
"Hormone Cure," helps

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:84%
women reclaim sleep,
sex drive, energy,

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and vitality with the
Gottfried Protocol,

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:33.610 align:middle line:84%
my unique three-step progressive
and scientifically proven

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
method to correct
your hormone problems.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Every day in my medical
practice, women tell me

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they're overwhelmed, tapped
out, irritated, not sleeping.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to
share with you easy tips.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.380 align:middle line:84%
My first tip is what
I call Tiara Time.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So most of the
stressed out women

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.250 align:middle line:84%
whom I work with need
to hit the pause button,

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:90%
but here's the irony.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:00.580 align:middle line:84%
They feel too busy to
do what they need most,

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.340 align:middle line:90%
so here's how you get started.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.910 align:middle line:84%
You put a tiara on
your head, and you

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
signal to your family, your
spouse, your kids, the world,

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that you are hitting
the pause button.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It is me time.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You say to your family
mommy is taking Tiara Time.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:90%
See you in 15 minutes.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Pause button, do it
3 times per week.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.544 align:middle line:84%
The second tip is to introduce
you to your new cocktail.

00:48:25.544 --> 00:48:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about the cocktail

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.180 align:middle line:90%
you might be thinking of.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.270 align:middle line:84%
When you're stressed
out of your mind,

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a drink
after work seems

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:84%
like just what the
doctor ordered.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, not this doctor.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The science shows that
alcohol raises cortisol.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Here's the sobering truth.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:84%
The very thing you
previously thought

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
you were getting from a
glass of wine, relaxation,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is actually being
taken from you.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I recommend instead.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Take two proven supplements
as your new cocktail,

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.100 align:middle line:90%
phosphatidylserine and rhodiola.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Both have been proven in
randomized trials, the best

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
evidence that we have, to
lower your cortisol levels when

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:90%
they're too high.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:84%
These, today, are
my destressing tips.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.420 align:middle line:84%
These tips are based on
reversing the top seven hormone

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.910 align:middle line:84%
problems that my patients,
who are aged from 18 to 88,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:18.870 align:middle line:90%
suffer from.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn more ways
to re-balance your hormones

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:84%
again, I would love
it if you would

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.910 align:middle line:84%
read my book, the
"Hormone Cure."

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 100
more tips to share

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.780 align:middle line:84%
with you that are
evidence based, fun,

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and really move
the needle when it

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.875 align:middle line:84%
comes to creating
natural hormone balance.

00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so tell me
about focus and attention

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and multitasking where it
comes to stress and cortisol.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that women
tend to overmax themselves

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Attention
Deficit Disorder?

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, Attention
Deficit is really interesting

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.990 align:middle line:90%
in women.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I think of Attention
Deficit as really

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.370 align:middle line:90%
being an issue in younger boys.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.700 align:middle line:84%
That's typically when
it's first diagnosed.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And then for girls
and for women,

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.520 align:middle line:84%
there's two places
where it shows up--

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.350 align:middle line:84%
as a girl in school and
then again in perimenopause.

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So when women enter
perimenopause,

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes call it
the perfect storm

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:84%
because it tends to be that
all three Charlie's Angels are

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:90%
affected.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Your estrogen is out of
balance with progesterone,

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.920 align:middle line:84%
your cortisol is either
high or low or both

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.410 align:middle line:84%
within the same day, and
your thyroid is probably off.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Over the age of 40,
there's this problem

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:84%
of thyropause, which becomes
more common, 15 times more

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.217 align:middle line:90%
common in women than men.

00:50:39.217 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thyropause?

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:40.310 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Thyropause, so
it's where you see the typical

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
symptoms of a slow thyroid,
and it can be kind of gradual

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:51.060 align:middle line:84%
for women, so weight gain,
fatigue, hair loss, moodiness,

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.390 align:middle line:84%
especially depression,
low sex drive, brain fog.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:51:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So for women of a certain age,
we're talking here 35 to 50,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.674 align:middle line:84%
it's very common to notice that
you don't have the same focus.

00:51:03.674 --> 00:51:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
same attention.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have more
piles around your house.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay on task the way
that you used to stay on task.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.844 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's not
necessarily thyroid related?

00:51:13.844 --> 00:51:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: It
could be thyroid,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.220 align:middle line:84%
but the important point here
is to address the hormones.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of women
start making lists.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They start to get obsessive
about writing things down

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.560 align:middle line:84%
because they are convinced
that they are developing

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.370 align:middle line:84%
early Alzheimer's,
but I just want

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to say this is
probably perimenopause.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.410 align:middle line:84%
You want to get your
hormones into balance.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't reach for the
latest ADD medication

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
because there's a good chance
that the problem is hormonal.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:43.722 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And don't reach for the
extra sugar or the extra food

00:51:43.722 --> 00:51:44.222 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yeah,
that's not going to work.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's not
going to work, either.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.046 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Kale, wild
Alaskan salmon, quinoa,

00:51:50.046 --> 00:51:50.920 align:middle line:90%
that's going to work.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:90%
That's very helpful.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so what is
your daily protocol like,

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the Gottfried
Protocol in your life?

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.450 align:middle line:90%
What do you do in the morning?

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, I
get up before my kids,

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and I try to have at least
a few minutes of attunement.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Sanity.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: Sanity.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I do
just one yoga pose.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm a yoga teacher,
so I will often

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.510 align:middle line:84%
do yin yoga in the morning,
just like a sacral release,

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:84%
just one pose to just kind of
set the intention for my day.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I honestly think of
the arc of my day

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
as very similar to planning a
yoga class in that I start off

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:84%
with an intention, I
build to an apex pose,

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and then I have a warm
down to shavasana.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of how
I architect my day.

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I then have breakfast
with my children

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.260 align:middle line:90%
and take them to school.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.280 align:middle line:90%
That's very important to me.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I hit it hard in
terms of work for about six

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.682 align:middle line:84%
to seven hours, and then pick
them up from school again.

00:52:54.682 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then that's
towards the end of your day.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:58.669 align:middle line:84%
You make dinner
and close your day.

00:52:58.669 --> 00:52:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: I do.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I eat every
four to six hours.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.519 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very important.

00:53:03.519 --> 00:53:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What do you eat?

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.726 align:middle line:90%
>> GOTTFRIED: What do I eat?

00:53:05.726 --> 00:53:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So breakfast, I'm really
good at breakfast.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say my best
eating keeps banker hours,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and so starting
with breakfast, I'll

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.630 align:middle line:84%
either make a smoothie,
a green smoothie.

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I think of kale as a
lifestyle, not a vegetable,

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:24.870 align:middle line:84%
so I often will make green
smoothies with my Vitamix.

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes
will make porridge,

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.030 align:middle line:90%
especially in the winter time.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll make quinoa flakes
with some hemp seeds and--

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is there any conflict
with kale and thyroid?

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard that?

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: So raw kale
might have what's called

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.510 align:middle line:90%
a goitrogenic effect.

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It can sometimes slow
down the thyroid.

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I actually reviewed all
the evidence on this

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote my book, and I
was underwhelmed, honestly,

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:52.180 align:middle line:84%
on the raw vegetables and
their effect on the thyroid.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that it's
such a powerful effect,

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we don't have
the best evidence on it.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Soy actually had some
stronger evidence,

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and so I tend to recommended
that you limit soy

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to twice a week if you
have any thyroid issues.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so kale,
not a big offender.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Juicing it, probably fine.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.124 align:middle line:84%
So you start your day with kale
shakes, maybe some porridge.

00:54:16.124 --> 00:54:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Afternoon-- and you
said banker's hours,

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
so you pretty much stop
eating around 4:00?

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Well, what I
mean is that I am so good about

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:90%
my food at breakfast.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a really
nourishing lunch.

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I typically will have most
of my carbs at breakfast,

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll have protein and
vegetables at lunch and dinner.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm agnostic when it comes
to food plans for people.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I eat meat, but I don't think
that everyone needs to do that.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.860 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying about
the banker's hours

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.810 align:middle line:84%
is that I get a little looser
at night, probably because I'm

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.840 align:middle line:84%
making dinner for my
husband and for my children.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not quite
as strict at night,

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and I sometimes need
to rein that in.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, so now do you eat
a larger meal in the middle

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of the day and a smaller
meal at night traditionally?

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: I try to eat more
at lunchtime than at dinner.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the hormones
that it helps

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:13.050 align:middle line:84%
with to do that is
leptin, so leptin's

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:17.020 align:middle line:84%
a really important hormone
made in your fat cells.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And just as you can
become insulin resistant,

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and your cells become
numb to insulin,

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.190 align:middle line:90%
you can become leptin resistant.

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so the body
doesn't know when to be full?

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GOTTFRIED: Yes, there's
no signal telling you to stop

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:29.850 align:middle line:90%
eating.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.266 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So regular
eating habits,

00:55:31.266 --> 00:55:33.591 align:middle line:84%
and all of the habits that
you talk about are so very

00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:36.410 align:middle line:84%
You can read about them
in the "Hormone Cure."

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.380 align:middle line:84%
This was like having a doctor's
visit in the middle the day.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:45.990 align:middle line:84%
