00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
This is Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So when life completely
changes and every single thing

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that you know gets
uprooted, what do you do?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, intuition expert and
bestselling author Sonia

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Choquette, she went on a walk.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
A long walk.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:90%
A 1,000-mile walk.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Her brother and father died
and a long marriage ended,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and she packed up and walked
the Camino de Santiago.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Is a spiritual
pilgrimage spanning

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
500 miles over the Pyrenees
Mountains of Northern Spain.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
She did it twice, and
she's joining us now

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:90%
to share her journey.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SONIA CHOQUETTE: I'm so
happy to be back, Lisa.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My goodness, so
much has happened since I

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:90%
spoke with you last on Gaiam.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The last time we
talked to you had just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.882 align:middle line:90%
completed your first Camino.

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I'd
just completed it,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was still
reorganizing, because walking

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the Camino changed me
on a cellular level.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
It was so profoundly healing,
and it also was so interactive

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
because every day something
that I experienced on the Camino

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
absolutely mirrored what
was going on inside of me.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Even for example, I went
and walked in silence,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:90%
but I did make one friend.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the only person I
really connected to,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:90%
his name was Patrick.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
name as my husband who

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd just ended my marriage
with, so right away it

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:90%
was like, really?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.862 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's back up a
minute, because the last time

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
you were here you had talked
about this beautiful spiritual

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
pilgrimage, which we're going
to talk about the history of.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And you said that you and
Patrick were getting back

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.121 align:middle line:90%
together, or working on it.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: That
was our intention.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
When I came back the
first time, Patrick

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
had asked me if I would
consider a reconciliation,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and I said, of course.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
to walk it together.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But he decided right
before we were to leave

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't where he was.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't where his heart was.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And so he decided not to go.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it was
a second chattering.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And yet, I wasn't surprised.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.634 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I
was to walk it again.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let me ask you about
that-- it wasn't a surprise--

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
because all of your books
have been on intuition

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and following your guidance.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that coming at all?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I
felt the ambiguity.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And yet, with intuition
it's not the future set.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:90%
You're just riding the waves.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But I could feel the waves
becoming morning congruent.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that
where I am in life

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and where my ex-husband
was in life at the time,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and where we had been for a
greater part of our experience

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%
together, wasn't congruent.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was devastated, because
I was involved and invested

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.291 align:middle line:90%
in keeping my marriage together.

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You were moving
in that direction.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was
moving in that direction.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
intuition is I could feel it,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and I knew that it was right.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean it
was OK or it felt good.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
When you know something
intellectually,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't exonerate you
from feeling things deeply.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I just had to
embody yet another death.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I chose to
walk the Camino again.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the history
behind the Camino de Santiago?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Well it's a history that
goes back so far that it even

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:84%
goes back prior to what is
now known as the Camino.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's thousands of
years old, and it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is known as all these roads--
because the one I walked

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is only one of several
different roads, paths--

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that all converge and eventually
lead to Santiago, which

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:90%
means St. James in Spanish.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And the legend is that that is
where the bones of St. James

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the Apostle were buried, and
that St. James took his mission

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to Spain and this is
where the Pilgrims would

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
go to ask for forgiveness, to
forgive others in their life,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and to purify their
heart and spirit.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back
thousands of years,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and it has been
traveled by millions.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a mystery
at the end of it there?

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Where you said the legend is,
that his bones were buried

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
there, was there some
type of a miracle

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that happens at that rock?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well,
apparently what happened

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
was that a farmer or someone
in Spain found this grave,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and it was marked as
the bones of St. James.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that before it was that path,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Celts also
traveled that path.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.887 align:middle line:84%
So it's legend to follow lay
lines, or energetic lines--

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Grids.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And also
to follow the Milky Way.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, whatever
it is, it's not of this earth.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's deeply,
deeply spiritual.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.896 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It's a
different frequency.

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.311 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It is.

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not normal.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When do you start
to attune to that frequency?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I suppose
it's unique for everyone.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I felt it the first
day when I walked it,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
because I trashed my
feet having not prepared

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:90%
and broken in my boots.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And my toes were so devastated,
but I could still walk.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
How I even got my boots on.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And I
remember one day I woke up

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.271 align:middle line:90%
and I decided, I'm done.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:36.895 align:middle line:90%
I'm outta here.

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:90%
I was planning my escape.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And I go to breakfast and
there was a man, and he said,

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
the greeting is
always "buen camino,"

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:90%
which means have a good way.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.705 align:middle line:90%
And so he said, buen camino.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm leaving.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh, no you're not.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I am.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, no you're not.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.916 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
breakfast and you're

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:90%
going to keep walking.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, don't
you feel like this?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.319 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, every day.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm like this every day, but
we're going to keep going.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And I never saw him again.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I swear he was an angel.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And just that 30
seconds of exchange,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I was able to make
it another day,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and then-- there's
something about it

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that just, at least
for me, compelled me.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken with
other pilgrims,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.737 align:middle line:84%
and they all agree--
something happens.

00:07:38.737 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, did you have
breakfast with that man,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.564 align:middle line:90%
or did you keep--

00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you didn't
even have breakfast?

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.088 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: No, we didn't
even have breakfast.

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
He was leaving and I was
coming, and that was that.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was it, just
a 30 second interaction?

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was just the
way he said it, "Oh no, you're

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:90%
not going.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.345 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel like that, too."

00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a look here

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.511 align:middle line:84%
at the visual images that are
so beautiful of Sonia walking

00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:90%
the Camino.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.234 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: My name
is Sonia Choquette,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and for the last 30 years
I've been a spiritual teacher

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and for the last 20 I've
been a published author.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken to people all
over the world, inspiring them,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
helping them, lifting them up.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And I have loved it.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything was going well
until a few years ago.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
In the course of six weeks my
brother died, my father died,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
my marriage imploded, and my
life as I knew it fell apart.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I taught thousands of
people around the world.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who was
lifting people up,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't understand why
I couldn't lift myself up.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.215 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't be
happening to me.

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I received the
guidance that I was

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
supposed to leave everything
behind and walk a pilgrimage.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The Camino de
Santiago, also known

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.465 align:middle line:84%
as the Way of St. James,
the Way of Forgiveness.

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
My pilgrimage began not
just looking at a mountain

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but at a mountain
range, and it felt

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
like the mountain of old stuff.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It was overwhelming.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:25.924 align:middle line:84%
It was spring, almost June, and
the second day of my pilgrimage

00:09:25.924 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:90%
it snowed.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And so now I had to walk through
mud and muck and ice and cold,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
just like all the
pieces of my life

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that I had not yet
fully healed from.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Step by difficult step,
something really big

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.760 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Old emotions that
I had shoved aside

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
started breaking up,
moving on, and giving me

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
a little more freedom.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness started
coming back, and one step

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
at a time pieces of me that
I didn't even know I had lost

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%
started coming back.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And more and more, I started
to feel grounded, healed.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
More and more, I walked
myself back into the most

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.398 align:middle line:84%
profound level of wholeness that
I have ever experienced or knew

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:29.326 align:middle line:90%
was possible in my life.

00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I walked home.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you did this
not once but twice.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said in the beginning
you walked 1,000 miles,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
but one day at a time.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: One day at a time.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you hit
that place of silence,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
when you got to the place
of being in complete silence

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.692 align:middle line:90%
and you said you met Patrick.

00:11:06.692 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:90%
That was the second time.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: On my first Camino.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.493 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, the first one.

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: On
the first Camino.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
interesting thing is

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that what took me to
the Camino, and what

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I think is so important, is
that I'm a spiritual person

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:90%
and I have been all my life.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But I had all these emotions
that were not spiritual.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Anger.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the two deaths--
my brother who died,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
he had a lot of
trouble with drugs.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But while he was
alive, I accepted.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I understood.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
But after he died, I was angry.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
These were emotions
that I had pushed aside,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
because I'm spiritual.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I was angry with my father,
because he really never

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
supported or witnessed me.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
alive, I understood.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was so angry
with my husband.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet, an angry woman is
not an acceptable woman.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'd put all
these emotions away,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
but after all this death and
loss, they came exploding up

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
where to put them.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's what took
me on the Camino.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Both times, because
the second time

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I went I was to go
with my husband,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and we were to reconnect.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And right before we did,
he had another choice.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And I understood.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But I had all these
emotions still.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great point.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
How do you have that
spiritual awareness,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
where you're accepting
of all things,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and still hold on-- or
not hold on, but express--

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Feel and express.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Feel my human experience.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So the brilliance
of the Camino is

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to walk
with my own experience,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
walk with my emotions,
and be present to them.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.892 align:middle line:84%
And in being present, they
transformed naturally.

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
think that you could

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
have that experience of
expressing that anger

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
without walking the Camino?

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: For me,
without having some way

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to move that energy
through us and really

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
be present without shame and
guilt and trying to package it

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and rise above it with
our spiritual tools--

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
just be with our
human experience.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We can walk around the
block, walk on the beach,

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
but move with the energy.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Be with the energy.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
For me was so healing,
because eventually that energy

00:13:52.480 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
was heard and received, and it
deepened my compassion for me.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was heard
and received by you?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: By me.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you walked,
what was the mind chatter?

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Was it physical expression?

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was
a process that had

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:90%
kind of a rhythm of its own.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, the pain of
just getting my boots on.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Then getting in the road.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel
the exuberance.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I would walk and
then all these emotions.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were from when
I was a child or a teenager--

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that I'd forgotten--
would rise up.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I would walk
with that, and then

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.185 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to the
Camino and the Camino

00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:37.546 align:middle line:90%
would talk back to me.

00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I would
say, what is this

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and why is this happening?

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.715 align:middle line:90%
And the Camino would be present.

00:14:45.715 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It had its own
consciousness, and it

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:90%
would just, say just listen.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Just be with yourself.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Be with your experience.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And some days I would
yell at it and some days

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that I would just
be shown a place

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to sit and watch the water,
or sit and lay on the ground.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
There was this very intimate
interaction with where I was,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and everything was alive.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- the road, the
road, the trees, the rocks--

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
it was all alive.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it
moved through me.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And what was left
by around noon--

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple more hours to
walk-- was quiet in my head.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was just present and
just watching and walking,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
because I had to make sure
I didn't fall down, and just

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.629 align:middle line:90%
be present.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was part
of what was so healing.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was
that quietness like?

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.766 align:middle line:84%
There was no more mind
chatter, there was no outside--

00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Nothing.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:90%
my mind wasn't talking.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It was just being here.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:90%
And I can still go there now.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can?

00:15:58.605 --> 00:15:59.355 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah.

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It changed me.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And it changed me because I was
able to feel all my feelings

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and not be ashamed.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Spirituality has a shadow side.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.156 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yeah.

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: We're
clever people,

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're supposed to--
you're having a pain?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, you created that.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:90%
You're having a pain?

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's your karma.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've always felt that
shadow side was unfair.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We can't experience life without
pain, because it's temporary.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It will be painful.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you go forward
now and experience pain?

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.628 align:middle line:84%
What's your
relationship to it now?

00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I embody all
of my emotions now as holy,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:90%
and I don't fear them.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't fear pain.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't fear my anger.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't wallow in
it, but I listen,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and I honor it this is part
of my human experience.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you still get
triggered or lit up by things

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:90%
that your husband does now?

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, I
have no contact with him.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
We're on separate paths.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:90%
But I can get very triggered.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm psychic.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensitive.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:90%
Energy affects me.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But at least now I can
let it move through me,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and I can be with it and I can
be compassionate with myself

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and say, I have to
value my sensitivity.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a sacred cow, but
I have to love that part of me.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then when I love
that part of me and say,

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
what is this about--
because I've always

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
been comfortable loving
everyone else-- it was me

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that was the challenge.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So with my triggers
now, I know that there's

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
just something there, I need to
love for me a little bit more.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
still the same in terms

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of your intuition,
your sensibility,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
your sensitivities,
but you're just

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:90%
looking at things differently.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: The biggest
shift for me is now

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that I have had
such a connection

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
with my own emotions,
I feel that my capacity

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to have compassion for all human
beings has grown exponentially.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:90%
The human journey is painful.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
We are so sensitive as humans.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
We deny it, but we're
still sensitive.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And I feel with people at a deep
level, and I can be with people

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and not buffer myself
from my own pain or yours.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I can be present.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is huge for me.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What you just
said is so honest and raw.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
The human journey is painful.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.264 align:middle line:84%
We don't like to
say that, do we?

00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And especially in any
spiritually context,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
we like to be clever and
outsmart that people.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:90%
But we can't.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And intellectualize
it, or heal it.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Or heal it.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it just is what it is.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just is pain.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And
pain is holy, too.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe the
quicker you accept it,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:90%
the quicker it leaves.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it doesn't
need to leave.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well I
know for me, grief.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And that's
another feeling people are not

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:90%
that available to.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:90%
We have to get over our grief.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm in grief.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
My marriage ending--
I'm grieving still.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.657 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean I'm possessed.

00:19:30.657 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're not
quick to get over it.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But it
has its own cycle.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I can only be with it.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Part of being with it
is you moved to Paris.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I had
this inspiration.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Actually it was my daughter, who
saw me in such grief, and said,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Mom, you need a
change and you need

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to go where you remember who
you are before the marriage.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And I love France.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I lived there.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a deep connection
to the Magdalene.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.232 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, the--

00:20:07.232 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Deep connection
to Mary Magdalene,

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and I know my roots have
been traced back there.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
So it just was right.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a plan.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm just listening.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the other thing,

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that since I walked
the Camino two times--

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Two times.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:27.954 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:20:27.954 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I don't have plans.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I know God has plans
for me, that if I agree

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%
can be expressed through me.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And so my mind is a lot
quieter and peaceful.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not planning ahead.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For the first time?

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%
You seem excited about this.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It's
such a sweet space.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you are, in the
meantime, teaching tools.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Still in the meantime
as you learn them, you--

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I know
I'm here to teach,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and I know that you
cannot really be effective

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
as a teacher if you haven't
really experienced pain

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and what other
people experience,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and if you haven't really walked
your talk, at least for me.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful that
I can teach this.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful that I can share
with people the encouragement

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to not be ashamed of
your vulnerabilities,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and not feel like what
spiritual is to get over them.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's very well said.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have probably more to
teach now than you ever have.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Absolutely.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had great
intuition information,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
but this comes from a
totally different place.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And I think
it merges with intuition,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
because it is the feminine side.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But it dives into life
and says, if we are really

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
going to heal our planet and
find compassion for one another

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and stop living in such
an insane detachment

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
from humanity, that we hurt
each other the way we do,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:90%
we have to feel.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And we have to quit
getting away from that.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If we don't feel pain, how will
we ever also feel compassion?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that a small community

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual teachers,
and the community

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is small, of
personal development

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
teachers-- maybe there's

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
several thousand--
that's very small.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Even if there's
100,000, it's small.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we can
make that big of a dent?

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I think we are,
and I think every conversation

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:90%
ripples.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
where those ripples go.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I shared this with you.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the communal
once before, my first journey.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I went again,
there were so many people

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that I ran into who recognized
me from our conversation.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.010 align:middle line:90%
They saw the video.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were from
all over the world.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From seeing it on Gaiam.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.385 align:middle line:90%
That wonderful.

00:22:57.385 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And
I was so touched.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.181 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:02.075 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was so
humbled, and I was so excited.

00:23:02.075 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It hits a nerve.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: These
conversations,

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and this opening of energy,
has a big power behind it.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you take
a look at some of the videos

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.644 align:middle line:84%
that Sonia does with
teaching some of the tools

00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
she's learned along the way.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Hi,
I'm Sonia Choquette,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and I want to welcome you
first of all to my web page.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And especially to
this part, which

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:84%
is a conversation about
readings and what they involve.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all the
time, what is a reading?

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:90%
What will I experience?

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:90%
What will I receive out of it?

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.225 align:middle line:84%
Those are very good
questions, and I'm here

00:23:44.225 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to just demystify that
a little bit for you.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I am a spiritual
teacher and an intuitive guide.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So in a reading,
you will both be

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
shown a bit of the way
in your life experience

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and be given lessons to
improve your life experience.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:84%
You can bring any
sorts of issues.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
People wonder, well, why
would I get a reading?

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We reach for readings when we're
at those junctions in our life

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:84%
where we're really
stuck or where

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:84%
we need some inspiration
or fresh insight,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
or a perspective, that would
allow us to move forward.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I help people with emotional
issues, relationship issues,

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
financial issues, work issues,
purpose in life issues,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.700 align:middle line:84%
health issues-- any
challenge that you have.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Connecting with me,
I connect to source

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and I connect to the guides--
both mine and yours--

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're shown sort of
the blueprint of your life,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
your soul intentions,
your purpose,

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
as well as your blind
spots and your lessons,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:84%
which are very difficult for
us to recognize and really

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
move through with
grace unless we

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
do have some sort of guidance.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So I serve as the one who
puts light on your path,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
gives you direction, helps you
bypass, or avoid, the repeating

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
obstacles that you keep running
into or you keep creating,

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and show you another way.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I will also help you
connect with your guides

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and your higher
self, which can then

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
begin to make decisions
that serve you

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
rather than your lower self--
or your emotional self,

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
or your wound itself-- which
may be trying to protect you,

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
but isn't doing a very
good job of it and,

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
most likely, alienating
everyone else in the process.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
A reading takes
about 30 minutes,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
if you want to just
have a quick overview.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Or we can go into a
little more depth.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
We can have an hour
reading, in which case

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
you can explore
things and become

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better informed.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I also do what's
called transmissions.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I work so much
with the guided realm,

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually am shifting and
elevating your vibration,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and reconnecting you with
your own authentic self,

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:84%
clearing away some of the
cords and the connections

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and the patternings
and the attachments

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that have accumulated
in your life

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and prevent you from living
your most yourself, your most

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
authentic divine self, and
making choices from that place.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's an energetic
shift that occurs.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's very positive
and really helps

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you feel that you are
living in alignment

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:84%
with the you you really want to
be at the most profound level.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
It's informative, practical,
grounded, realistic,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but energetically uplifting
and healing to have a reading.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really good at it.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I really do a good job
of helping you get back

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
on the path that you
want to get and create

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.310 align:middle line:90%
the life you want to live.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to
have the experience.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:90%
You will absolutely love it.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
In that short period of
time, everything can change.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, it's not there
we have that many problems,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:84%
but if we don't know
how to address them

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
they cause that
many difficulties.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we learn our lessons,
we shift ourself from problem

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to solution, which is what
I do, life becomes a joy.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that I can be of
service to you in that way.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all along the Camino
and along the areas where

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
you would have to go
at night, did you ever

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:90%
know where you were staying?

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.569 align:middle line:90%
Some people--

00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I did.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did?

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:90%
You made reservations.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I made those
choices to stay at little

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:84%
houses where people
would take in the--

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.071 align:middle line:84%
So people give up their house
for a certain period of time,

00:27:48.071 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: They just
welcome us as pilgrims.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And they treat us as
something very holy.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It's just so humbling.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And they feed you,
and they're kind.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.530 align:middle line:90%
They're receiving.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And some help
you soak your feet.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
albergues, if you

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
want that experience, where
everybody rents a bed in rooms.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's 30
pilgrims all in a room,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and you're all together.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You all sleep together, and
then you get up in the morning

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:90%
and out the door at dawn.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.290 align:middle line:84%
The reason I didn't
do the albergues

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
is because the amount of
availability in the albergues

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
is limited, so people
get up really early

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and they end of
running to the next one

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to make sure they get their bed.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:90%
First of all--

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's stressful.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: --I
destroyed my feet,

00:28:43.538 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:90%
so that was not even an option.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I was in so much pain
and it's a miracle

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I would make it from one city
to one town or one village.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It was 25 kilometers,
26-- just about 18 miles.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I couldn't run.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't compete.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So I just would stay
at my little pensions.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I planned it.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who didn't, and we still

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:90%
ended up at the same places.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can show
up with no plans,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and you will be absolutely fine.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Between the first
one and the second one--

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.884 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first one
you had snow and rain--

00:29:27.884 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: And cold.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.725 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
was blisteringly hot.

00:29:31.725 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:90%
You had the opposite.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Same time of
year, blisteringly hot.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, of course.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't have the same
experience, because we never

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
have a same experience.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So again, every day was a very
different meeting of myself

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.475 align:middle line:84%
and meeting of God and
meeting of earth and meeting

00:29:55.475 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
of the moods of nature,
and I was very humbled

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's miles
and miles stretches

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.365 align:middle line:84%
where there's no shade,
no covering, whatsoever.

00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:07.115 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: None.

00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:90%
No shade at all.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:90%
That's called the Masada.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the middle part, and that's
where most of your deepest,

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
buried, unwitnessed,
not honored,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.300 align:middle line:90%
incomplete experiences come out.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Parts of yourself
come back together again.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And that
to me is the healing.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
You reconnect to your fragments.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:90%
You call them back home.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The people that
you met along the way,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
as you would see someone
maybe in a healing crisis,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:84%
would the healer part of
you want to help that person

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:90%
or honor them?

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I would
always be willing to help,

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and there was always-- if
anything, anybody in a healing

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:84%
crisis had absolutely more
help than they probably really

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
could manage.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But there was many times
where what I was able to offer

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.335 align:middle line:84%
was like a pair of
shoes or a jacket.

00:31:11.335 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why
am I bringing this?

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:90%
This is too much.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it would be for
someone that I-- intuition,

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'll know it right
in the front of my brain,

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
intuition is you move
and do without thinking,

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:84%
trusting that that
will all make sense.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Even when I went with
way too much stuff,

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I ended it with almost
nothing, because it

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:84%
was necessary at some point
to give it away to someone

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
who really needed it.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
would suggest people

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:90%
go with in the beginning?

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You said you hadn't enough
miles in your shoes.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Boots
that you broke in.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Be sure to do that.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:56.815 align:middle line:84%
And very little else--
two shirts, a sun shirt,

00:31:56.815 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
a very good hat, a
poncho, walking poles.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.785 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you wash your
socks along the way?

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You can hang them on your
backpack and they'll dry.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're staying
at a little place,

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you could just
hang them on the balcony.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I would put them
on my blow dryer

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and they would fill
up like a balloon.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
They're wool socks, so
they dried very quickly.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it expensive
to go on the Camino?

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I really
worked this out.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're really going to
indulge yourself and have

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful experience, you can
do that for about $35 a day.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And you
really are having it all.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
You can bring that
back to about $20, $25,

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:90%
but that would really cover it.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you could walk
any distance that you choose.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: You choose.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I chose to walk over 35 days,
but you can walk twice as long

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and go half as far, depending
on what is your calling.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you get
there, does your calling

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:90%
change and morph along the way?

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: The Camino is a
very interactive experience.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
You are having a direct
experience with sacred energy

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and mother nature, and so
every day it will inform you.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.154 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it a
walking meditation

00:33:36.154 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that you would do every
day, or would you ever

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.850 align:middle line:90%
sit and actually do a full?

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.439 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: No, I
was always walking.

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Part of the way is
because if I would

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
sit-- I would pause
occasionally--

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.220 align:middle line:84%
but when I stopped it was
so hard on my feet to get

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.710 align:middle line:90%
going again that I'd just go.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.755 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't go fast.

00:33:55.755 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You walked
at a very good pace.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.796 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I walked
and looked and listened.

00:33:59.796 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a look here

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:84%
at another piece
where Sonia is doing

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:90%
an active meditation with us.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.007 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:06.007 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Today
I want to offer you

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
a tool that will help
you calm your mind

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
and soothe the waters
of your emotions

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and help give you a little space
so you don't feel overwhelmed,

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:84%
and help you come back
to your true nature--

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.764 align:middle line:84%
your spirit and
your inner guidance.

00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool I call
instant meditation.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I'd
like to ask you to do

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
is think about all the
conditions in your life

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and how they're affecting you--
tugging, pulling, pushing you

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:90%
around, overwhelming you.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, as if you're
in the middle of a movie,

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a breath
in through the nose

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale as though you're
blowing out a birthday candle

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to release as you

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
do this all that energy shifting
and tugging and pulling on you,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Exhale until you
empty your belly.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And then next, breathe
in through the nose.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you'll
notice that you can actually

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
breathe into the full
cavity of your body,

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
into your solar plexus,
into your heart space.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And then let out the
sound, [SIGHING].

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that,
imagine your inner self

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:84%
expanding from your spinal
column all the way up.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to
open up and push

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the energy in all six directions
out, filling you with light.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do this again,
breathing in, releasing, in,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHING].

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your higher self
expanding above and below you,

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:90%
north and south, east and west.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And then just breathe
for a moment or two

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
here, imagining that your
mind is quiet, but listening.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are
calm, non-reactive,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and you have access
to your higher

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:90%
self, who oversees everything.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Just a few breathes
in this space

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.206 align:middle line:90%
gives you room to breathe.

00:36:34.206 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It's instant meditation.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.480 align:middle line:84%
You can do this with eyes open
or shut, but in either case

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
everything comes back into
perfect, peaceful alignment.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is your
tool for the day.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I know you'll love it, and
I send you all my love.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so can
you tell me how

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
this has changed, if
any way, your teachings

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.707 align:middle line:84%
around intuition, around
listening and following

00:36:59.707 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:90%
your guidance.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.470 align:middle line:84%
You said something
to me so powerful

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
the last time we interviewed
you-- or I interviewed

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you; me and my guides-- that
intuition, living without it,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.979 align:middle line:84%
is like living in a room
without the lights on.

00:37:13.979 --> 00:37:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Right.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that stuck with
me for so long, because it

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
is always with us, no matter if
we pay attention to it or not.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Right.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have your
teachings changed at all?

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: My
orientation has shifted.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I will always be a
teacher of intuition.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But our world is a
very lonely world,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and with our phones and
all of our little gadgets

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that keep us shifting away
from our feeling body,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:90%
it's getting lonely.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see what
you're saying.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And
what I want to do

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
is help offer
people an invitation

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to re-enter their feeling
body, and not run away from it,

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and not judge it, and not fear
that their feelings are bigger

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:84%
than their spirit,
because I truly

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
believe that our world
needs to learn to love.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But how can we love
another if we're

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:90%
so buffered that we can't feel?

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're a bunch of talking
heads, little bump cars,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
these ideals and what

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I call the kumbaya moments,
and we all say, oh, I love you

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and namaste.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's really
feeling the connection

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:84%
with another human being at
that deep, compassionate level,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and we have to go back there.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
level of compassion

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that we'll feel with
nature and with animals

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and with the whales, where
we're not watching it

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:84%
like we're at the zoo, and
life's there, and oh wow,

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
interesting, but we're
in the experience

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:84%
of our full human self,
Listening to our spirit guide

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and teach us how to become
more conscious and more sane,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.520 align:middle line:90%
loving human beings.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
point, because when

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
you do have that
connection with someone

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
we look at it as
something that's

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:90%
unique or special or rare.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But to live in that state of
that connection, that deepness,

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
all the time is living in
full awareness, isn't it?

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it
requires courage.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.151 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: First of
all, the word courage

00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
comes from the French word
"coeur," which is heart.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have a certain
strength and availability

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
to be present to
the human experience

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and to find real, genuine
availability to other people

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows you
to genuinely hear them,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:90%
genuinely care about them.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:84%
How can we do that if we
don't even hear and care

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.175 align:middle line:90%
about our own needs?

00:40:24.175 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because our mind is
taking us to the next moment,

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:90%
and beyond and beyond.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.681 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Right.

00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And our own needs-- we're
in a warrior culture.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.565 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught, be strong,
be stoic, get over it,

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:90%
rise above it.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Set goals.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But whatever
you do, don't need much,.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, as human
beings we need a lot.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We need nurturing, we need
love, we need compassion,

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:90%
we need space.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:90%
We need breath.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:90%
We need to be seen.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:90%
We need to be witnessed.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We need the freedom to
follow our intuition

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
without feeling like we have to
explain ourselves or hide it.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yet, you
don't appear to me

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
or come off as a needy person.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.494 align:middle line:84%
Even needing a man,
I don't see you--

00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference
between being needy, which

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:17.560 align:middle line:84%
means I am incomplete,
and having needs, which

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:84%
is, for my spirit to grow
it requires certain things,

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
just like plants need
earth and water and air.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:90%
All human beings need.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.685 align:middle line:84%
But when we say "needy," we
say "I need," slips into needy,

00:41:33.685 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:84%
then slips into shame, then
slips into get over it,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:84%
then slips into-- and
we've lost ourselves.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here to suggest
that perhaps if we could

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:84%
honor our needs and know
we're not incomplete,

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
but our garden and our
spirit needs to grow,

00:41:54.030 --> 00:42:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and we are not self-contained
units, and we need one another.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, in your life,
your daughter's with you.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:84%

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I have two daughters, and the
younger one moved with me.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Absolutely.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:90%
In fact, so much.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:84%
If you spend 32 years with
somebody and then they're gone,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.864 align:middle line:90%
it's a death.

00:42:19.864 --> 00:42:21.155 align:middle line:90%
It's a death to a whole matrix.

00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Again, here's the paradox.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.710 align:middle line:90%
My higher self understands.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:90%
My spirit accepts.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.290 align:middle line:90%
But my heart hurts.

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.749 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what do you do on

00:42:36.749 --> 00:42:38.831 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Would you
imagine what I do in Paris?

00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I walk.

00:42:40.098 --> 00:42:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I walk everywhere.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Walking is my medicine.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that's
my medicine is beauty.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I fill my painful
places up with beauty.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:84%
In Paris, the markets, the
architecture, the parks--

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.910 align:middle line:90%
it's so beautiful.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.635 align:middle line:84%
And I know that one of our
needs as humans is beauty.

00:43:03.635 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: That's my

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It puts you

>>CHOQUETTE: And presence.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I'm walking in
Paris, I have to pay attention.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
It compels me to notice
what's right in front of me.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I can feel this cycle of
grief that I'm going through,

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and I can respect it.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't deny it, but I
don't let it possess me.

>>LISA: You don't label
yourself with "I'm grieving."

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just aware
that I'm grieving,

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also joyful
at the same time.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And human beings are
complex, and I am inspired

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm present and
I know it's all OK.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:52.872 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you wrote this
book at the same time.

00:43:52.872 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.484 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me about
the power of journaling.

00:43:57.484 --> 00:43:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well,
the interesting thing

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is, when I went on
the Camino I had

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:02.840 align:middle line:84%
no intention of
writing a book, but I

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.340 align:middle line:84%
did have the intention of
not forgetting my experience.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I ended
up having a pocket recorder,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
record every day.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:90%
But I was so exhausted.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I had this plan to
record the whole day,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and I would manage maybe to get
five minutes, and then I'm out.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But that five minutes every
day drew me right back

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.250 align:middle line:90%
into the experience.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So I started writing, and it was
like walking it all over again.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was a
healing, healing experience.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.509 align:middle line:84%
It's very different
than my other books.

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That must have been
magical, to go through it--

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.508 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:44:41.508 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --all over again.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.959 align:middle line:84%

a different perspective?

00:44:44.959 --> 00:44:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Even writing
it, because I don't plan.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I just write.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And then it was like, yeah.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.086 align:middle line:84%
I miss that, but now I'm getting
that because I'm writing this.

00:44:55.086 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Aha.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was one

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.491 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well,
one of the moments

00:45:00.491 --> 00:45:02.210 align:middle line:84%
that was so profound
as I was writing

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:84%
this is I realized
how deeply I am

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:90%
in love with being in nature.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I loved it, but I didn't
realize how deeply I loved it,

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.410 align:middle line:90%
and how deeply I need that.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Chicago.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize--

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: City girl.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.650 align:middle line:84%

now I know that.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.380 align:middle line:90%
That's one big aha.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you were
out on the Camino

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:84%

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:90%
was it that drew them?

>>CHOQUETTE: I was so humbled.

00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:84%
They said they watched and they
said, I am going to do that.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk about that.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a calling.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.620 align:middle line:90%
It is a calling.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:90%

>>CHOQUETTE: Even when
I was called to do it,

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
much about it.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just made
the reservations?

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.545 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But that's
how I live intuitively.

00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I am that person who, when I
get a calling or I get a vibe,

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.450 align:middle line:90%
the answer is yes.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%

>>CHOQUETTE: No, but you can

Some of them, no.

They've gotten so
numbed out that life

took on sort of a rote routine

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.700 align:middle line:90%
There was no contact with life.

Some people came because they

>>CHOQUETTE: Well, it
can be all year around.

But the winter can
be pretty difficult,

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%

go in the late spring

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.840 align:middle line:84%
or you'll go in early fall,
because the summer can

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.861 align:middle line:90%
be intensely hot.

00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though you
went in the late spring?

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I went
in late spring,

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and it was intensely
hot the second time

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.860 align:middle line:84%
but it was snowing
the first time.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I also say,
whenever it is, just go,

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:84%
because it'll be the
perfect experience for you.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.240 align:middle line:90%
And I can promise you that.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.215 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I'm sure.

00:48:25.215 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It'll be
the perfect experience,

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.016 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
what it'll be.

00:48:29.016 --> 00:48:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
really, honestly,

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.950 align:middle line:84%
20 to 30 days out of
your life is nothing

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to just
transform your whole life.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And the
truth is, as souls, we

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:47.395 align:middle line:84%
need more time to just be
available to our spirits.

00:48:47.395 --> 00:48:47.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:47.895 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I think
it's not an indulgence,

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's a correction.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
make that time, you

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.345 align:middle line:84%
see the sanity of needing that
time, that it's so important.

00:49:01.345 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've built
that into your life now.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:03.928 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:49:03.928 --> 00:49:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, in my
move to Paris, every morning

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I probably walk three
hours before I do anything.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I just get up and walk
and go and explore

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.012 align:middle line:84%
and don't really
have a direction.

00:49:22.012 --> 00:49:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't power-walk.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:24.910 align:middle line:90%
You just go for the journey.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:25.576 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:49:25.576 --> 00:49:31.795 align:middle line:84%
I just stroll and explore and
watch and listen to my spirit.

00:49:31.795 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in a hurry
anymore, because I

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.470 align:middle line:90%
know there's nowhere to go.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:43.240 align:middle line:90%
I learned that.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no place to go.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.720 align:middle line:90%
There's just walking home.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:56.530 align:middle line:84%
There's just more presence to be
with myself, and be with life.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting paradox
of that is it stretches time.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:03.947 align:middle line:84%
I just seem to have
somehow a lot of time.

00:50:03.947 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you go
walking in the morning,

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.535 align:middle line:84%
you can still get back by
9:00 AM and have a full day.

00:50:08.535 --> 00:50:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And
still have a full day,

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and stay up until midnight
and have a full night.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so time-bound,
and I'm not

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.530 align:middle line:90%
fighting with timing anymore.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.142 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you
do that in the past?

00:50:24.142 --> 00:50:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was always
ambitious to do as much

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.660 align:middle line:84%
good in the world as I could,
and that made me very busy.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm not so
ambitious to do that.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
was very noble,

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.450 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't good for me.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And so now, my prayer every
day is, use me as you see fit.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.447 align:middle line:84%
And I'm available, but
I am going to relax.

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you still
get things done.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah,
as much as ever.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.680 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not stressed.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.796 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:50:56.796 --> 00:50:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I still write.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I still have my clients.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.410 align:middle line:90%
I still teach.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:03.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not in emergency.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.222 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is such
a difference right now

00:51:06.222 --> 00:51:07.430 align:middle line:90%
from what you just explained.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.261 align:middle line:84%
You still get the
same amount done.

00:51:10.261 --> 00:51:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But I'm
not in the, I'm late,

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm late, for a
very important date.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.466 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And not taking
that toll on your body.

00:51:15.466 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I really do think that's
why I feel really good.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And look about
10 years younger.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Not that you looked
old, but wow.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.218 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: People
say that, and I

00:51:26.218 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:84%
know that it's because I'm
not in that frequency that's

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:90%
so contracted.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.051 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Frequency and
chemical rays, and--

00:51:35.051 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:41.532 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
it'll all be OK.

00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It'll be OK.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to be managing.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.382 align:middle line:90%
It'll all be OK.

00:51:46.382 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you don't really
use your intuition a lot

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.266 align:middle line:90%
with that, as well.

00:51:50.266 --> 00:51:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Because when you say
yes to something--

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Only follow that.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.010 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes to an
appointment or something,

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.300 align:middle line:84%
instead of over-committing,
your intuition

00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.549 align:middle line:90%
comes in and tells you.

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Right.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
label that intuition

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:90%
from the higher source?

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: That's
my spirit and my guide

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:09.112 align:middle line:84%
and my higher self,
and heaven and nature.

00:52:09.112 --> 00:52:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all of it.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It's all of it.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: It's a
symphony of guidance.

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not just
one, even though you

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:90%
were raised Catholic.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.428 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:52:17.428 --> 00:52:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's still my
saints and angels,

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:20.880 align:middle line:90%
and they're all in there.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's not one god?

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:28.430 align:middle line:90%
God is so all that.

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All encompassing.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.970 align:middle line:90%
In every speck of nature.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what you listen to.

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.258 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:52:35.258 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And I do have to say, I'm
not talking in my head much,

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and I don't think.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I just listen and
feel the vibration.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's an inspiration.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it works.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right there
is an inspiration.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you still get
the same amount done.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Absolutely.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you set forward
goals for yourself?

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I used to.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.260 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
that's very interesting

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.470 align:middle line:90%
since my second Camino.

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I have no ability to
set any goals right now.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ability?

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I have no goals.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like, OK, I want
to just be here and show up.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And whatever shows
up, I'll trust that.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long ago
did you get back?

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:29.492 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I got back in July.

00:53:29.492 --> 00:53:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It's been a few months.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A little
over six months.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And you've been in
this space since then.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.885 align:middle line:90%
And no need to change?

00:53:36.885 --> 00:53:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I don't
feel the need to change.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.220 align:middle line:90%
I just feel grateful.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
you'll go back?

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I would
definitely go back again.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.827 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you ever lead
groups after you've done it?

00:53:47.827 --> 00:53:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I've been asked to.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I will
say it's possible,

00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not feeling that
calling at the moment,

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.160 align:middle line:84%
nor do I think people
need to be led.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I think you just show up.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why
I'm not feeling it.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel like your
spirit will lead you.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a
great, great point.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
need to be led, either.

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:14.739 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look here at one more

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:90%
video with Sonia Choquette.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.426 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:54:19.426 --> 00:54:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: One of the
most common questions

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that I am met with
by my students

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and clients is, how do I
attract more money into my life?

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I just seem like I can't quite
get into the prosperity flow.

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
you need to do

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is change your whole
relationship to money.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Rather than thinking
that it's something

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go after
and you have to struggle for

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and you have to work hard
for and the exchange is going

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:84%
to come to that way, come
back into your spirit,

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:56.530 align:middle line:84%
come back into your breath, and
begin to open up and practice

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:01.110 align:middle line:84%
becoming a better receiver,
because people who

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.720 align:middle line:84%
are prosperous have no
problem not only receiving,

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but expecting good things
and prosperity to come.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to start
is start paying attention

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to all the ways good
things are coming already.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
What have you received
today that was

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.550 align:middle line:84%
a blessing, that was abundant
that you did not expect?

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And say thank you out loud,
and make a game of it.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you received three
times today something

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.120 align:middle line:84%
you didn't expect
that was really good.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:40.090 align:middle line:84%
See if maybe it can happen four
times tomorrow, or five times.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.910 align:middle line:84%
See, the key is that you're
receiving all the time,

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:47.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually your awareness
and your conscience acceptance

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.820 align:middle line:84%
of what's coming your way
that will amplify your ability

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.360 align:middle line:90%
to make money.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's Part A.

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And Part B is, say
thank you a lot.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the gifts.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Say thank you to the universe.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to your friends.

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Thank you to anybody,
anywhere, anytime,

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:08.590 align:middle line:84%
bringing goodness to
you, because the more

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:11.345 align:middle line:84%
you receive goodness,
the more it amplifies.

00:56:11.345 --> 00:56:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to become an
energetic magnet to pull

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.430 align:middle line:90%
in more and more and more.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So first it might just
start in abundant gifts,

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:26.360 align:middle line:84%
abundant blessings,
but absolutely it

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.720 align:middle line:84%
will become eventually
abundant money.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's up to you.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not about a struggle.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not about going after.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not even necessarily
connected to "work"

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:90%
in the traditional way.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And then one final thing
when you do go to work,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:45.610 align:middle line:84%
let your expression
of being at work

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.340 align:middle line:90%
be a blessing to someone else.

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So rather than going to
work and resenting the day,

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.360 align:middle line:84%
or showing up with no energy
or not liking where you are,

00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:01.470 align:middle line:84%
show up to the day deciding that
no matter what happens today,

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:04.820 align:middle line:84%
in my work and in my
expression of my work I

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.390 align:middle line:90%
will be a blessing.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So whoever had anything
to do with the receiving

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.680 align:middle line:84%
end of my work will feel
better, will feel happy,

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.800 align:middle line:84%
uplifted, will feel good about
their experience of my work.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The twofold practice
will bring you

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.300 align:middle line:84%
into a higher and far more
prosperous, far more abundant--

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and in time, financially
abundant-- experience.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.202 align:middle line:90%
I think you'll be surprised.

00:57:34.202 --> 00:57:35.186 align:middle line:90%
All my love.

00:57:35.186 --> 00:57:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
just the inspiration

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that you are, because as
people watch your energy

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and how comfortable
you are, really truly,

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:84%
in your skin-- you're not
talking about 10 steps to being

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.780 align:middle line:90%
comfortable in your own skin.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.680 align:middle line:84%
You are comfortable
in your own skin.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I took 1,000 to
get comfortable in my own skin.

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 1,000 miles.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I'm
grateful to be here.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to share such an
intimate experience with you

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:90%
and with the people who watch.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just very humble.

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all a gift.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.477 align:middle line:84%
One thing I do know about life
is, it really is all a gift.

00:58:22.477 --> 00:58:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.202 align:middle line:90%
And you enjoy it.

00:58:24.202 --> 00:58:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And also,
recommends the Camino, yes?

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I recommend, if
you want an experience that

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:38.070 align:middle line:84%
will rejuvenate and call
all the pieces of you

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that you somehow had to
surrender for whatever

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.410 align:middle line:84%
unsafe moment that was,
and get them all back

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate all those glorious
pieces of you, this will do it.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:52.361 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.242 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sonia.

00:58:54.242 --> 00:58:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Thank you, Lisa.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.119 align:middle line:84%
I'm always honored
to be with you.

00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's my pleasure.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.909 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I'm very
grateful, thank you.

00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And just
to be so connected

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is such a beautiful-- I
love looking into your eyes.

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:04.888 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Thank you.

00:59:04.888 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
lot of journey there.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:10.570 align:middle line:90%
You can go deeply there.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I hope that you saw that too.

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.390 align:middle line:84%
