>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.386 align:middle line:84%
Bill Stierle is joining
me again today.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.622 align:middle line:84%
He is a communication
specialist and a mediator

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle line:84%
who has developed a link
between emotional intelligence

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.562 align:middle line:90%
and thinking styles technology

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.864 align:middle line:84%
through a brain dominance
model system.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.333 align:middle line:84%
And our show today is
talking about on how

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.937 align:middle line:84%
to implement this system
to increase communication

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.241 align:middle line:84%
between people in conflicts
in both home and at work.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.409 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to the show Bill.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.543 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill Stierle: Thanks
for another back again.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.446 align:middle line:84%
It's-- I feel grateful
for being here

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.881 align:middle line:90%
and sharing this information.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You have so much
information and what we talked

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.852 align:middle line:84%
about a little bit
before and I will touch

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.721 align:middle line:84%
on this again is the
brain dominants model.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.923 align:middle line:84%
So there're four
different quadrants

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.325 align:middle line:90%
that you've identified based

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.661 align:middle line:84%
on the Herrmann Brain Dominance
Model on how people communicate.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, the main
thing is to get use to is,

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
is that the front part of our
brain has this very logical

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.337 align:middle line:84%
and analytical part that
goes here that works

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:11.638 align:middle line:90%
from the upper left part.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.608 align:middle line:84%
And the upper right part of
the brain has this visual

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:18.979 align:middle line:84%
and this ability to think in a
holistic way and synthesizing,

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.515 align:middle line:84%
integrate the way
an artist does.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.984 align:middle line:84%
And then there is this
emotional part of our brain

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:28.588 align:middle line:84%
that really activates and allows
us to move into action when all

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.624 align:middle line:84%
of the emotion moves
inside our body.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.593 align:middle line:84%
And then there is this
lower left part of the brain

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.694 align:middle line:90%
that really puts things

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:37.297 align:middle line:84%
into order they does
lot of the time keeping.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.534 align:middle line:84%
And this metaphor, this very
strong metaphor allows us

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:45.172 align:middle line:84%
to talk about brain, brain
science in a way to bring it

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.475 align:middle line:84%
into a practical sense
both at home and at work

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle line:84%
and to really talked about
how we can best leverage

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.446 align:middle line:90%
our communication--

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- so
it goes better.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So-- And then, there's
different colors associated

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:90%
with this type of thinking.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:02.055 align:middle line:84%
So the blue color is more that
intellectual thinker, right?

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:02.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Uh-hmm.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And then?

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then the green
is more-- more this organized,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.862 align:middle line:84%
planned, detailed, and
sequenced style thinker.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.432 align:middle line:84%
The emotional part of
the brain kinesthetic,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.768 align:middle line:90%
feeling based style thinking--

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:15.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Is red?

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- is red.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.139 align:middle line:84%
And then, the yellow
part is synthesizing,

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.141 align:middle line:84%
integrating conceptual
style thinking.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Visual?

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Visual, big
picture of thinking.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:23.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK, great.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:25.245 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:29.216 align:middle line:84%
So now, how does this work where
you in say, a work environment

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.385 align:middle line:84%
and you want to learn
how to resolve a conflict

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.155 align:middle line:84%
to the co-worker who clearly
has a different way of thinking

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
in a different style of working.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well the--

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.858 align:middle line:90%
a big part of the last show

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.393 align:middle line:84%
that we did was we
really actually talked

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.329 align:middle line:84%
about the balance of
this different ones

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.432 align:middle line:84%
and different workers are going
to come from different places.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's going to
be some people, they're going

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.302 align:middle line:84%
to approach things from logical
place and some people are going

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:52.639 align:middle line:84%
to be approaching things
from an interpersonal place.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.408 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
appreciate the differences

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.712 align:middle line:84%
between those four
different values sets.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to also to be
able to manage the emotions

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that go along with those.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And not to judge that
person but to be accepting

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.223 align:middle line:84%
of that person and you
mention a very important word.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Appreciate
the differences.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Appreciate
the differences?

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: How can I
appreciate the differences

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.864 align:middle line:84%
and the sentences is that it's
not personal, its preference.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:18.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's it.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.332 align:middle line:90%
Uh-hmm.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And there's
a preference

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.004 align:middle line:84%
that this person thinks that
there're super power and then,

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.272 align:middle line:90%
all of this have are kryptonite.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Those things
that we're not very good at.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right, so,

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the show
last time you talk

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.382 align:middle line:84%
about this our limbic style of
thinking which is our old style

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.516 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, it's the
survival mechanism,

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:39.419 align:middle line:84%
it's the emotional
center of the brain.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, the back
part of the limbic part

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:44.491 align:middle line:84%
of our brain is really
built for a long term memory

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:48.528 align:middle line:84%
and emotional style of thinking
and it's built for safe keeping

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.464 align:middle line:84%
and this, I want to
really stay connected.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:55.769 align:middle line:84%
I want to use this inter--
this intuitive style feeling.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sense the
feelings of others and myself.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.173 align:middle line:90%
And where the newer part

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:03.777 align:middle line:84%
of our thinking is more the
logical part of the brain

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:84%
and the future orient
to brain and this part

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:09.883 align:middle line:84%
of our brain has 400,000
connections per micron

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:90%
of neuron connections.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:17.424 align:middle line:84%
And this part of the brain has
more a 4.3 million connections.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So there's a lot
more activity happening?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: A lot
more activity and--

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And the emotional and
the survival part of the brain?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that happens first?

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's the-- and
depending on the environment.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:84%
Our cells will actually
literally respond

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:40.213 align:middle line:90%
to a perceived or real threat.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Fear.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.415 align:middle line:90%
Fear and threats in thing--

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:42.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Fear--

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- is going to be an
emotion that is going to be one

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of those combinations of
neuropeptides inside our body.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is that why
the news, "If It Bleeds,

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.427 align:middle line:90%
It leads" is so popular--

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yes [multiple
speaker]--

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And violence in films.

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And boy,
very, very well stated.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.533 align:middle line:90%
Is news is very limbic.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's fed into the limbic
system so that if I am going

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.578 align:middle line:84%
to see something dangerous and
it's going to cause a fight,

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:14.447 align:middle line:84%
flight and freeze
response inside my body

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.982 align:middle line:90%
and I want to know what to do.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Even if
it's across the world.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Even
across the world.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Are they
causes [phonetic]--

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Then
all of a sudden,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.592 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
empathetic approach,

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:29.863 align:middle line:84%
it's going to trigger my limbic
part of the brain and I'm going

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.866 align:middle line:84%
to respond to it by
staying on the channel.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:33.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I'm going
to stay there.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:39.072 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stay on this
because this news is feeding

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:84%
into my fight, flight
and freeze.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that's what this--

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:45.678 align:middle line:84%
of the films do it that are
very action and violent,

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.715 align:middle line:84%
oriented films is they
keep the listener engaged

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
because it engages the
limbic system of the brain.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:56.256 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to engage from
scene to scene to find

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.858 align:middle line:84%
out what happens
with this character

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.762 align:middle line:84%
because my brain is
engaged into this fight,

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:90%
fight and freeze response.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Does the brain want
to organize it and resolve it?

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:84%
Is that why there are happy
endings are always good

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.904 align:middle line:84%
at the end of-- if the
movie ever ends there,

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:12.772 align:middle line:84%
you want to back
and watch it so--

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.275 align:middle line:90%
It's I want to end.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:18.278 align:middle line:84%
I want to be on the
roller coasted ride.

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:21.781 align:middle line:84%
And all this different chemicals
or these different molecules

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:24.884 align:middle line:84%
of the motion are moving
around my body and I am

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.253 align:middle line:84%
on the rollercoaster
ride and I'm--

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:31.958 align:middle line:84%
hoping that I have just
enough control of this

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.361 align:middle line:90%
to make sense of this.

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:40.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained to then make
meaning out of what I just saw.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:42.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I'm going to
make a meaning out of it.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's probably why
people love rollercoasters

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.173 align:middle line:84%
'cause they're always
on the edge of control.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:47.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:48.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Out of control.

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:50.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But knowing that
there's going to be end to it.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's right
and they've got trust

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
that so a movie is last of the
threat that a rollercoaster is.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because your
sticking your body into it.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yup.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.657 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting in a seat.

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:05.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know
you're sitting in a seat.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.227 align:middle line:90%
You know it's virtual.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, what is the study
that we are looking at here?

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.163 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at the slide.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a study that--

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Oh yeah, sure.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:12.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- was done about--

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:13.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Sure.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.634 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, about change.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.903 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the biggest thing
about change, it's very much

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:20.874 align:middle line:84%
like if you imagine of this part
of the brain is an elephant.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:22.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The back.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And this part of the
brain is little person sitting

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.078 align:middle line:90%
on top of the elephant.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:25.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: With the stick.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK?

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.549 align:middle line:84%
So this part of the brain,
the logical part in the future

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.252 align:middle line:84%
or I'm saying, yeah we
want to go somewhere.

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.221 align:middle line:84%
This is why a New Year's
resolution doesn't work so well.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:35.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work so well
because the limbic part

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:43.963 align:middle line:84%
of the brain defaults to what
you know or know what to be true

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.298 align:middle line:90%
or know what's a habit.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: So, if you grew

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:51.538 align:middle line:84%
up in your family eating
thanksgiving a certain way,

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:54.406 align:middle line:84%
the limbic part of your
brain remembers that.

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:59.746 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard for you
then to change the menu.

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So if you grew up
eating turkey and then you want

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:84%
to be vegan that
is going to be--

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:10.323 align:middle line:84%
so the brain stays into a
certain way of habitual thinking

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.925 align:middle line:90%
as a survival mechanism.

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:12.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And its--
and it's done on purpose.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why the
brain does it on purpose is

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.199 align:middle line:84%
because this part
of the brain is able

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.635 align:middle line:84%
to store more information
so you don't have

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.637 align:middle line:90%
to keep relearning things.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
OK. Usually, if you think about
driving a car and if you think

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.277 align:middle line:84%
about young person
driving a car,

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:35.748 align:middle line:84%
they try to drive
their car through this.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Logically
and specially

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.152 align:middle line:84%
and that's why their insurance
rates are higher 'cause they ran

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:40.719 align:middle line:90%
into crop.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.155 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:44.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Do too.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:47.527 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until
this thing has driven

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:52.265 align:middle line:84%
down into the limbic part of the
brain that it becomes habitual.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.934 align:middle line:84%
You and I do not need to learn
how to do right turn.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So-- So there
is no habitual pattern

00:08:57.236 --> 00:09:01.507 align:middle line:84%
that they base driving on and
they have to intellectualize it

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they do
crash into poles.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It is the
highest incidents

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.413 align:middle line:90%
of accidents is teenagers.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.485 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
spacial acuity or to ability

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.587 align:middle line:90%
to logical-- logically--

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, even if they
give them the car keys

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:90%
at 20, it's not going to

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.259 align:middle line:90%
create any different result.

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.661 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:22.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Lets take a look at
this next slide where is--

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.231 align:middle line:84%
this is where the-- or
you were just talking

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.899 align:middle line:90%
about this where the emotions.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:31.037 align:middle line:84%
In the emotions, what happen is
that when the emotions shows up,

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:84%
it'll actually knock us
out of logical thinking

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.108 align:middle line:90%
and locked us out of it.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:42.048 align:middle line:84%
This is why-- this is why
death sense is not a deterrent.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.551 align:middle line:84%
We have all this
things on the book

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.855 align:middle line:84%
that if you just have death
sentence that will deter people

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.089 align:middle line:90%
from killing each other.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.457 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:52.558 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.527 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it cost
millions to dollars

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.629 align:middle line:84%
to actually execute
the death sense.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:59.766 align:middle line:84%
It's cheaper to keep them
in jail for their life

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.168 align:middle line:90%
if they are a danger to society.

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:05.805 align:middle line:84%
It's cheaper to keep them
than to execute them.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.507 align:middle line:84%
It's much more expensive
legally.

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:08.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Legally, so
it's not...

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So why is it not
a deterrent emotionally?

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:13.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Is not a deterrent
it because the emotional part

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:17.417 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and the safe
keeping part of the brain,

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:23.089 align:middle line:84%
if it makes it real
will shoot and realize--

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Later.

00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:26.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- after that
that wasn't such a good idea.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Let's talk about
in terms of relationships.

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Oh, yeah.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Where emotions to
take over a relationship or--

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.001 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about it
in parenting as well.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:35.635 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Sure.

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- where the emotions
will take over a relationship

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle line:84%
and not give you the
thinking ability to know

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:43.976 align:middle line:84%
if this person is right
for you or not, is that?

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.382 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that--
I'm connecting to this person

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:54.087 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
perceived to connection.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:59.025 align:middle line:84%
There's perceived that I'm
going to get a love-affection.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.729 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, the emotional
part of our brain is starting

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:06.365 align:middle line:84%
to move to-- in that direction
because it's perceived.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:84%
So, in-- Like in
our last show one

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.635 align:middle line:90%
of the things you talked about,

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
if there was a spider
crawling towards you.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, I'd
run out at the door.

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:13.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.508 align:middle line:84%
You're going to choose
a fight response.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now let's do
it the other way.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.113 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose the spider is
here and crawling towards me.

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:20.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I'm still running out.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.147 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.248 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now, you're
running out the door

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.618 align:middle line:84%
but I'm actually
watching and then go

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:29.822 align:middle line:90%
in like, is the danger real?

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask that question.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:90%
Well, not really real.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.261 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that I've
got three choices.

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Freeze is my first choice.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.931 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait
to see if it's going

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.833 align:middle line:84%
to crawl towards you
or crawl towards me.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:45.204 align:middle line:84%
Now, your body is actually
engaged in the physiology of it.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:48.941 align:middle line:84%
So, if you go to this slide
right here, the neuropeptides

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.745 align:middle line:84%
of anxious, nervous, worried,
scared are already showing

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:55.214 align:middle line:84%
up in your-- Lisa, there
is no spider there.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.017 align:middle line:84%
But it does-- your body
cannot tell the difference.

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:00.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You happen to pick
my biggest fear though.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:00.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It cool.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
OK. OK.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I mean, it will jump--

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, it's
crawling towards me.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.857 align:middle line:90%
So let me get rid for you.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:05.391 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa. OK.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:06.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Watch.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Let me watch, let me watch.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:12.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: A fight response if
the best response in this case.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
See, I just kill the
spider for your Lisa.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I can't do that.

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: I just step it.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:19.338 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't 'cause your
flight response is better.

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.974 align:middle line:84%
So your flight response is
a better choice for you.

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:84%
In these choices that if it's
moving or I could choose that

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
or I can help my
friend Lisa and go.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.682 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, I am glad I took
care of that spider

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.484 align:middle line:84%
for you even though
it's imaginary.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we take a look
at this next slide,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.154 align:middle line:90%
watch what happens here.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.557 align:middle line:84%
We could do on the
positive side of defense.

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:38.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:39.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: As the
audience reads this thing.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:40.893 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and read it.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.061 align:middle line:90%
What does it say?

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ice cream is good.

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.464 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of your two
favorite ice creams.

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:84%
Favorite-- What's your
first favorite ice cream?

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.302 align:middle line:90%
What's your favorite ice cream.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:50.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mint Chip.

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:51.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Mint Chip.

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.272 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's put two scoops of
Mint Chip in front of you.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.842 align:middle line:90%
Now, imagine it there.

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:56.409 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah-huh!

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK, good.

00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:00.079 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a scope of
it and it's just about ready

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:90%
to come in to your mouth.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, what Mint
Chip tastes like.

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:06.052 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you've kind of
like it, don't you?

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And two scoops
will be a really good idea.

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:09.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:10.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, that feels
really good, doesn't it?

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.158 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, two scoops
and you know maybe

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.693 align:middle line:90%
after the show we can go get--

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:14.894 align:middle line:84%
go get some ice cream
downstairs.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: 'Cause I know
that there's some downstairs,

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
so we can get some if you like.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, and if you
like, I can send you over some

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.634 align:middle line:90%
to your house and you can have--

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.236 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'll send you
even a gallon of it.

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nice.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I'll
be glad to do it.

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Now inside your body, your
physiology is changing.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.777 align:middle line:84%
Now think of the ice cream
and look at the slide

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.646 align:middle line:84%
and then hit the clicker,
watch what happens.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, that's interesting.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.583 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah. That's great.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Now, notice

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.187 align:middle line:84%
that there's a physiology
change 'cause I sort

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:43.522 align:middle line:84%
of just took the ice
cream away from you.

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:47.493 align:middle line:84%
Your body is looking at that
and trying to resolve the issue.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:84%
Because I just kept
putting this--

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- stimulus
is in the thought

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:52.164 align:middle line:90%
of I'm sending you ice cream.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I saw ice
cream cake in my mind.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And we're going to
get it downstairs and ice cream

00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and your physiology
is changing to it.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.173 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go backwards and
bring the screen back up.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:03.743 align:middle line:90%
Look at ice cream is good.

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:07.113 align:middle line:84%
Now watch how your physiology
will change just slightly.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:08.781 align:middle line:90%
You go like, you restored it.

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:90%
But wait, wait, wait.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.051 align:middle line:84%
Now, all I did is to
[multiple speaker].

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.052 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: There's no ice.

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:17.156 align:middle line:84%
There has never been
any ice cream.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.458 align:middle line:84%
But our body can not
tell the difference.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.294 align:middle line:90%
So now, click down to things

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and click the next slide 'cause
what our body does is fill

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.264 align:middle line:90%
in the information.

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:25.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:26.966 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: See it
fills in the reality.

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.736 align:middle line:84%
So all that's somebody's got
to do is hammer

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:35.441 align:middle line:84%
on message whether it
be a message about--

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ObamaCare.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: About
ObamaCare, financial,

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.446 align:middle line:90%
you know, or the bankers.

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Recession.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:41.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Or the recession

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yes.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Or the
real estate market or--

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.018 align:middle line:84%
see, I'll just put the
stimulus that's in it and all

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:46.986 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, the
audience is going

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:90%
to get this off real quick.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because
they're going to activate

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.626 align:middle line:84%
if they got impacted with
the financial down term.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:54.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Their physiology
is changing to that.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:58.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: If they lost
the house in for closure,

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.833 align:middle line:84%
immediately your audience
is going like that,

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
if they have the thought about
the financial institutions

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.205 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that
were responsible for.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: If there
is a message for that.

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.977 align:middle line:84%
If there is message you want
to put another one, no--

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:13.379 align:middle line:84%
very few people went
to jail over it.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:17.683 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden, they just
had fairness, respect, you know,

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
a consideration, protection.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.054 align:middle line:90%
You know, well if you--

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- if there's no
rule there then there's no fun,

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:27.727 align:middle line:84%
no harm, no value,
you know or a wage.

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:90%
That's called deregulation.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:31.831 align:middle line:90%
Wow, isn't that interesting?

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:32.832 align:middle line:84%
But regulation is
bad.

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:90%
No. It's for safekeeping.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: See, those
are different things.

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:39.805 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden, what I'm
doing right now is doing various

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.476 align:middle line:84%
different things of
closing the thing

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:48.047 align:middle line:84%
of in our physiology
is changing as it goes.

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:50.216 align:middle line:90%
The physiology keeps changing.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:53.019 align:middle line:90%
OK? And that's the thing to be--

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:59.091 align:middle line:84%
to remember is our body is an
alignment with the environment

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.895 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to perceive
and we're going to connect

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:07.166 align:middle line:84%
to the environment in different
ways real or imaginative .

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:10.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, this has to do with
the brain styles of thinking

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because our environment say, I'm
a creative thinker which I am.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:20.146 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to react towards
the rule maker differently.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:20.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.449 align:middle line:84%
You're going to react
to rule maker.

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:24.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And a lot of this
thing is language driven.

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:29.789 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our emotional
response is language driven.

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:32.558 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's take my son
Tristan [assumed spelling] who,

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.393 align:middle line:90%
you know, watch the TV show.

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.961 align:middle line:90%
And when he watch the TV show,

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:84%
one of the character
said this word, "idiot".

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:44.003 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it took me about
two weeks to get idiot

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.205 align:middle line:90%
out of his consciousness.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:46.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:47.573 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: What?

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.642 align:middle line:90%
"Cause he used it, he felt--

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Felt it.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- a physiological
change when he said it.

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:57.783 align:middle line:84%
There was a laughter
inside the show, therefore,

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
he thought he take that
word out for a spin.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.256 align:middle line:84%
Now, when he said,
"Dad you're an idiot."

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.258 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:09.528 align:middle line:84%
I have to listen to
that as a context.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:10.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then
I'm going to respond

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.334 align:middle line:90%
to him in subtext way.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:18.237 align:middle line:84%
So Tristan, could you be feeling
frustrated even to like me

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.239 align:middle line:84%
to have awareness
about something.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.273 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:23.776 align:middle line:90%
He goes like, "Huh?"

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:24.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Huh?

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:26.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Why?

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:29.381 align:middle line:84%
Because I want him to know that
the word idiot sets up here

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:84%
and the word awareness
sits underneath it.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:33.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, interesting

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.756 align:middle line:84%
so you're reframing the
context around idiot.

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.993 align:middle line:84%
rather than the idiot is
somebody that's stupid,

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:44.764 align:middle line:84%
which is another word that I had
to get rid of too, by the way.

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:45.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Stupid.

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because
they use these words.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see, OK.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: This labeling
context style words

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and then how do I speak to
it just like ice cream just

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
like spider, I've got
to take this words

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.079 align:middle line:84%
that are trigger words and
I've got to change them

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:05.518 align:middle line:84%
to something that's going to be
more heart center rather than--

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:06.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Intellectual.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:07.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And it's
rather than intellectual.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, so you are
entraining bad

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:14.527 align:middle line:84%
association with something by
overriding it with emotion.

00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:15.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
right I want emotion--

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:16.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%
A new--

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I want to override
with an emotion and a need

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:90%
that is underneath it.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.434 align:middle line:84%
If the need is awareness,
or the need to safe--

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Whatever
the need is.

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So lets talk about
needs based to communication.

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:27.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Sure.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you have
a strong background

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.844 align:middle line:84%
in the nonviolent
communications.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:32.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.546 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And if you can
explain that a little bit.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So for
last 13 years,

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:39.018 align:middle line:84%
I've been training nonviolent
communication developed

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:42.087 align:middle line:84%
by Marshall Rosenberg,
an international mediator

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:46.058 align:middle line:84%
who took us four-step
model of communication.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.459 align:middle line:90%
Its really the foundation

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:50.663 align:middle line:84%
of emotional intelligence
is as one practices.

00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:54.633 align:middle line:84%
This school-- tool they become
more emotionally intelligent

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.369 align:middle line:84%
about themselves as
well as about others.

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:58.904 align:middle line:90%
What is-- What a good tool.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And we know, by all
the research that's been done

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:05.311 align:middle line:84%
in emotional intelligence, how
that value set is actually one

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:09.215 align:middle line:84%
that is a better indicator
of success and the ability

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:13.385 align:middle line:84%
to work together and to be have
to contribute is the ability

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:16.488 align:middle line:84%
to deal with emotional
intelligence is actually a

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:19.792 align:middle line:84%
little bit stronger rather than
in intellectual intelligence

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:21.293 align:middle line:90%
or fact-based intelligence.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's fascinating.

00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:90%
I've read about it.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:28.867 align:middle line:84%
It's solving war conflict and
neighborhood conflict and--

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:29.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:30.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- game violence

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.771 align:middle line:84%
and its really has been an
effective tool and it's been

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:34.707 align:middle line:90%
around for a very long time.

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:36.041 align:middle line:90%
I like how you combine it

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.911 align:middle line:84%
with the Hermann
Brain Dominance Model.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, the different
quadrants of thinking along

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:45.317 align:middle line:84%
with the self awareness that the
emotional intelligence factor

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.721 align:middle line:84%
gives you is a great combination
of those two methods.

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, by having
these two different methods,

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a thinking piece to it
and allowing that to seat here,

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.596 align:middle line:84%
and then, there is the emotional
intelligence piece over here

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.798 align:middle line:84%
and they integrate so
wonderfully by the way.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:00.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Is that--
what I'm talking

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:04.536 align:middle line:84%
about is this an emotional
conflict that I need

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.772 align:middle line:84%
to really provide
some compassion to?

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:10.943 align:middle line:84%
Or, is this something that I can
really solve or engaged based

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:12.444 align:middle line:84%
on the person's brain
thinking style?

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The idea is when
we approach emotion is for us

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:84%
to change a very small limiting
belief that we have been taught.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:23.956 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: There
is no such thing

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:29.929 align:middle line:84%
as a good feeling
or a bad feeling.

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:31.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why not?

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:35.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: There is no such
thing as a negative feeling

00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:90%
or a positive feeling.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.372 align:middle line:84%
My request to the audience and
for you is to just change it

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.107 align:middle line:90%
to a new-- a new definition.

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:43.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:45.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Feelings
are only indicators.

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:49.882 align:middle line:84%
Feelings are only indicators
'cause if I take that spider

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:53.852 align:middle line:84%
at least and I move it here,
is scared a bad feeling?

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:55.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's a feeling.

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:56.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's
an indicator right?

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:57.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's an
indicator, right.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.591 align:middle line:90%
So, is it a bad feeling though?

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:00.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Not really.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely, yeah.

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Is fear
a bad feeling?

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:04.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Not really.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's not?

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:08.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: No.

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:09.802 align:middle line:90%
It's indicating something as--

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's an indicator.

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.404 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah, that's a big change.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.872 align:middle line:90%
So, fear is an indicator.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:14.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle line:90%
Is depressed a bad feeling?

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Most with
things so, yes.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:19.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Because what?

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:21.547 align:middle line:90%
It's an indicator.

00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:24.316 align:middle line:90%
It tells us that the state

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:27.019 align:middle line:84%
of our physiology is
not doing so well.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:27.753 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's a--

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:28.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- greatest
feeling that we have.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you can still feel
things like joy and exuberance

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:33.425 align:middle line:84%
and some of those are on the
other side of the scale right?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.727 align:middle line:90%
>>

00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:36.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well boy, that's
I'm glad you mention that.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.431 align:middle line:84%
If you look at our chart here,
you're going to notice that joy,

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.934 align:middle line:84%
excited, and exuberance
is on the top part

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:43.135 align:middle line:90%
of the indicator scale.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then
on the bottom part

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:46.171 align:middle line:90%
of the indicator scale

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.741 align:middle line:84%
at the very bottom is
depress setting there.

00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:49.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Depression.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Of course in
the middle guess what, calm,

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:52.544 align:middle line:90%
peaceful is sitting in there.

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:53.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How nice.

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:54.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It's in the middle.

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:57.449 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're feeling
frustrated, it just tells us

00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:00.386 align:middle line:84%
that in need of ours
is not being meet.

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:01.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:02.221 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:03.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, what
need is caused

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:08.026 align:middle line:84%
by this spider crawling
towards me if not being met?

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I need safety.

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:10.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Safety.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:17.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, fear because
safety might not be met.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.504 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So once again you
pick by this fear that's spider

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:22.941 align:middle line:84%
in mind is a gymnast and the
spider does double back gainer

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:23.542 align:middle line:90%
in to my--

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: I'm very clear

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:29.381 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
imaginary spider that I have.

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:33.452 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we change it to a
bowl of ice cream being pour,

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:36.288 align:middle line:84%
push into your direction,
you're going to feel the light

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:40.092 align:middle line:84%
and energize because the
taste of it and the comfort

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:90%
that ice cream can provide--

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:43.462 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm on the upper
end under needs.

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:43.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And you
apprehended the--

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- appearance
[phonetic] 'cause those are the

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
different needs that
are being in met.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, need based to
communication is the key

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to what you teach in terms
of effective parenting,

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.743 align:middle line:84%
effective business
relationships effective

00:22:57.743 --> 00:23:00.979 align:middle line:84%
in a personal relationships
and relationship with yourself.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.249 align:middle line:84%
As a mediator, as somebody
that teaches people

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:05.684 align:middle line:90%
to communicate better,

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:08.987 align:middle line:84%
it's trying to change some
very small limiting beliefs

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:12.024 align:middle line:84%
so that they can move
forward and exchange it

00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:15.828 align:middle line:84%
so that we start using emotions
for what they are designed for.

00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:17.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, this is key.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:19.998 align:middle line:84%
So, when we-- when we start
to understand what needs,

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:24.536 align:middle line:84%
what the needs are as indicators
as say, then it will give us

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to the red light, green light to
what the emotion is behind it.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:32.077 align:middle line:90%
So, if I feel frustrated,

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.679 align:middle line:84%
there's a need that's
not being meet.

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: If I feel thorn

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:38.116 align:middle line:84%
that tells me two needs
are not being met.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:39.751 align:middle line:84%
Right now, my need
for connection

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.653 align:middle line:90%
with is you is being meet.

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.856 align:middle line:90%
And at the same time, my need

00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:46.058 align:middle line:84%
for a connection is not
being met with my family.

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:46.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:47.926 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So I feel delighted
about my need for connection

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:52.731 align:middle line:84%
and contribution with
you at the same time,

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.901 align:middle line:84%
if I think about playing
with my seven-year-old,

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:58.437 align:middle line:84%
you know swimming
in the hot tub.

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:00.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: See.

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:03.208 align:middle line:90%
Look at all this stuff.

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.409 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:05.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then, by
calling out those two needs,

00:24:05.978 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
do you feel more complete in
recognizing those feeling?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:11.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:13.018 align:middle line:90%
Then I can choose.

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:14.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Then you can choose.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That I could
choose 'cause I know

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.054 align:middle line:90%
which one I'm picking.

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you are choosing
to be here right now.

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:18.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know what
I'm going to choose be full

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.758 align:middle line:90%
in present with you Lisa and--

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:20.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's very nice.

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and meet
the need for friendship.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:22.294 align:middle line:90%
But look at how--

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That is so great.

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- all of a sudden,

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
we're getting reenergize
even thought about.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:27.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, the
ability to exchange information,

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.301 align:middle line:84%
to talked about something
that is valuable--

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Or excited about--

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:31.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- to
contribute to the audience,

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.171 align:middle line:90%
to talk about how energize this.

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:35.407 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, if there
was something that showed

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:37.743 align:middle line:84%
up that would, that you know,
something that would come

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:40.579 align:middle line:84%
in from other, you know,
from another place.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:43.282 align:middle line:84%
We could feel confused
which tells us--

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:44.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle:-- that there
is several different needs

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:84%
that aren't being met if we
get into accomplish issue.

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Indicator.

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.421 align:middle line:90%
Uh-hmm, right.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: If we are-- If we're
feeling panic that tells us

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.991 align:middle line:84%
that thing-- the engine-- the
engine is not working right.

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:57.229 align:middle line:84%
Furious tells us that seven
needs are not being met.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Seven.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.131 align:middle line:90%
Wow, there's a slide.

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:00.332 align:middle line:84%
There's a great scale
that you have here on one

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.334 align:middle line:84%
of these slides but, let's
take a look at this idea

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.536 align:middle line:90%
of taking these unmet needs.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:05.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:25:05.537 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And what
pushes my buttons.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:07.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.141 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.642 align:middle line:84%
And that's the idea is like
lets say-- lets say our--

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:14.046 align:middle line:84%
se our eyes and our ears
are meant really basically

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:18.417 align:middle line:84%
for really one thing,
the power of observation.

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.352 align:middle line:90%
Not to judge, just to observe.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I want
to see things.

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:23.989 align:middle line:90%
What am I seeing?

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:24.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:25.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: What am I hearing?

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:27.292 align:middle line:90%
What did the person say?

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:30.095 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:32.965 align:middle line:84%
If I can hold it here, and
not let it hit the button--

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Right, 'cause sometimes
it's not very vice nice

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.635 align:middle line:90%
like you're mean like--

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:37.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Oh, I
like that sentence.

00:25:37.603 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:90%
Say that back-- now watch.

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:39.271 align:middle line:90%
Say you're mean.

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:39.771 align:middle line:90%
Bill you're mean.

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.572 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Bill, you're mean.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, so
the words are coming.

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:50.782 align:middle line:84%
If it hits this button towards
kindness, I will feel sad.

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:56.455 align:middle line:84%
If it hits this button called
respect, I might get angry.

00:25:56.455 --> 00:26:04.696 align:middle line:84%
Just so, you can't make me
feel, it's how I take it.

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.568 align:middle line:84%
So if a child says,
"Mommy I hate you."

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:10.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I love
that sentence.

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:11.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, I
hate that sentence.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:12.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Here it comes.

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.039 align:middle line:90%
"Mommy I hate you."

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.642 align:middle line:84%
So immediately its--
if it hits the need

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
for connection then the
person would feel sad.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.051 align:middle line:84%
If it hits the need for love,
then you'll feel disheartened--

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Hurt.

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.219 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Or hurt.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.154 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:29.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, what
do you do with that?

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:30.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:33.425 align:middle line:84%
Well, first thing
is connect to self.

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I feel hurt
and I really have a need

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:40.198 align:middle line:84%
for kindness and
love between us.

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:41.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: But I
hear that you feel mad

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:46.571 align:middle line:84%
and you really want
me to hear something.

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%
See, behind the word hate is,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.679 align:middle line:84%
could you be feeling some
hate right now and you want

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.747 align:middle line:84%
to hear something
I'm not hearing.

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.182 align:middle line:90%
"I want ice cream right now."

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So you would really
like some choice right not.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.587 align:middle line:90%
See, it's not about hating mom.

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:03.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No.

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:04.489 align:middle line:84%
This is a great, great
way to start so--

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:05.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It's about choice.

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Let's take it
to business relationship

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:09.995 align:middle line:84%
for someone who is talking
about you behind your back.

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Oh, good sentence.

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:13.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So lets
suppose they say something

00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and you find out about it.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.135 align:middle line:90%
OK. So now I'll--

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, so the
sentence would be,

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:19.838 align:middle line:84%
"She's not very good
at her job."

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Excellent sentence.

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:24.209 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to use my ears
as observation, no judgment.

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Lisa: OK.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Not very good
at a job and I want to find

00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:27.045 align:middle line:90%
out about that in a sense.

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's say, "Hey listen.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.981 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get some
understanding

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.017 align:middle line:90%
about why you said that."

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:34.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Understanding
is the need.

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:37.489 align:middle line:84%
If it hits the need
for the respect,

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
anger is going to show up.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, could you
say to that person,

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:90%
"I'm feeling a lack of respect."

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I'm feeling
uncomfortable right now

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:45.797 align:middle line:90%
and I need some, I need some--

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Understanding.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- understanding
or, and I'm really feeling mad

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.037 align:middle line:84%
and I really some be respect
between the two of us.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:53.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:53.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And when
I hear that I'm good

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:56.108 align:middle line:90%
at the job with that say that.

00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:59.211 align:middle line:84%
I want to get some understanding
about what the motive was.

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:02.714 align:middle line:84%
And I want really make sure
that there's mutual respect

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.583 align:middle line:84%
between you and I
in the workplace.

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.151 align:middle line:90%
So connect to need.

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.754 align:middle line:90%
So, say if I have a complaint

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that my coworker isn't
pulling their weight.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.625 align:middle line:84%
Or they're not doing
as much I'm doing.

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:14.459 align:middle line:90%
Say, for example.

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Great.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Sure.

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:17.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, my need of--

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:20.198 align:middle line:84%
'cause this is a common
complaint in the workplace.

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.433 align:middle line:90%
My need-- what would that--

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Fairness.

00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:22.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Fairness.

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:23.869 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:25.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Pulling their
weight is fairness.

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:27.005 align:middle line:84%
So the audience to
get the...

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:29.641 align:middle line:84%
that the sentences
pulling you weight,

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.143 align:middle line:90%
that's a context sentence.

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: The subtext
is fairness

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.781 align:middle line:90%
and maybe consideration.

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, the audiences
might be watching me.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.318 align:middle line:84%
I'm pointing to-- this
is my heart space.

00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:42.287 align:middle line:90%
This is where my needs are.

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:84%
My gut, my gut feeling is what
I'm pointing to down here.

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.761 align:middle line:84%
So my little slide
is going like, OK,

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
if somebody cuts me off in
a car and I'm seeing that,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.569 align:middle line:90%
then my need for consideration--

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:58.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Is not met.

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- is not met.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.006 align:middle line:84%
And irritated, that's
how I'm going to feel.

00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:02.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:03.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now if
I want to dump

00:29:03.308 --> 00:29:05.477 align:middle line:84%
that emotion very quickly
I would say this to my self

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:07.746 align:middle line:90%
in the car while I'm driving.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: "Man, I feel
irritated 'cause my need

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:14.486 align:middle line:84%
for consideration
is met that driver.

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:20.292 align:middle line:84%
I'm localizing and I'm saying
this happened in this moment."

00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:21.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And then what happens?

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:22.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Then happens is

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:25.931 align:middle line:84%
because I'm using an emotional
intelligence, I'm saying,

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:28.066 align:middle line:90%
"I feel because I need."

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.701 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anymore
power me.

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Over you.

00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:32.671 align:middle line:84%
So it dissipates
the frustration.

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:33.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.206 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change--

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Very good.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- my physiology.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This could have to
do with, I mean this is key

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.278 align:middle line:90%
in terms of relationships.

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.314 align:middle line:84%
That one thing that
your spouse does

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:44.683 align:middle line:90%
that pushes your buttons or--

00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:47.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, you can have
that thought and tell that story

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.989 align:middle line:84%
over and over again for
15 or 20 or 30 years.

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:54.192 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, it
just happened once

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:55.894 align:middle line:90%
and the person needed feedback.

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.229 align:middle line:90%
Now, in the next--

00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:58.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Leaving your socks
in the floor, whatever yeah.

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:01.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: But when we're
doing this and the next slide

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:84%
that you have up here is that
I'm telling myself stories.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.608 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that's
actually causing my physiology

00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:10.809 align:middle line:90%
to escalate.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.277 align:middle line:90%
It'll sound like this.

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.812 align:middle line:90%
"That person kept me off.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.014 align:middle line:84%
It didn't meet my need
for considerations."

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:20.051 align:middle line:84%
You know what, you know,
they could've hit me.

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:23.855 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just push my
own button for safety.

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:27.425 align:middle line:90%
Now I feel scared and irritated.

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:30:28.627 --> 00:30:31.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Then I go back
up to my head for help.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.631 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't and so help here.

00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Watch. LA drivers are
the worst of the world.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.068 align:middle line:84%
Now I just pushed my
button for fairness.

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:40.772 align:middle line:84%
Now I got consideration
and safety and fairness.

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:41.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All lead up.

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: All lead up.

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.541 align:middle line:90%
You know, it does take--

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:45.543 align:middle line:84%
just takes a microsecond 'cause
this next slide I'll show,

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:46.111 align:middle line:90%
ready?

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:47.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: They
meant to do that.

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:49.547 align:middle line:90%
They saw me here.

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:50.749 align:middle line:90%
Who do they think they are?

00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:53.118 align:middle line:84%
Now I just put my respect
button.

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:54.085 align:middle line:90%
Now, I got respect.

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They're
trying to hurt me.

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:55.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And
they're trying to, so.

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:56.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, yes.

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Meanwhile,
I'm escalating

00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
building an emotional load.

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Just like the emotional load
builds, it could be reduced

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.432 align:middle line:90%
by thought in language choice.

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:08.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, lets take
an example of something

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:12.337 align:middle line:84%
that your spouse does like
leaving the socks on the floor,

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:14.239 align:middle line:90%
or the shoes on the floor.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.474 align:middle line:84%
So, my need for cleanliness
is not met.

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:17.809 align:middle line:90%
Is that that thing--

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's right, I
really need some cleanliness

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:21.947 align:middle line:84%
and I need some order and
I need some consideration.

00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:23.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:24.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And support.

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.216 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm up to four needs.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.484 align:middle line:90%
You see all that is.

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.954 align:middle line:84%
Listen, support would look
like you putting the stuff

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:30.555 align:middle line:90%
in the hamper-- a hamper.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh OK.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:31.923 align:middle line:90%
So this is what you say.

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:32.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:33.725 align:middle line:90%
So, I feel frustrated.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:34.859 align:middle line:90%
I need some support.

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:36.528 align:middle line:84%
Support would like
putting it in the hamper.

00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.731 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I really feel that
you're irritated

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:40.966 align:middle line:84%
and I really have
a need for order.

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:44.336 align:middle line:84%
Order would look like
putting the socks this way.

00:31:44.336 --> 00:31:46.338 align:middle line:84%
When you take them off,
please pull them out,

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
so when I wash them, I don't
have to pull them out for you.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:51.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: 'Cause
they kind of smell.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.044 align:middle line:84%
I have a need for order
and consideration.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.914 align:middle line:84%
And consideration would like
pulling you're socks out.

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:59.084 align:middle line:84%
So the dirt is not in there
and I don't have to do it.

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:03.388 align:middle line:84%
Would you be willing to meet
my need for consideration?

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:04.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: This kind

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of communication really
happens in a household?

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yes.

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:84%
If you pick it, if
you pick the word--

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Constantly--

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- the
other person will--

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:16.768 align:middle line:84%
the compliance rate
is so much higher.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.837 align:middle line:84%
If I go into my son,
Aden [assumed spelling],

00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:23.308 align:middle line:84%
and I say to him, "Aden, I
really have a need for care.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.544 align:middle line:84%
And care would like the
clothes that are on the floor

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:29.214 align:middle line:90%
to be put in this basket.

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:33.118 align:middle line:84%
That the wrappers that are
on your computer desk for it

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:36.588 align:middle line:84%
to be put in the garbage
can right below the desk.

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Would be willing to tell what
you've heard me said 'cause I

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.593 align:middle line:84%
want him to get connected
to what I just said.

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:43.628 align:middle line:90%
Not say the sentence, yes dad,

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:46.164 align:middle line:84%
'cause the compliance rate
is only like 10 percent--

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:46.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's over.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:47.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: If they say yes.

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:48.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:49.567 align:middle line:90%
And it's probably less.

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:51.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, anyhow,
but a lot of times you'd find

00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:53.405 align:middle line:84%
out the message sent is
not some message receive.

00:32:53.405 --> 00:32:54.406 align:middle line:90%
So, I always check it.

00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.807 align:middle line:84%
I say, could you
tell me a little

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.576 align:middle line:84%
about what you think you say is
like, "Huh, what did you say?"

00:32:58.576 --> 00:33:01.312 align:middle line:84%
And he said yes to
something a second ago.

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:04.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's good for
a child but for a spouse,

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:05.984 align:middle line:90%
you can't really-- yeah.

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well for spouse, you
just rephrase it a little bit.

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, listen I just
want to make sure that I'm able

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.858 align:middle line:84%
to get what you're
saying accurately.

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:15.126 align:middle line:90%
So what you see will--

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:16.628 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or, did you
hear what I said.

00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:17.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Did you
hear what I say?

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I couldn't
just-- let me see if I--

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.634 align:middle line:84%
see if I've gotten, if your
message sent, message received.

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:25.603 align:middle line:84%
So that it doesn't hear
like what the spouse.

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.605 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure it
doesn't hear like a demand

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:90%
or it's just a request.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But you can even--

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:31.109 align:middle line:84%
so how would you say
that to your boss?

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:32.444 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear what I said?

00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:34.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: For the boss, I
would say its like, "Listen,

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:37.248 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't makes sure that I've
heard what you've said clearly."

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:38.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.051 align:middle line:84%
But what about what you
said so you feel hurt.

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:41.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Listen,
I want to make sure

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that the message I
just said is something

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.926 align:middle line:84%
that matches what's
going on in your head.

00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:49.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow, that's empowering.

00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:51.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Oh, it's huge
because the boss would go,

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.163 align:middle line:90%
"Oh yeah, let me hear it again."

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Again, what
do you just said?

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Wait oh, and
the boss is going like,

00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:56.868 align:middle line:90%
I never really listen to him so,

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:59.037 align:middle line:84%
and then they repeat something
back 'cause they give us some

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
things possible but I kind of
was thinking at about this way,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.341 align:middle line:90%
is that what you had in mind?

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:06.077 align:middle line:84%
Oh yes, that's exact-- oh no, I
think I would like it this way.

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.078 align:middle line:90%
Great, thank you very much.

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:08.313 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I really want
to make sure

00:34:08.313 --> 00:34:10.048 align:middle line:84%
that it's the way
you would like it.

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:14.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So it turns into
a service piece rather than,

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:17.856 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's a hundred
things going on in your head

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:19.257 align:middle line:90%
and you're not listening to me.

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:23.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And also so then if you
don't do that, your brain starts

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
to fill up with all
this stories.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:25.730 align:middle line:90%
My boss hates me.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.664 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't listen to me.

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:27.499 align:middle line:84%
He's going to hire
somebody else.

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:28.433 align:middle line:90%
Dari dah dah [phonetic].

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:29.701 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go
on with this--

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And you're
pressing the safekeeping part

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:33.905 align:middle line:84%
of your brain and it's
causing your performance drop

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.308 align:middle line:84%
because your brain goes into
fight, flight and freeze.

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:40.345 align:middle line:84%
The story feeds on the
emotion part of the brain

00:34:40.345 --> 00:34:42.713 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is trying
to go after protection

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:44.516 align:middle line:84%
where protection
wasn't necessary.

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So that
explains this next slide

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.355 align:middle line:84%
which is an overflowing amount
of fight, flight or freeze

00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:52.490 align:middle line:84%
where you create your
story around something

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.325 align:middle line:90%
that it just explodes.

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:58.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: There's huge job
turnover that takes place here.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.166 align:middle line:90%
So many good employees leave

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.068 align:middle line:84%
because they have
accumulated safety message--

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:05.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Stories--

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and stories
that are not in alignment

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.407 align:middle line:90%
within the brain starts

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:13.077 align:middle line:84%
to actually tilt
towards those things.

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:14.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So that this is,

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:19.617 align:middle line:84%
does the brain functionality
actually decrease as the fight,

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.252 align:middle line:90%
flight or freeze increases?

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:22.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, if
you keep pushing the--

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:27.158 align:middle line:84%
if you keep pushing the button
based on a mental thought

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:30.028 align:middle line:84%
and a belief and a meaning
making that you're doing

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:34.332 align:middle line:84%
up here, the brain goes
into a protective mode.

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.768 align:middle line:84%
It's got to go into
protective mode.

00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:39.737 align:middle line:84%
So, all the imprints
from childhood,

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:41.339 align:middle line:84%
even generationally
the things that thing

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:44.209 align:middle line:84%
that we've discovered
too is is that a spider,

00:35:44.209 --> 00:35:47.445 align:middle line:84%
the image of a spider, I
bring that or snake or an owl

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:51.549 align:middle line:84%
or some of-- or the bird
or prey that'll show

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:56.788 align:middle line:84%
up is a mental imprint
from our ancestors.

00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:57.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You can show
you it too a little kid

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:01.826 align:middle line:84%
and they've never
seen a spider before

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:04.762 align:middle line:90%
but their genes remember it.

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:07.599 align:middle line:84%
Their genes will
remember the spider.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Why? 'Cause that was a fear that
this ancestor had that said,

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.139 align:middle line:90%
"Hey, the snake was dangerous."

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know a
very, very interesting.

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:90%
So, there's a tracking of that.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:20.378 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:21.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All right.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:90%
So, there's-- We're talking

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.482 align:middle line:84%
about communication
styles here and--

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:25.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah, that's right.

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:26.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- how the
phases of communication

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:84%
as you become more aware of
this communication styles,

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.389 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness
increases, yes.

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:34.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Boy, you know the
biggest thing and the thing I

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:37.228 align:middle line:84%
like to really do when I talk
about this particular slide is

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:90%
to get people off the hook.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.432 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I like to
get people off the hook is

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:44.636 align:middle line:84%
that there so many
triggers that causes

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:47.305 align:middle line:84%
to either become a
nice dead person--

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:48.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: A nice dead person.

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- is somebody
that submits our needs

00:36:50.642 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:90%
to the needs of others.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:57.148 align:middle line:84%
Or a monster person that gets
our needs met our lashes out,

00:36:57.148 --> 00:37:00.018 align:middle line:84%
finally we've had it in
this volcano shows up.

00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:01.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:02.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then
this volcano shows up,

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:05.456 align:middle line:84%
and then the submission
shows up,

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.692 align:middle line:84%
and then this rebellion
shows up,

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:10.194 align:middle line:84%
and this control
shows up and this--

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This defines
most relationships.

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: And this...

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:15.366 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a cycle of nice
dead person, monster person,

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.702 align:middle line:84%
nice dead person, monster
person, nice dead person.

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:18.836 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you don't
execute how you feel.

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.006 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And in
relationship too,

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.509 align:middle line:84%
what the need it
that's causing it.

00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:28.212 align:middle line:84%
It tends to work better to
not focus on feeling as much.

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is this
why people blow up?

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hold it in, hold it
in, hold it in and you just blow

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:90%
up at the tiniest little thing?

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.655 align:middle line:84%
You're going to-- it's because
it's like an accumulation

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
of things that are built up.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.393 align:middle line:84%
A series of needs that
haven't been fully expressed

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.661 align:middle line:90%
or engage upon.

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, on
the other side

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.766 align:middle line:90%
of the explosion is depression.

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:52.236 align:middle line:84%
Depression is only an
internal part of an--

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Series.

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- explosion
of, you know, I can't,

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:58.976 align:middle line:84%
it's not safe enough for
me to explode outside

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.745 align:middle line:90%
because that's a jeopardy

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:03.748 align:middle line:84%
that it'll provide
jeopardy to my life.

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.616 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going
to explode outside.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:06.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:08.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: 'Cause if I did
that once when I was a kid

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:11.522 align:middle line:84%
and when I was three years
old and I exploded and I--

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:14.158 align:middle line:84%
and there was something and
my parent shut that down.

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And it wasn't safe.

00:38:15.193 --> 00:38:17.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And I
realized that, "Hey.

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:19.464 align:middle line:84%
I better not bring
this anger thing

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:22.166 align:middle line:84%
or I'd better not bring
this full expression.

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.869 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to play small and
I'm going to keep my voice

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:90%
small. I'll play the martyr.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to eat out,
trying to get my needs met."

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.776 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we have a full
expression of our emotion.

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.479 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like a full
range of emotions to go like,

00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:37.181 align:middle line:84%
hey listen when you come
feeling angry and I know

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:40.585 align:middle line:84%
that anger is causes by some
judgments I have and my need

00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:43.855 align:middle line:84%
for consideration and
fairness wasn't really met.

00:38:43.855 --> 00:38:46.157 align:middle line:84%
And this is what consideration
and fairness would look like.

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:49.727 align:middle line:84%
And immediately the anger
has just left my body

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:51.162 align:middle line:90%
that I'm haven't let go of--

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's amazing
how that works.

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:53.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Having
let go of that..

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It is amazing
how that works.

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:58.069 align:middle line:84%
So, this next slide talks
about the, how amygdala has

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.472 align:middle line:84%
that fight, flight or
freeze functionality to it.

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:04.409 align:middle line:84%
If you don't express that then
it-- does it start to shut down?

00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:05.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's correct.

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.978 align:middle line:84%
It'll start-- It'll
start to shut down.

00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:13.017 align:middle line:84%
It starts to move into a place
of protection in reference to,

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.686 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to bring
that creative idea

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.156 align:middle line:84%
out because I once
had that ability.

00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:21.192 align:middle line:84%
I brought that creative idea
and it was a great idea and boy,

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:24.162 align:middle line:84%
that teacher shut me down
and so ideas are dangerous.

00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Boy, you know what?

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:29.367 align:middle line:84%
I had that right answer in
math but my creative way

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.403 align:middle line:84%
and my Einstein part of my
brain was going like, "Hey,

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:34.372 align:middle line:84%
I'm manipulating math
in a different way

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:37.341 align:middle line:90%
but the teacher called it wrong

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
following the steps.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And I miss the
step but you know what?

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.916 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was actually closer
to it than the teacher was.

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:47.051 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really fully
supported and the rest

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:51.856 align:middle line:84%
of the class laughed when
I came up with that answer.

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:55.193 align:middle line:84%
So I better not express myself
fully and I better back off

00:39:55.193 --> 00:39:59.397 align:middle line:84%
on that and make sure I figure
it out before I speak up.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:02.066 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got a hesitant
risk taker.

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:03.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:04.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: You know, I mean--

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, we
can all identify.

00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:05.903 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: If you think

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:08.673 align:middle line:84%
about the financial
downturn even that part.

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:10.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The recession.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: The fight,

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:15.413 align:middle line:84%
flight and freeze response
were just the problems

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:19.750 align:middle line:84%
at the economy, the problem is
the ability to take risk again.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.786 align:middle line:90%
That's actually the problem.

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's true.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It goes,
who are the risk takers?

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:25.356 align:middle line:90%
The entrepreneurs.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Nobody will take risks
again, yeah.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.724 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:27.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: The entrepreneurs.

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:28.259 align:middle line:90%
What is an entrepreneur do?

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.193 align:middle line:90%
Come up with an idea.

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.461 align:middle line:84%
What do they do
with that idea?

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Take a risk.

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:32.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Build
and take the risk.

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:33.764 align:middle line:84%
And when they take the
risk what they have to do?

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.467 align:middle line:90%
Hire people to support them.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Interesting.

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:39.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Get other people
aligned with their vision.

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:40.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Get other people
aligned with that vision.

00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:41.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:42.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Now I
got people aligned.

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.174 align:middle line:90%
Now I've hired people.

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:43.975 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:45.443 align:middle line:90%
Creative task base.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.644 align:middle line:90%
What is that do?

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:51.516 align:middle line:84%
Get us a-- the idea is not
shutting down government

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to make things work; the way we
got out of the last recession

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.456 align:middle line:84%
by the way is to grow
our self out of it.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, we did.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: To grow,
well what do you need to do?

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Feed entrepreneurs.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.096 align:middle line:84%
Now let's say that every
entrepreneur has the best idea

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.999 align:middle line:84%
on the planet but are very
clear about this detail.

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:13.304 align:middle line:84%
You start funding them and
build that incubation on risk

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and get them to higher
marketing people

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and costumer service
people and inter, you know,

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.779 align:middle line:84%
implementing people like
feeling pretty good idea.

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You know the
pack was born

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.849 align:middle line:90%
out of the last recession?

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:25.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's a good example.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's called
growing-- grow out of the issue.

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.623 align:middle line:90%
Don't think that you can reduce

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:35.526 align:middle line:84%
out of the issue 'cause you
can't reduce out of the issue.

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:38.930 align:middle line:84%
You cant like put a big,
you know, control over stuff

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.134 align:middle line:84%
because the population
has grown past that now,

00:41:43.134 --> 00:41:44.535 align:middle line:84%
when you already
past that point.

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah and that's--

00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:47.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You can't
shut growth down.

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.706 align:middle line:90%
Its likes trying to--

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Not in this
day and age.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: No.

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.677 align:middle line:84%
No. Human beings are
going to still put--

00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
be putting human
beings on the planet.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.982 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to figure
how to grow.

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:58.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: We always have.

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.084 align:middle line:90%
That's what progress is.

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:00.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Or why not.

00:42:00.785 --> 00:42:01.752 align:middle line:90%
That's what progress is.

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:04.155 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it works much
better that way.

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:04.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:05.856 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.758 align:middle line:84%
So, going back to Marshall
Rosenberg's definition

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:10.161 align:middle line:84%
of nonviolent communication,
there is a side here to kind

00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:10.861 align:middle line:84%
of redefined the
[multiple speaker]--

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: There is.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.864 align:middle line:84%
Here is the slide and really
basically this slide is talking

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.232 align:middle line:90%
about four steps.

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:18.502 align:middle line:84%
And you also notice that these
four steps are color coded.

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:21.138 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they're color
coded is because they're talking

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:22.607 align:middle line:84%
about different parts
of the brain

00:42:22.607 --> 00:42:24.141 align:middle line:90%
or different styles of thinking.

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:25.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
a different piece

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:29.714 align:middle line:84%
of the equation you haven't
seen before but watch this.

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:34.485 align:middle line:84%
It's that observation is
more powerful than judgment.

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:35.853 align:middle line:90%
Observation.

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.254 align:middle line:90%
How do we observe something?

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's a
very important quote.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.859 align:middle line:84%
The highest form of
intelligence is the ability

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.661 align:middle line:90%
to observe without judgment.

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That is incredible.

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:45.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: OK.

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:46.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Neutrality.

00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:48.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Very,
very, very I want to--

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to observe that
judgment so all the people

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.601 align:middle line:90%
that you're listening to on news

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That could solve
whole much conflict.

00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:53.404 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: All the people were
listening to our news are not

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.374 align:middle line:90%
in the place of observation.

00:42:56.374 --> 00:42:57.708 align:middle line:84%
They're in the place
of judgment.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:01.679 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because a judgment
stimulates the limbic part

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.281 align:middle line:90%
of the brain because guess what?

00:43:03.281 --> 00:43:04.915 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden, I'm
going to be getting engaged.

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.817 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because you've
engaged my fight,

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:07.885 align:middle line:90%
flight and freeze response.

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:08.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You're not
observing the whole thing.

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:14.592 align:middle line:84%
You're nor saying, "Hey, what
is the healthcare thing going

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.261 align:middle line:84%
to really do and what
is the financial impact

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:20.464 align:middle line:84%
and really looking that is
from an observation place is

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:23.267 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to save more
money by doing it this way

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:25.836 align:middle line:84%
than doing it the way
what we've been doing it.

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.738 align:middle line:84%
Will some people be
affected by that?

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.774 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because
guess what, you're trying

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:35.846 align:middle line:84%
to institute change that is over
the long more cost effective.

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:36.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And that's
the thing.

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:40.051 align:middle line:84%
We're playing the long game
instead of the short game.

00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:42.186 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're playing.

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's not working.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.854 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:44.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well.

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, that
was my judgment.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.559 align:middle line:84%
OK, the observation
is that's what is.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.794 align:middle line:90%
That is what is happening.

00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:51.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's
what is happening.

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:51.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:53.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well done.

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:54.765 align:middle line:84%
So look at how you moved your
place into an observation place.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:55.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, yes.

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:56.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well done.

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:59.737 align:middle line:84%
So, we can move into a place of
judgment and see is this true?

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And then say, "Oh, I guess it
is from the bigger perspective."

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:84%
That's called the difference
between a child's response

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.278 align:middle line:90%
and an adult's response.

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:10.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, look at the
nation's response to ObamaCare.

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:11.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Because of--

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh well,
tehre's a lot--

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: -- messaging.

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:14.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, a lot of--

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:17.054 align:middle line:84%
lack of communication
or misunderstanding

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:90%
or not clarity around it, yeah.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Well, yeah.

00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:23.094 align:middle line:84%
If I want to pound
a belief structure

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:26.931 align:middle line:84%
and I create a limbic response
to call people to get scared

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:29.100 align:middle line:84%
about it, all I got to
do is just scare people

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.668 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy to scare people.

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:33.804 align:middle line:84%
And it because that its easy to
where you can imagine, you know,

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:38.609 align:middle line:84%
a snake or, you know, a
lion or something like that

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:39.977 align:middle line:84%
and if I keep saying
there's a lion there,

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.278 align:middle line:84%
there's a lion there,
there's a lion there.

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.214 align:middle line:84%
You know there's a lion on
the other side of that door.

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:45.816 align:middle line:84%
There's a lion on the
other side of that door.

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.952 align:middle line:84%
The brain cannot
tell the difference.

00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:49.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So it's a
scare tactic and--

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:52.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I am going to
scare to not meet the need

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:54.992 align:middle line:90%
for safety because it's unknown.

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:58.529 align:middle line:84%
It's behind the door,
Lisa there's a lion.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.231 align:middle line:84%
Is there generally
a lion behind?

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:01.499 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's very interesting
what you've just said,

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.801 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:05.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
needs not being met.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Excellent--
Excellent things.

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:11.342 align:middle line:84%
The idea then is to,
emotions are always going

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:12.977 align:middle line:90%
to follow a need.

00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:16.447 align:middle line:84%
So, when there's a
stimulus that's coming in

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:21.552 align:middle line:84%
and my eyeball is seeing it
or my ears are hearing it,

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.487 align:middle line:90%
it's going to push a button.

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:28.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And that's going
to cause an emotion to show up.

00:45:28.526 --> 00:45:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Nobody can
make us feel anything.

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:31.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: It's how we take it.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.634 align:middle line:84%
So, is it the need for
respect that's getting pushed?

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Is it the need for fairness
that's getting pushed?

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.307 align:middle line:84%
Is it the need for connection
that's getting pushed?

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Then that's what all
of these different needs are

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:47.912 align:middle line:90%
and so you can take this slide

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:50.014 align:middle line:84%
and you could always
measure this

00:45:50.014 --> 00:45:51.215 align:middle line:90%
against the need its not being.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:53.384 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're feeling
upset about something,

00:45:53.384 --> 00:45:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you can just look in and
say, OK maybe I'm feeling

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.322 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not having
trust and then so,

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.957 align:middle line:84%
this could be a good
way to start,

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.425 align:middle line:84%
getting in touch
with your needs.

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's exactly right
and we have not been taught.

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:05.095 align:middle line:90%
In needs base narrative.

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:08.265 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught a
problem solving narrative.

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:11.001 align:middle line:84%
And this is why everybody
gets off the hook is

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:14.271 align:middle line:84%
that if we're taught a
problem solving narrative,

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:17.808 align:middle line:84%
that feelings are supposed to
be fixed that there's supposed

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:20.311 align:middle line:84%
to be a good feeling
and a bad feeling.

00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.414 align:middle line:84%
That means that that's not
the way the body's work.

00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- That's not our
natural design because can't--

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.321 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, if you and I do not
have access to scared,

00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:90%
nervous, anxious and fear.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.960 align:middle line:84%
If we don't know those
things, we cannot drive a car.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.696 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
driving and we're happy--

00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, yes.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- that's
when we're in trouble.

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.366 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:45.169 align:middle line:84%
'Cause we're actually the--
most of our needs are being met

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.605 align:middle line:84%
and we're not paying attention
to and when we're not in touch

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:48.806 align:middle line:90%
to the need for safety.

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:51.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So there are
required needs to keep us

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.176 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:57.915 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- our physiology is
designed for that response.

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Responsiveness, yes
I was just going to say that.

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.751 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:03.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So the-- When we
first look at neuropeptides

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:05.623 align:middle line:84%
and this molecules of
emotion that show up,

00:47:05.623 --> 00:47:09.793 align:middle line:84%
the first things is they
start showing in bony fish.

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:12.663 align:middle line:84%
So, if look at bony
fish and we say, OK.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.398 align:middle line:90%
Imagine a school of fish.

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:16.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: OK, here
is a school of fish

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:17.635 align:middle line:84%
and all these fish
forming together.

00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:22.072 align:middle line:84%
This one fish has a
feeling and makes a turn.

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.474 align:middle line:90%
Why does it have a feeling?

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:26.877 align:middle line:84%
'Cause it has the access to
nervous, anxious, worried,

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:30.514 align:middle line:84%
scared that has-- it
has that range, OK?

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.284 align:middle line:84%
And what? 'Cause there's
a predator coming here.

00:47:33.284 --> 00:47:34.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Feeling
anxious, nervous,

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:38.022 align:middle line:90%
worried is good for that fish.

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:39.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:40.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It's good for that--
'cause it's going to get eaten.

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.626 align:middle line:84%
It turns and the rest
of the school turns.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:43.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:45.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Do they
all talk to each other?

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:45.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No.

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:46.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: No.

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:49.633 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say, "Hey,
barracuda over on this side."

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.068 align:middle line:90%
They ain't doing that right?

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:53.804 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, they're
seeing the turn.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.807 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're energetically
experiencing the turn.

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:58.576 align:middle line:84%
And the whole the
school is moving.

00:47:58.576 --> 00:47:59.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Almost unconscious.

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:00.878 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:03.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's right, it is
a whole field that is moving.

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:04.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You can--
They're moving the field.

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.252 align:middle line:84%
'Cause you and I and as well
as the audience, if all of us--

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:11.622 align:middle line:84%
if all of us have had
those intuitive moments--

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- where we know
something is up and we respond

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.929 align:middle line:84%
without thinking about
it and say, "Hey,

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.098 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was
but I just moved my car--

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- I missed
that whole accident.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:26.503 align:middle line:84%
Or its possibly thinking, oh I
know that this person's going

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.572 align:middle line:84%
to hurt me and I respond
this way whereas maybe

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.974 align:middle line:84%
that person didn't have
an intention, yeah.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:31.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Well, they
didn't have that intention.

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.343 align:middle line:90%
We're creating the opposite

00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:33.811 align:middle line:84%
if it were there's
something inside--

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:34.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Creating the opposite.

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- and
we're creating

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:37.047 align:middle line:84%
that opposite thing
inside ourselves.

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:39.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: As what this slide
tells is the opposite.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.518 align:middle line:84%
It's still-- when
the need is not met

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and when the need is met.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.522 align:middle line:84%
So, on the left side, you'll
see the needs that are met

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:46.757 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings
that you'll have.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.025 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah, on the
left side you're going to see

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.396 align:middle line:84%
when how do I feel
when my need is met?

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.531 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to feel glad, happy.

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:55.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh I see, OK.

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:57.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And on the left
side is jus, this side I'm going

00:48:57.901 --> 00:48:59.136 align:middle line:90%
to feel when my need is not met.

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.504 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.172 align:middle line:84%
That there's going to
be a sense of anxious,

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.273 align:middle line:90%
nervous, worried and scared.

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.975 align:middle line:90%
So, at least I've just--

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:08.145 align:middle line:84%
I request the people that
are listening is to get used

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:11.415 align:middle line:84%
to making all feeling, you
know, just welcome them all

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.317 align:middle line:84%
in with the sense
of curiousness.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to then say, wow you
feel frustrated, how wonderful.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.257 align:middle line:90%
Wow, you feel delighted, great.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:21.425 align:middle line:90%
Well, you feel angry.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What need
is not being met?

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:25.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So, when my
seven-year old was like to two

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:28.632 align:middle line:84%
and three and they would go
into a thing called tantrum

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.869 align:middle line:84%
like that's a bad thing, there's
nothing bad to the tantrum.

00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: 'it's just a
need that's not being met.

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:36.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That kid is
practicing his emotions.

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:40.177 align:middle line:84%
That animal, that
little wonderful ball of,

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:41.011 align:middle line:90%
you know, animal in this--

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Energy.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- of
energy that's coming in.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.649 align:middle line:84%
They're going furious
and I'm enjoying

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.786 align:middle line:84%
that furiousness 'cause
there's a series of needs

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:52.523 align:middle line:84%
that that kid is looking
to connect to language wise

00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:55.793 align:middle line:84%
that they're depending
on me as a parent

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:57.428 align:middle line:90%
to get connected to that stuff.

00:49:57.428 --> 00:49:58.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To understand it.

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:00.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: My first
sentence is, I'm guessing

00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're feeling furious
and you've really likes

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.968 align:middle line:84%
to hear what's, you
like me to hear

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.236 align:middle line:84%
and understand what's
going on inside you?

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:07.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's an--

00:50:07.538 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: That's a
compassionate response to that.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:10.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To a tantrum.

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.442 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:50:11.442 --> 00:50:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So I
could get a tantrum

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.646 align:middle line:84%
and anybody's kid go
out in 45 seconds.

00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:16.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Because I'm
setting my intention

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:21.552 align:middle line:84%
on not trying to
get on to shut up.

00:50:21.552 --> 00:50:22.853 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to set my intention

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:27.458 align:middle line:84%
to the good reason why the
flare up is second place.

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:30.828 align:middle line:84%
Is it about being heard
or is it about choice?

00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:32.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you can
use this in anything,

00:50:32.463 --> 00:50:34.765 align:middle line:84%
you can use as an
interpersonal relationships

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.800 align:middle line:84%
with work relationships,
et cetera.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.869 align:middle line:90%
There's huge difference.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So here is to say a
general graph here that says,

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:43.707 align:middle line:90%
as the-- you can explain this.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:44.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Oh I
love this slide.

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of
my favorite slides.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.412 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I just sit down
I got like, you know,

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:51.815 align:middle line:84%
I've got three kids and
stepdaughter and, you know,

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
two boys, 11 and
they're about 12 and 7.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.689 align:middle line:84%
You know, I said, you
know, what are their needs,

00:50:58.689 --> 00:51:01.058 align:middle line:84%
when are they coming on
screen, when are they--

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
when is the needs to
development piece and I looked

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.995 align:middle line:84%
at the research that
was out there to

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:08.398 align:middle line:84%
and I really put this list
together to really get to sense

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.834 align:middle line:84%
that these are the need
you're really working on.

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:14.805 align:middle line:84%
And with parent groups, you
know, even in a parent groups

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:18.909 align:middle line:84%
or in business groups, when
does the need for respect,

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:21.545 align:middle line:90%
when does when come online

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.381 align:middle line:84%
that a kid can really
understand that?

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.716 align:middle line:90%
Understand respect.

00:51:25.716 --> 00:51:28.952 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even show up
until its 14-- until 13, 14.

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.188 align:middle line:84%
They can barely touch
that concept.

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:34.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: So if a
parent has the expectation

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:37.027 align:middle line:84%
that this kid is
suppose to respect me,

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:40.631 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know what
the word is energetically the

00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:45.769 align:middle line:84%
definition, how it works, how it
is between two different people,

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.738 align:middle line:84%
they're not even
developmentally there.

00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:49.773 align:middle line:84%
It's not even on
the radar screen.

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:50.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's amazing, OK.

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.142 align:middle line:84%
Well here, we're going to
take a look at the video

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:56.547 align:middle line:84%
of you demonstrating
this problem solving idea

00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:57.648 align:middle line:90%
to a group of people.

00:51:57.648 --> 00:51:58.348 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:51:58.348 --> 00:51:59.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle:

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:00.217 align:middle line:90%
[ Background Music ]

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:04.755 align:middle line:84%
The intention of connecting
is really powerful.

00:52:04.755 --> 00:52:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What Bill teaches
is amazingly powerful.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I could find
them a reading program.

00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:12.596 align:middle line:84%
Tell me more about
what you need.

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:15.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill has trained
his mind in a way

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.601 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think I've
ever seen in anybody else.

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.604 align:middle line:84%
>> He truly cares and
he's compassionate

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:23.207 align:middle line:84%
and was really able to
relate to the audience.

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:24.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: CFO is blue.

00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:25.409 align:middle line:90%
COO is green.

00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:30.147 align:middle line:90%
VP of marketing is yellow.

00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:32.149 align:middle line:90%
VP of HR is red.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:36.486 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's speaking to a
group of 500 people or a group

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:39.456 align:middle line:84%
of 15 people in the
executive team,

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:43.193 align:middle line:84%
the thing that I look forward
to is knowledge transfer.

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:46.296 align:middle line:84%
So, the challenge then
is in sales is that each

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:49.366 align:middle line:84%
of this different people
purchase differently.

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:52.869 align:middle line:84%
It's really about the perception
and perspective shift,

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.738 align:middle line:90%
individual by individual.

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:57.674 align:middle line:84%
What I love about what
happened to this process

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.910 align:middle line:90%
of selecting my dominant color,

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.614 align:middle line:84%
it validated what I've always
realized about my self.

00:53:03.614 --> 00:53:05.716 align:middle line:84%
And that is that I'm a
high level net worker.

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:08.552 align:middle line:84%
>> What he does is it's like
giving the magic glasses to put

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:11.421 align:middle line:90%
on that allow you to discern

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.656 align:middle line:84%
between what's actually
happening

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:14.124 align:middle line:84%
and what you thought
was happening.

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.060 align:middle line:84%
'Cause when I'm able to see
and understand what perspective

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.564 align:middle line:84%
that I'm coming from and when
I can see what perspective they

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.733 align:middle line:84%
are coming form, it
means that I don't have

00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:24.801 align:middle line:84%
to force my perspective
on to other people.

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:27.738 align:middle line:84%
>> And the need to sell
'cause it's a good costumer.

00:53:27.738 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Bill has helped me at home
and my relationships with kids

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.278 align:middle line:84%
and my wife help me in my own
personal development and growth.

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:90%
He has helped be a better boss.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.782 align:middle line:84%
And has helped me a
better business owner

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.117 align:middle line:90%
and make more money.

00:53:40.117 --> 00:53:42.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Everybody's thinking
sell and buying decisions

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.054 align:middle line:84%
and goes in various
different ways.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill has a really
interactive teaching style.

00:53:46.023 --> 00:53:47.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Help
us find the money.

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:48.425 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Help us find the money.

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:51.862 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that we were engaged.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:52.596 align:middle line:90%
We got up.

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:53.830 align:middle line:90%
We got out of our seats

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.933 align:middle line:84%
and physically saw
how the brain works.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:59.336 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was a very
simple yet creative approach.

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:03.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Green in going to
end the phone call like this.

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:06.977 align:middle line:84%
Where and when is
the next meeting?

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:09.413 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't matter
who he is talking to.

00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:12.282 align:middle line:84%
He can teach them in a way
that they receive knowledge.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You can retire and
the business can run itself

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:17.587 align:middle line:84%
because you've hired
other people to step in.

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>> He uses a lot of practical
in everyday examples.

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:23.126 align:middle line:84%
He uses a lot of the
language that I think all

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.162 align:middle line:84%
of us have running
in our own heads

00:54:25.162 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:90%
or when we've had confrontations

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.465 align:middle line:84%
with spouses or business
partners.

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> He's really into crowd.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.002 align:middle line:84%
He's getting feedback
from the crowd

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:34.538 align:middle line:84%
to see what kind of
thinkers they are.

00:54:34.538 --> 00:54:37.841 align:middle line:84%
And then, he changes
his presentation style

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.576 align:middle line:90%
to match on the fly.

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:43.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Emotion and
long term memory win

00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:48.218 align:middle line:90%
over logic and future thinking.

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:51.521 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of times with different
companies that I've worked with.

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, they're
still using my material

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.292 align:middle line:90%
as if it happened yesterday.

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:58.528 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's important for
organizations to do this kind

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:01.131 align:middle line:84%
of thing to improve the
results they'll see.

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I would highly
recommend Bill Stierle to go

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.236 align:middle line:90%
into anybody's organization

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and have them increase
their revenues dramatically.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then how
can language be used

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:16.847 align:middle line:84%
to reset the green to
achieve peace and progress.

00:55:16.847 --> 00:55:19.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know, the
best part about learning how

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:22.152 align:middle line:84%
to use language to
reset the brain

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:26.123 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is
the-- when a feeling word,

00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:84%
when a neuropeptide, a molecule
of emotion is associated

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.695 align:middle line:90%
with a need that's causing it.

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:37.834 align:middle line:84%
The person energetically will
get empathy and compassion

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:40.837 align:middle line:84%
and they get the
understanding that you get that.

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:45.542 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, "Boy, see
that you really feel sad

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:48.145 align:middle line:84%
because your need for
connection wasn't met

00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:50.647 align:middle line:90%
when that person said that.

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The person feels yes,
and they get yes.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That actually creates a chemical
response inside the body.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.757 align:middle line:84%
It creates a-- the molecule
gamma-aminobutyric acid

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.193 align:middle line:84%
to be fix in that
calms down the fight,

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.327 align:middle line:90%
flight and freeze response.

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.363 align:middle line:84%
And then, if that's
repeated back--

00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:08.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, that's
the relaxation response

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:09.666 align:middle line:90%
to the body, OK.

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:10.934 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: And then if I,
if say another ones, "Boy,

00:56:12.269 --> 00:56:14.504 align:middle line:84%
I really hear that you really
felt mad because your need

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:84%
for respect wasn't
met with that person.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.941 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?"

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:20.844 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And then if
that's repeated back,

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:24.214 align:middle line:84%
the person then creates
an experience of oxytocin

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:28.285 align:middle line:84%
which causes boding and
understanding and nurturing

00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and acceptance to take place.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's the--
so that's key.

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:32.722 align:middle line:90%
So that's how to get the person

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:36.226 align:middle line:84%
to relax even your
self to relax.

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: That's right.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.528 align:middle line:84%
I'll even say sentences
to myself

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.564 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is bringing
me a bunch of junk.

00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.499 align:middle line:84%
I'll say sentences to
myself 'cause, you know,

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:44.734 align:middle line:84%
I felt confused and I see
there's a lot of pain here

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.069 align:middle line:84%
and I just need some
understanding

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.704 align:middle line:84%
about what this pain
is coming from.

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.673 align:middle line:90%
I calm myself down.

00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:50.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Just by those words?

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yes because
I'm connecting.

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:56.313 align:middle line:84%
It's called-- It's really
the road of empathy.

00:56:56.313 --> 00:57:00.116 align:middle line:84%
The way I define is empathy
only occurs when a feeling word

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:02.652 align:middle line:90%
and a need word is connected

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.821 align:middle line:84%
and then agreed upon
with the word yes.

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:09.593 align:middle line:84%
If I don't get a yes then
empathy it has not taken place.

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:10.827 align:middle line:90%
And don't worry about it.

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.863 align:middle line:84%
Just keep guessing, and
they'll tell you yes.

00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:14.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:15.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: You know,
I'll tell that yes thing.

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:18.635 align:middle line:84%
And then when they do, the brain
actually calms down and then

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:22.305 align:middle line:84%
that it causes state
of restoration.

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:25.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so, the overall
bell curve here is to start off

00:57:25.876 --> 00:57:28.111 align:middle line:84%
as this slide indicates
with awareness

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:29.579 align:middle line:90%
and then understanding.

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:32.048 align:middle line:84%
That moves to acceptance
and then,

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:36.019 align:middle line:84%
the space completely shifts by
feeling heard so that you're,

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:40.123 align:middle line:84%
you listen to, you believe
and then the application

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.259 align:middle line:84%
and transformation
actually happens.

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: Yeah and then
this is a big part of--

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.596 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I love this
slide at the end is that you

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:49.266 align:middle line:84%
and I over this last two
sessions have spent time

00:57:49.266 --> 00:57:51.167 align:middle line:90%
and awareness and understanding.

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.236 align:middle line:84%
We've spent time
about acceptance.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:55.405 align:middle line:84%
OK, here are some things
that are actually working

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:57.574 align:middle line:84%
and have some good
truths to them.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.175 align:middle line:84%
The value shift takes
place its like,

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.077 align:middle line:84%
hey you know, this
step might work.

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.279 align:middle line:84%
You know, this actually
would work.

00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:03.046 align:middle line:90%
It's [multiple speaker]--

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:04.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Try it and yeah--

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: -- let's try
it and watch it works.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.083 align:middle line:84%
Then the practice takes
place for the user

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.919 align:middle line:90%
and I believe it to be so.

00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:12.389 align:middle line:84%
Why? 'Cause I'm getting-- I'm
not dealing with a, you know,

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:14.224 align:middle line:90%
a 40-minute conflict anymore.

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:16.626 align:middle line:90%
I have a three-minuet conflict.

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:17.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:19.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: To think that
might be valuable, you know.

00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:19.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:20.897 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:22.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: I mean, it to check
that line with it, you know,

00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:25.535 align:middle line:84%
and all the sudden this little
flare up, it turns in to three,

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:28.939 align:middle line:84%
20 seconds instead of like
this big upset right there.

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:32.809 align:middle line:84%
And this big upset at the car,
and this big upset at home

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:35.145 align:middle line:84%
and later, and it's like
another's noise such us.

00:58:35.145 --> 00:58:36.046 align:middle line:90%
You know so--

00:58:36.046 --> 00:58:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.515 align:middle line:84%
Right. Well, you have
provided an enormous amount

00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:42.485 align:middle line:84%
of information here and
something that is so simple

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and how to solve conflict.

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.155 align:middle line:90%
It does take practice.

00:58:45.155 --> 00:58:46.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Stierle: It does
take practice.

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And awareness, yeah.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Stierle: Yeah.

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:49.125 align:middle line:90%
The tools of relatively simple.

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is undoing what
we've been taughtmodeled

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.466 align:middle line:84%
from the past and then
just like driving a car

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:59.402 align:middle line:84%
or hitting a baseball or
kicking a soccer ball.

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It just takes some practice.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.906 align:middle line:84%
You know, use your
language a little this way.

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, move the
thing this way.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.075 align:middle line:90%
Oh look at that.

00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:05.842 align:middle line:90%
Work better.

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:90%
That sentence work better.

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.844 align:middle line:90%
Hey, look at that.

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.079 align:middle line:84%
Right, you know it's
like better.

00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:10.981 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I reduced the conflict,
finally.

00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:12.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: If you would like to
watch the replay of my interview

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:16.186 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Stierle, you can go
to gaiamtv.com and share it

00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:17.320 align:middle line:90%
with your friends from there.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.257 align:middle line:84%
And until next, I invite
you to stay inspired.
