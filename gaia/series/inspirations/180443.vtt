there is another way to live.

Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is Anita Sanchez
to share her four sacred gifts.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:10%
They guide us to live
as one human race,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:10%
as our ancestors and our
elders have taught us to live.

Hello.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ANITA SANCHEZ: Hello, Lisa.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're amazing.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
You have this 40-year history
of organizational development

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in the corporate world.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you have this
great deep history

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:90%
in the Native American arts.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about your corporate life.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.024 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- well, I
knew from a little girl

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to grow
up and connect people

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was corporate.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm the first one in my family
to be involved in corporations.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:10%
And so-- yes, for 42 years--

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:10%
I just celebrated-- I've
had my own business.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And I go in.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And I consult from the
C-suite to newbies coming in.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically sharing about
how to work and live together--

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
how to really appreciate each
other's gifts-- the differences

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:90%
as well as the similarities.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so needed.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So were you the first in
your family to get a PhD

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.757 align:middle line:84%
and to go to that level
of schooling as well?

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, I was first
in quite a few things.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.919 align:middle line:84%
So yes, definitely, I'm a first
generation to go to college

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and then going on to get my
master's-- and first to get

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:90%
a PhD.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have 120
first cousins, so--

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- so when I go
back for reunions and that,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm always reminded.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, I
don't even know anymore.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:90%
They're the kids' kids.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:10%
And they're like,
you let me know

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:10%
that I could go and do this.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:10%
You were the one.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:10%
So it's amazing responsibility.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:10%
But I'll tell you,
it's a much bigger joy.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.885 align:middle line:90%
It's so wonderful.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:22.773 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It must be, to
inspire generations.

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- yes.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's incredible--

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --Dr. Anita.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little
bit about that.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
42 years ago, you
started your own business

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
as a Native American
Mexican-American woman.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:90%
How was that?

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.166 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, I had
a lot of disbelievers.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the faculty, when I
said what I was going to do--

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:84%
not all of them, but
some of them were like--

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and I know they were coming
out of their own story,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:90%
as we all do.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.779 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
really important

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to listen to each other, to
expand our stories and find out

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.636 align:middle line:90%
there's another possibility.

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they said,
you can't do that.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, you're going
to go and work internationally?

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, that's
what I'm going to do.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, no, no, no.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You go to other colleges, other
universities than Colorado,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.039 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get
a faculty position.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Because a Mexican and
Native American woman

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.329 align:middle line:84%
is not going to own
her own business

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and travel all over the world.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm 23.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm traveling.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I find myself in
Singapore, working

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
with women whose countries
are at war with each other,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
doing visionaring work
and peace and development.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm in corporations-- Hewlett
Packard, Dupont, AT&T.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.773 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What would you do?

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
What would you do
when you get there?

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, you always
contract with the executives.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, one of my
first ones, sitting there.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I think it was
26 in this particular client I'm

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
thinking of.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.088 align:middle line:90%
And he's looking at me.

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:45.912 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I knew
you were a woman.

00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew from your name,
you're probably Mexican.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
You look Native American.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
But you're so young.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to teach me?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking at
him and saying, I don't know.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to find out?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
And he just was like, yes--

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:90%
yes, let's stay.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, but I teach
them all sorts of things--

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
of how to build effective teams,
how to go inside and find out

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
what really is your purpose--

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
what it is that
really is calling you.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
all sorts of crises

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
in corporations-- in any
business, whatever size it is.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.742 align:middle line:84%
But when you're clear about
your vision and your purpose,

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
when you know what's
being called--

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and that can shift over time--

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.762 align:middle line:84%
you're able to
move through those.

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you go
into environments

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
where there is a need for
organizational development

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and consulting.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's usually
something that's broken.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes,
there usually is.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Usually-- because
one of my big loves

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:90%
is diversity and inclusion.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's generally, oh,
we're losing the women.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
We're losing the Black folks.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
We can't attract the Latinos.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.335 align:middle line:84%
Oh my-- and they're
expanding all over the world.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get them
to work with each other

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:90%
across the differences.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, they're racial,
gender, sexual orientation--

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
but they move beyond that
too into what I would call--

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
it's more subtle, but
ever so presence--

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
which is the differences
in world views, which

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
makes it or breaks
it of whether it's

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be easy
to dance together,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to make those profits, to
obtain and exceed those goals.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And often, there
is history attached to it--

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
decades, generational
history that's

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
attached to these
different perspectives.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
How do you address that
to bring everyone together

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:90%
for a greater whole?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- well,
first, you listen.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
You allow-- you welcome it.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So I remember, in
the early days--

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
it's going to date
me a little bit--

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.201 align:middle line:84%
but when I would go
into corporations

00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and I would get the contract,
they'd go, before we sign now,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:84%
there's two things
you can never do here.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to agree.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I'd go, well, what are those?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And they'd repeat
those for decades.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk about politics.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
These are US international
corporations.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk about politics.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can't talk
about religion.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And I would say, fine.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to talk about
politics, although we can

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
have those side conversations.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But when you say religion, I
think people confuse things.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I will always deal
with spirituality.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
We all come in with spirit.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
We choose religions.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.876 align:middle line:84%
I can not talk about
religion, but I can't not

00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:24.875 align:middle line:90%
talk about spirituality.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And I'd
lose some contracts.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So some of my colleagues
go, why did you do that?

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Those were big!

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be like,
because if I'm there

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to help them become
whole, effective, then

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I can't cut out a
whole piece of--

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You-- who you are.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --this
other being, right?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And who I
am-- so it wouldn't work.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:90%
But it changed.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
By 2002, I never
heard that again.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.417 align:middle line:84%
And in those who
did bring it up,

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I'd say what I just said to you.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And they'd go, OK.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.612 align:middle line:90%
So things are changing--

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great to know.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.069 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --to understand
we're spiritual beings too.

00:06:58.069 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're physical,
mental, emotional.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But this spirit is
really critical.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you didn't just
learn this from going to school

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and getting your PhD.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: No.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little
bit about your family,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:90%
your background.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.592 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, well,
I was really fortunate.

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
In growing up, being
part indigenous--

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Aztecan-- maternal
grandmother is Aztecan.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:90%
And so she would always--

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
from a little girl, I remember
doing ceremony and just

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
wonderful things
about understanding

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:90%
that we're spirit.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're spirit--
we're reinforced

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
by connection to everything.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It just popped up for me.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.624 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I loved so much

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
was, when we were all
little-- a bunch of us--

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.998 align:middle line:84%
and we were playing
outside all day

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
long-- she got us
up really early.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.127 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the sun
hit those sunflowers,

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:90%
we stood over there.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And she had to stand there for
a while-- like, five minutes.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
We were little, so we
couldn't stand too long.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And then we'd play.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think, it must
have been every hour or so.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
She would come out.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And we'd turn.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And that day, I
experienced what it

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
was to be connected
to a sunflower--

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --to understand,
no matter what was happening

00:07:59.180 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
in the day--

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
whether I fell down or
somebody was fussy or everybody

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
was having fun-- that you
can always look to the sun.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
understanding or listening

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to yourself but
also understanding

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual connection to the
earth, as well, was so power--

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many
experiences like that.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how class--

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.616 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And yeah--
so it's wonderful.

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, the kids
are staring at the phones

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've lost that touch,
that connection with nature

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.827 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:08:26.827 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And that's part
of what, definitely, we

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
need to bring back.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not giving up my cell phone.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.408 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I'm not
giving up my computer.

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
However, I was actually at
Google Singularity University.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And this
popped out of my mouth.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go ahead and
say it, since it's already

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:90%
sort of public anyway.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.779 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at this crowd.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And they brought up
this whole thing.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know,
you can't Google wisdom.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And there was a silence.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.556 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody
started laughing.

00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
understand what I mean?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:90%
You can Google it.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And it'll give you a definition.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But wisdom doesn't
come that way.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:90%
So put the phones down.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Put the computers down,
for little bits of time.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And reconnect with yourself
first and then with nature

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:90%
and other two-leggeds and--

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of experiences
like that little--

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:84%
with sage elders and mainly
my Aztecan grandmother.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to make it
sound like it was all rosy.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It was wonderful.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
there was a dark secret

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that I was keeping in my life of
years of sexual abuse from age

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
4 to 13.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is def--

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.363 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --was also there too.

00:09:34.363 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a topic that
I want to dive into with you.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I want you to
take a look at Anita's journey,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:84%
from the corporate culture
to her wonderful wisdom

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:90%
from her elders.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this to
understand the story

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.185 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:10%
- My kindergarten teacher
asked, what are you

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:10%
going to be when you grow up?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Here, draw it.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
My friends stood holding
drawings of firemen, doctors,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
mommies.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I knew what I was going
to be when I grew up.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
From my dreams, I saw people
connecting their hands

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and hearts, circling the earth.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Everyone laughed.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But I knew, this is what I was
going to be when I grew up.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
As an adult, I was
living that dream,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
filled with lots of
experiences and connections

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to people all over the world.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I earned my PhD and was
training and coaching

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
leaders and their teams,
bringing their minds and hearts

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But after many years,
my favorite executives

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
who championed women and
men of different backgrounds

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
began to ask, why
am I doing this?

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It hit me like a rock.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:84%
It echoed what I
was feeling inside.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:10%
In 1995, I found
elders to talk to,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:10%
while volunteering at
the American Indian

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:10%
Science and Engineering
Society's annual conference.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I asked them, what am
I supposed to be doing?

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Should I be doing
something else?

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:84%
On the second night
of the conference,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
we all gathered to
receive special gifts that

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
came from the North,
South, East, and West.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Grandmother and
Grandfather make no mistakes.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:90%
We each have a role to play.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We are all part of
one Mother, one Earth.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We have been living in a
time of a great winter.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, we must
prepare for the spring.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
There was silence.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he began naming the
four gifts for all humanity,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to help prepare ourselves
and our communities.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:10%
From the North-- the power
to forgive the unforgivable.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:10%
From the West--
the power of unity.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:10%


00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:10%
From the East-- the
gift of healing.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:84%
From the South--
the gift of hope.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:10%
Afterwards, I saw Henrietta
and another elder, Phil

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:10%
Lane, Senior.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't have all
the answers, do I?

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:10%
No, Anita.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:10%
You think that the worst that
has ever happened to our people

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:10%
was to have been murdered and
to have our sacred land stolen.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:10%
You are wrong.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:10%
The worst thing that can happen
to our people or to any people

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:10%
is to lose hope.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Her words were like
a spear of truth

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
that hit and opened my heart.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Those Four Gifts
have supported me

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
through good times
and tough times.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Forgiving my parents
healed the little girl

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
who was abused by my
father from age 4 to 13.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:10%
I replaced the hurt and shame
with gratitude to my parents

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:10%
for giving me life.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.378 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
You had experienced this
love-hate relationship

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.056 align:middle line:90%
with your father, kind of.

00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, well, and--

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's talk about it.

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, and so
that's so important,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, it taught me
one of these gifts that we'll

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
be getting into,
which is forgiveness,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
because I know a lot about that.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So yes, from age 4 to 13, I
was molested by my father.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And I kept silent about it.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
There were wonderful
people and different times

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
that I could have
said something.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed silent.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: For fear--

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I think, multiple layers.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
For fear that I
would lose my family.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
My brothers and sisters and my
mom were so important to me.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what would happen.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
He did say that,
if I kept quiet,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't bother
my younger sister.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But that was a lie,
because later--

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:90%
later-- so there was that.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
There was shame--
a lot of shame,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
like, that other people probably
weren't experiencing anything

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.137 align:middle line:90%
And so it was like, oh my gosh.

00:14:23.137 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I had to keep this secret.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And it only really end--

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't even own that
it was me, growing

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and becoming more
mature and understanding

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that this was about my freedom.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But my father was
murdered when I was 13.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was mistaken--
it was racial.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.947 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of fits
with what's continuing

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
to happen in this country.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But he went for a
beer after work.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And early that day, a white man
and a black man, in the '60s,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:90%
were having an argument.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.907 align:middle line:84%
The white man returned and
saw my father sitting there

00:14:52.907 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and fired two bullets
through his head

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and killed him on
the spot, thinking--

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thinking it
was the other man.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.628 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Thinking
it was the other man.

00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And you can imagine--

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a 13-year-old-- I was dealing
with both the sadness that, oh,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
my gosh, my--

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
there were times

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that I wished that
he were gone--

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:90%
the unthinkable.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you heard that
news, what did you feel?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, when the
police came to the door,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I was with my mom.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And they invited themselves in.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I remember them
saying, Mrs. Sanchez, there

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:90%
was an accident that happened.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And do you know anyone who
would want to harm your husband?

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, in my
head, thinking, oh my gosh.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
I wanted-- I wanted him gone.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they told
what had happened,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
how he had been killed and
the circumstances of it.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, at that point,
just all these different

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
things-- confusion, I think,
is the biggest thing--

00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
fear, sadness, confusion,
wanting to support my mom.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until years
later that I realized,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
when I did talk to my mom,
when I confronted her,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
at 21, that we both realized
that we were experiencing

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
some of the same
things in that moment.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't know, but
she had a sense something

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%
was not right with him.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.091 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense, so it was--

00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At that moment--

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --a hard thing.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --your father left.

00:16:28.285 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Your violator left.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- yes.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So did you start to
feel, in any way, a little bit

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:90%
more freedom?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Or did you hold onto that--

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, no-- no.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --for a long time?

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.383 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And so this is an
important part of the story

00:16:41.383 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
too that lots of people
don't get to hear.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:90%
But I thought, it would be--

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I would now be able to be free.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:90%
This is what I wanted.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But the mind-- so all the
images and things continued.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So I did do what, unfortunately,
is still on the rise

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the world,
which is teen suicide--

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
suicide, period,
actually-- adults now, too.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So at about six months
after his death,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to end
it, because it just felt like--

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:90%
the images aren't gone.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And I still hadn't
told anybody about it.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And luckily-- fortunately--

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel like-- oh,
Spirit was with me--

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
I took aspirins-- a lot of them.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.712 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work.

00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of absurd in a way.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I remember just
thinking it all out

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.867 align:middle line:84%
and putting a trash can by the
bed, because my two sisters

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and I shared a room.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
I don't want to make

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.313 align:middle line:90%
a mess for them and stuff.

00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what are
you talking about?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Uh-huh, you're
out of your right mind.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --as a child.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But I appreciate you
asking about this

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it up
because, again, I

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
think what happens-- what's
happened in our society is

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:90%
we're not talking about things.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
We're just going into being
divided or paralysis, ignorance

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
or ignoring.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we really need
to do is come together

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
about what really is happening.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes-- yes.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I get very frustrated
with the news when

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:90%
it reports on the events of--

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --the gymnastics coach
and how many girls came forward

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and how many--

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --years he
was able to get away

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
with that, after so many parents
were told by their children.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And there were lawsuits.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And he continued.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same with
the USC doctor.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think, it is
journalistically

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
irresponsible for the news
to report on these subjects

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and move to the
next story and not--

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I agree.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --to give solutions.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
take this opportunity

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand
what to do.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
In hindsight, what would you
tell that 13-year-old you?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- yes.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, I
would have to say,

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.490 align:middle line:84%
part of self-love
and acceptance,

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
which is a process of
forgiving yourself and healing,

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is that I wouldn't tell her
that she did anything wrong--

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that I understand you did that.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
However, what I did, in the
process, begin to understand--

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
as I laid there writhing
and vomiting and stuff,

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I, all of a sudden,
saw my grandparents,

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
my Aztecan grandmother.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw the rocking chair that
my grandfather made for me.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.529 align:middle line:84%
And he only made two
of them in his life,

00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%
for two of his grandkids.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And he had many.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, at that
moment, oh, please--

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
please, whatever--
let me stay here.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I did exactly what
my elders had been

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
teaching me is that
illusion of separateness.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So in my pain, I believed
that I was alone.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever alone.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that-- and I
say that everywhere I go--

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --is that none
of us are ever alone.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:90%
We do feel lonely at times.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the human condition.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: But
we're never alone--

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.229 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if you weren't here
with me, I wouldn't be--

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm breathing.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Those trees did something.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Those plants-- that ocean--
to have that sun shining--

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:90%
you always have someone.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And there were so many people
who tried to reach out,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.904 align:middle line:84%
who understood something
else was going on.

00:20:09.904 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't
take their hand,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
because I just believed
that I was lost

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:90%
in the illusion of the pain.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And when people are in pain,
they do need something else,

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a spiritual
link, whether it's

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:90%
another human being.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It can be an animal, a pet.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It can be nature.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, all of
those things are here.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
All those good medicines
are here for us.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.539 align:middle line:90%
And we need to just get present.

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, the
biggest thing for me

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.195 align:middle line:84%
that happened, really, was
I started college at 16.

00:20:41.195 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
scholarship to come out

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
to the University of Colorado.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I got out
of a desert into this oasis.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
indigenous people here and so

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
many Mexicans here than
where I grew up in Missouri.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just had all these people,
like, shining a mirror on me,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:90%
saying, wow.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:90%
You're wonderful.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, never saying
anything about the truth

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:90%
of the other part of my life.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
That began to help
me lower what I

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
call my shield, my
armor of separateness.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And it started coming down--

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
not real fast.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:90%
But it started coming down.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, part
of why we need to heal,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
we need to speak of this,
have it acknowledged,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
do all the work is
because of love of self.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.496 align:middle line:84%
You can't receive it, unless
you've loved yourself.

00:21:32.496 --> 00:21:33.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:33.295 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And it's so
huge when you realize that.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But do you know
what happens when you

00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:90%
speak of this to another woman?

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%
They say, me too.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, they do.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I've had lots say
that to me over--

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:84%
the decades that I've worked in
the corporations, those women

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
there, as well as women
in the communities,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
as well as women in warring
countries-- it's all over.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes-- yes.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And I think-- I feel--

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that this period of
#MeToo has to be brought

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
about into the awareness
of the universal culture,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
in order to begin the healing.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think, it's going to
last for a little while--

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It is.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --before
the healing begins--

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It is.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think--

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --unfortunately.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.996 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --what
we have to allow

00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is for it to happen in
all its diverse ways.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
However, the voice coming out
so strong-- it makes me happy.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems horrible to
say, happy about that--

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
not happy about the violence.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%
The violence needs to end.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But the only way it's going
to end is by us speaking of it

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and having allies-- have
men too, who said, no, no.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's for women supporting
other women, instead of saying,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
don't talk about that--

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --instead
saying, thank you.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and that art
of bringing awareness to it

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and vocalizing, in a safe
space, in a way that it's

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
very supported, that
you can feel safe.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Safety is the most important
part of awareness and speaking

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But when that happens,
in that safe environment,

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:90%
the healing can start to begin.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And we also train
the entire culture

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:84%
of how women should be treated,
how men should be treated.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of confusion

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
now amongst how men speak
to women and vice versa.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I saw this poll that came
out about men and women

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And there was about 80 polled.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
anonymous comments were--

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
a man says, I don't
speak to a woman

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
alone any longer unless
another person is present.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I will not hug anyone
in the workplace.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I keep everything limited
to no physical contact,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:90%
before or after work.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's all changing.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.504 align:middle line:84%
But there aren't any
real solutions yet.

00:23:44.504 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel about that?

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, that's
a natural action,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because the men
are really trying

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to protect themselves too.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure, of course.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: So it's
really a natural thing.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.699 align:middle line:90%
But they will move through it.

00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that happen in
corporations where, initially,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:84%
when it became clear
about no harassment--

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be a
no-tolerance zone for any kind

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of mistreatment and stuff--

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
but the healing-- we
are men and women.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:90%
We have some differences.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But I will say, from
indigenous elders,

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
from different traditions
all over the world,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:90%
we are also very much alike.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And for us to be connected, to
understand that we are spirit,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
we're energy, we're
physical bodies--

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But to really be connected, then
we need to engage each other.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And so to stay in
that space won't work.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So four things I
found, as I listened

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:90%
to elders all over the world--

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to be able to heal that,
to heal our relationship--

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
it's not just with each
other as men and women--

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --but it's actually
with ourselves-- is that we

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:90%
need these four elements.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of different
ways they go about them.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But the four elements
are listening--

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:90%
we need to listen, not speak.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
That means, no talking.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what's going
on inside yourself.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And then listen to others.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Listen to nature.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Listen-- big one.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Listening is not nothing.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Listening is something.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Active listening.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes--

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --really
being present.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the second thing is to
have supportive relationships.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:20.151 align:middle line:84%
So no one's asking someone
to be in a situation that's

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
not respectful, where you're
not being treated with dignity.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look for those
supportive relationships.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
However, we think
supportive relationships

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.904 align:middle line:84%
are all about just being
comfortable, are all about--

00:25:30.904 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm only going
to talk to you, Lisa,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
if you totally agree with me.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's absurd!

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: So people
who care about you--

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the third thing is
unconditional love.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And some people, when I say
that one, that I found that,

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
they go--

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
don't believe too

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
much in unconditional love--
maybe a mother to her child

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:90%
or a father to a child.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: The reality
is, unconditional love

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:90%
is really critical.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you discover
that, no matter what,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:90%
you are unconditionally loved--

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
because just by virtue of being
part of this hoop of life--

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that is an incredible
power source for you.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow!

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:90%
It gets rid of judgment.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah, and
the fourth thing--

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:10%
which is why I love
and appreciate you

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:10%
having me here-- is
that it's about getting

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:10%
into positive action.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:10%
All this things
arising right now--

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:10%
we're all making choices.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
We think, oh, I'm
staying out of that.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.657 align:middle line:90%
Your silence is a choice.

00:26:27.657 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:90%
You're speaking out.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:90%
How you do that is a choice.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:90%
We're all impacting.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And so this awareness
that's expanding all over,

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:84%
not allowing anything
uncovered, is an important time.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And from prophecies in
different parts of the world,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:90%
we're in that time.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a time to lead from
our hearts, to be aware,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:90%
to use all of those things.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a particularly--
no matter if the ceremony is

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
coming from South Africa,
Alaska, Aboriginals, women--

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
all of them are saying,
women, it is our time to rise.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It is not about doing in men
or not having them be there.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It is our turn.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:84%
It is our time to
bring back into balance

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what--

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
the prophecy says?

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: That's what
the prophecies say.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And they say them
in different ways,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:90%
in different parts of the world.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In different cultures.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.995 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: But they're all
rising at the same time.

00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The rise
of the feminine.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: The rise
of the feminine.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.447 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love
this idea of unity.

00:27:24.447 --> 00:27:25.246 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we have,
actually, a clip of your uncle

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:84%
talking to you about and
teaching about this very thing.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.480 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to see this clip.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back and
talk with Anita about it.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:10%
- When I was 6-years-old, oh,
how I loved being squeezed

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:10%
into our old blue Plymouth, with
my five brothers and sisters

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:10%
and my mom and dad.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Every year, we'd
go several times.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:10%
We drive out of Kansas
City, into the countryside,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:10%
to visit my special relatives.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:10%
We'd pull up in front of
my aunt and uncle's house,

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:10%
with its white wooded siding.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:10%
And even before we entered,
I could smell the food--

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.205 align:middle line:10%
the potatoes, the
flatbread, the beans.

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Oh!

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:10%
My family hugs a lot.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:10%
So we had to hug everybody
before we went outside to play.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:10%
But what I remember most
was, late in the afternoon,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:10%
coming back inside and
sitting in a circle,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:10%
in order to listen to
my uncle share stories

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:10%
about how we were all
connected to one another.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:10%
He would lower his eyes.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:10%
We would all lean forward.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:10%
And then, with this calm yet
strong voice, he would say,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:10%
this is what it means to
be a whole human being,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:10%
to live knowing that
we are all connected.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:10%
We are all one.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And then he would
make a huge circle.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And in that circle, he
would place the people.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.170 align:middle line:10%
And he would say, we are
part of all the people,

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:10%
from the red, brown, black,
white, and yellow direction.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:10%
We are part of the Earth--

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:10%
the water, the
animals, the birds--

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:10%
all the elements.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:10%
We are part of Spirit--

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:10%
Grandmother and Grandfather.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:10%
There are no mistakes.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:10%
Everyone and everything
has a place in this circle.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:10%
We knew to be quiet, to not miss
a word of what my uncle said.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.195 align:middle line:10%
And then he'd look
each of us in the eyes.

00:29:32.195 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:10%
And he's say, now, if
you hurt another person

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.200 align:middle line:10%
with your thoughts,
words, or actions,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.340 align:middle line:10%
you not only hurt that person,
you hurt all the people,

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.260 align:middle line:10%
the Earth, and the Spirit.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:10%
And if you hurt the Earth
by polluting the water,

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:10%
you not only hurt the water.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:10%
You hurt all the Earth,
the Spirit, and the people.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:10%
And if you hurt the Spirit by
not honoring the sacredness

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:10%
and connection of all
life, then you hurt,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:10%
also, the people and the Earth.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:10%
To be a whole human being
means to live in harmony

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:10%
and connection with all life.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:10%
Believe me, if you were in
that circle, you'd be saying--

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:10%
just like I did--

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.560 align:middle line:10%
I don't ever want to
hurt a person, the Earth,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:10%
or the Spirit.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.310 align:middle line:10%
Afterwards, we'd all sit
down and eat and enjoy

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:10%
this delicious food.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And then, sleepily,
we'd get back in the car

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:10%
and go back to the city.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:10%
As a kid, I thought everybody
had aunts and uncles,

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:10%
grandparents-- the
elders who taught

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:10%
us these important
instructions of life.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:10%
But as an adult, I
learned it was different.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:10%
For you see, my uncle was
Native American, indigenous

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:10%
to this land--

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Osage-- a wise and loving elder.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:10%
And I realized how blessed I
was to have him in my life.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And it would be a blessing
to have him today.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.360 align:middle line:10%
Because today, way
too often, we act

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:10%
as if we have no connections.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We act as if we
have no relations.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Thank you.

00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I love seeing my
messages from my uncle.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:90%
He's been gone for some time.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:90%
But he's not.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
He's in here.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.704 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He is-- yes.

00:31:26.704 --> 00:31:27.994 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's just wonderful.

00:31:27.994 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had such
incredible teachers.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.245 align:middle line:84%
And what he was just
saying is unity.

00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:84%
He talks about unity, which is a
part of the four sacred gifts--

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness-- the
ability to forgive,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:84%
which we talked a
little bit about.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, and
the power of unity--

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:10%
the unity is going
to take all of us.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:10%
Because as he said, the
hoop of life is everything.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We're so used to-- in
our modern science,

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.692 align:middle line:84%
we've just separated,
separated, separated.

00:31:55.692 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just in science.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.050 align:middle line:84%
In so many things, we've
just separated, separated.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.637 align:middle line:84%
And it's to love all of
that, because all of that's

00:32:01.637 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:90%
in the hoop of life.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's in the hoop
and life, understanding

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
that world view--

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I love it when I go
into a corporate room

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and I have clients who--

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:90%
like, they get it.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, it is all connected.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It makes it so much simpler.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:21.054 align:middle line:84%
Because to have to get rid of
that illusion of separateness--

00:32:21.054 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Separateness-- yeah.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And all
the science now--

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.408 align:middle line:84%
whether you have physics,
biology-- it's all showing,

00:32:25.408 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
we're so connected.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that great?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.285 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:28.285 --> 00:32:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah!.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And the
elders were telling us

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.823 align:middle line:90%
that since we were little.

00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:35.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they would say,
be careful of what you say.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Be careful of what you
think, because you're already

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:84%
affecting, by
having that go out.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It goes out.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, we have
HeartMath and other sciences

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
showing that we are
impacting each other.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what is the Lakota
phrase of all my relations?

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah,
[SPEAKING LAKOTA]---- yes--

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:90%
all my relations.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
We're all related.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we come from that,
it's a responsibility.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's incredible power.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.645 align:middle line:84%
And as a little
girl, I felt that.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But, like-- wow!

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:84%
When they said that--
like, I'm really powerful.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd like-- oh, with
power comes responsibility.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm not kind
to you or to the Earth,

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.777 align:middle line:90%
then I've broken that unity.

00:33:10.777 --> 00:33:11.576 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow!

00:33:11.576 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:90%
You were taught that as a child.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.216 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah-- yeah, so--

00:33:14.216 --> 00:33:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fantastic.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's talk a little
bit about responsibility

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.055 align:middle line:84%
And you are a major part
of the Pachamama Alliance.

00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, I love--

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:26.317 align:middle line:84%
so Pachamama-- when people
hear that word, especially

00:33:26.317 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
in this country, they
think of Mother Earth,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.540 align:middle line:90%
which is wonderful.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But Pachamama is
actually a Quichoa word.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And it means the sacred
presence of the Earth, the sky,

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:90%
the universe, and all time.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, so when
we talk about Pachamama,

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that's holding that world
view of it is all connected.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes me really
excited and happy about that.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And so Pachamama is
one of the places

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that I give a lot of my time,
because they have really

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:90%
honored the sacred wisdom.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They draw on that
from the Amazon,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
where I'm about to go in
a couple of weeks and--

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --get really
immersed into understanding

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:90%
that we are part of the Earth.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.389 align:middle line:90%
The earth is part of us.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.513 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there's a lot
of devastation happening

00:34:12.513 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:90%
with our Earth, Anita.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: There is.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: From the fracking
to the drilling, of course,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
as you know, our
environment, our ozone--

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.680 align:middle line:90%
it is being rolled back.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It is.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's really important.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth--
Pachamama is letting

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
us know all the ways
in which we have not

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
treated her with dignity,
treated ourselves with dignity.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.716 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
of this is connected.

00:34:38.716 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if, as a
human being, I'm

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
not treating another
with dignity and then

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not treating the Earth--

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.670 align:middle line:90%
it all needs to be addressed.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I thank the people
who are watching.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever part of this sacred
hoop that you are addressing,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:90%
it's important.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But equally important
is to understand--

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
you may care more
about the animals.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Others may be
addressing children.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Others may be getting rid of
violence-- but to understand,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:90%
it's all connected.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all about all our
relations coming back

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
into harmony and balance
with one another.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:90%
We get to do that in our time.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:90%
What a great time to live!

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We get to.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's also organizations
that are doing the opposite.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.343 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, there are.

00:35:19.343 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does it
work in your community

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
hold the space,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:84%
where there are
devastating things that

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.043 align:middle line:84%
are happening at the same
time you're holding the space?

00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
How do you make
that voice louder?

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: OK, so I
think a perfect example

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of that was a recent one,
which was Standing Rock.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And Standing Rock was
about coming in a spirit way,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.420 align:middle line:84%
standing for the water,
for all human beings,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
not just for the people
there in the Dakotas,

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:90%
but for all beings--

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to re-bring that awareness
that water is sacred.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's standing for.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that one does
it, not doing the same thing

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:90%
back-- violence.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But it also doesn't
mean doing nothing.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It means that you do
this in a way that

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.650 align:middle line:84%
is respectful-- dignity,
relationship with one another

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.407 align:middle line:84%
So that means you do get
active, in whatever way that

00:36:12.407 --> 00:36:13.240 align:middle line:90%
makes sense to you--

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --politically,
socially, in your family,

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.640 align:middle line:90%
It's about action.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.380 align:middle line:84%
That GPS does not
work unless we move.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:90%
We got to move.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.835 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: It's no going
to tell you, oh, I'm

00:36:24.835 --> 00:36:25.835 align:middle line:90%
off-course or on-course.

00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:90%
You've got to move.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did it work though?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Did the people standing--
what were the results?

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: OK, so
yes and not totally.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: What did work is that
not only the young women who

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:84%
started running and started
bring the awareness about

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:90%
the sacred water--

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:84%
it attracted all
these elders from all

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:84%
over-- not only the
US-- all over the world.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But it began deepening
a movement that

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
started in the
heart of the Amazon,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:90%
which was the Rights of Nature.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:90%
So Ecuador-- I'm digressing.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But Rights of Nature--
the first country

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth who has the
Rights of Natures is Ecuador.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have Standing
Rock saying, water is sacred.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:84%
From that positive experience in
Ecuador and then Standing Rock

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and people coming together--
indigenous and non-indigenous--

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
has spurred on a movement
all over the world

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
of Rights of Natures.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:90%
So we have cities in Europe.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:90%
We have cities in our country.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that--

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We have
other countries saying--

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --Rights of Nature?

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.736 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Rights
of Nature-- that

00:37:29.736 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is saying that that water,
that river, has a right to be.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:84%
It has a right to be present,
for the sake of itself

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and for all life
that it supports.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So it comes right out
of indigenous wisdom.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We have a thing called
Seven Generations.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, each generation
is about 100 years.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And it actually got encode
in the Iroquois Nation.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And what that became
so important--

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's held by other
indigenous people,

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:84%
other parts of world--
was that everything

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I think, everything I do,
I think of it's impact

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
not just now but at least seven
generations going forward.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I do, I'm thinking
about not only your daughter

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
but your daughter's daughter,
your daughter's daughter,

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that river, and the
tributaries, and all of it.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we operate, thinking
that-- instead of short-term,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.100 align:middle line:90%
greed, results--

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing--

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:90%
then we're shifting.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.622 align:middle line:90%
And people are realizing that.

00:38:33.622 --> 00:38:34.830 align:middle line:90%
They're starting to look at--

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
fracking?

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we need energy.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's all of us.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.095 align:middle line:90%
We point fingers at each other.

00:38:41.095 --> 00:38:42.720 align:middle line:84%
When you point at
somebody else, you're

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
pointing three back at
yourself, because we're all

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:90%
responsible for this.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
However, they're starting
to see, well, wait a minute.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:90%
But it used this much water.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's toxic.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They say it's safe.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's right
next to our schoo--

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:90%
so it's all getting unraveled.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
are really looking

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to wisdom in themselves, in
nature, and to the wisdom

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:84%
keepers of these
various traditions who

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:84%
held onto these for thousands
of years for all of us.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank god.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and the voices
are being heard more.

00:39:12.485 --> 00:39:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Before it was just an
Erin Brockovich or someone.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:15.855 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:39:15.855 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But now, there are
many Erin Brockoviches.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.663 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: There are many.

00:39:18.663 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're all being
heard in a way that has--

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.965 align:middle line:84%
I think, because of the
power of social media.

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's true.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's why we
don't even want to--

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.040 align:middle line:84%
we separate, like, oh, get rid
of that technology and this.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Or we're going to depend
only on technology.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Forget about people.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.506 align:middle line:84%
You can do whatever you
want, because techno--

00:39:33.506 --> 00:39:34.980 align:middle line:90%
that's more separation.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:90%
We need to work this together.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.770 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, social media--

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.350 align:middle line:84%
people wouldn't know
what was going on

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.090 align:middle line:90%
unless we have social media.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, there was a movie
or something or an article--

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- yes,
but not in the moment.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We have a possibility,
because we can only

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:90%
live now, to be present.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And that social media--
we can get it in the now.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
That's so great.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:90%
It's so great.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.412 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the four gifts are
the power of forgiveness--

00:40:00.412 --> 00:40:02.745 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah, the power
to forgive the unforgivable--

00:40:02.745 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Forgive
the unforgivable.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes-- the power
of unity is the second gift.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The third gift is
the power of healing.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.034 align:middle line:90%
And healing is a process.

00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, we want
to say, it's an event.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.324 align:middle line:84%
I want it to--
give me that shot.

00:40:15.324 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm done with that.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
our lives-- mm--

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.820 align:middle line:84%
probably take a
lot more sometimes.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is a very big
need for instant healing.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
When you're sick-- I want
it just to get better.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if you
hurt yourself--

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I just want it to get better.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have some type of
a surgery or something--

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I just want it to be over.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:90%
What is that process?

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah, that's
a dis-honoring too--

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
it is a process--

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:84%
the healing-- our bodies,
our minds, spirits.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about
getting patient.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.355 align:middle line:90%
But with the modern--

00:40:44.355 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:84%
just, fast, fast, fast, move,
moving-- we get into that.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
to slow that down,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
then we'll be able to really
see with clearer vision

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and allow the healing
to happen more fully--

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:90%
all of that much better.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.245 align:middle line:84%
So I think part of it's,
we're undoing that too,

00:40:59.245 --> 00:41:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to understand that healing
is a process as well.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can we still heal
when the devastating things

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.792 align:middle line:90%
are still happening?

00:41:07.792 --> 00:41:09.375 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I keep
going back to this.

00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But could you
heal amidst the trauma

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:90%
you were going through?

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:84%
The healing really can't begin
until the trauma is over.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I think
that's an allusion too.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.747 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: So let me just say--

00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:90%
not going into the depths.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But I remember one of the
times when I was being abused

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and I was actually being beaten.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going up to my
room and just really in pain.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And there was blood on my legs.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.344 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
blotting it and trying

00:41:38.344 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:84%
to be careful not
to use something

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:90%
that it would cause a stain.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And the sun came in the window.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It's this little bedroom that
my two sisters and I shared.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it touched right
where the blood was.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I had this sense
I was not alone.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go off
and go to museums,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.130 align:middle line:84%
when they were free,
on the free days,

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:90%
and looking and imagining.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, I was not alone.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of those
artists was there,

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.650 align:middle line:84%
letting me know there
were other realities.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
being a little girl.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I think, for all
of us, if we were

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.142 align:middle line:84%
to get still to see that even
in the deepest, darkest times--

00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and I know you've heard
this, and I can't quote

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:90%
who says this, but it's true--

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
the light is the brightest.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
my darkest times.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And healing was already
happening, saying,

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:90%
there is another day.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.290 align:middle line:90%
The sun is here.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.109 align:middle line:84%
You are part of
something bigger.

00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's difficult to do when
you're in the depths of that.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:90%
But it is possible.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:90%
So yes, things are happening.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And solutions are happening.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:90%
People are coming together.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it in a
way of standing for things--

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.630 align:middle line:84%
not against, not about
violence, but about change--

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:84%
not at all apologetic
about the change.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, that is
absolutely profound.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that story.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.049 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:42:58.049 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I could see the--

00:42:59.090 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, it's so--

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes!

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
You can still see it.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes-- of the sun.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's in me.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: That sunbeam
is forever with me.

00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've often turned
to the sun for healing.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.918 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Just imagine, if
the next day, you wake up

00:43:11.918 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
sun-- we all go mad.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah-- yeah.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: See?

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we wake up
every day and say, thank you.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Because it's here.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We just need to remind
ourselves and each other.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.379 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that brings
us to the fourth gift, which

00:43:24.379 --> 00:43:25.400 align:middle line:90%
is the gift of hope.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, well, hope
is a wonderful thing.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.704 align:middle line:84%
And right now, it's
being written about.

00:43:30.704 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
argued in saying,

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.203 align:middle line:90%
we don't really need hope.

00:43:33.203 --> 00:43:35.034 align:middle line:90%
That's just that paralysis.

00:43:35.034 --> 00:43:36.200 align:middle line:90%
You just sit there and hope.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.970 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not the hope.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
That's not the true hope that
the original instructions

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.190 align:middle line:84%
told the indigenous
elders around the world.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Hope in action--

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah!

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Hope is
an energy source.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Many of the things we've
created happened not because we

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:90%
could see it from our senses.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:90%
But we could imagine it.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:90%
We could intuit it.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Spirit whispered in our ear--

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever it was-- other.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's that hope.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have heard
that, that hope says

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that it's not happening or hope
is the absence of it occurring.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And so you're talking
about an energetic hope.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, and
it's a hope in action.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:90%
So it moves you.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:84%
You're compelled to
move with this hope.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:90%
See, I was compelled to move.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The hope came,
for me, in dreams,

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
in my dreams of a
little girl, of being--

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.566 align:middle line:84%
I knew, at age 3
and 4, I was already

00:44:36.566 --> 00:44:38.690 align:middle line:84%
dreaming that what I was
going to be when I grew up

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.079 align:middle line:84%
was connecting hearts
all over the world.

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that that was
going to be an organization

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.380 align:middle line:90%
development consultant.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.590 align:middle line:90%
But I knew that.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a pull already.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.380 align:middle line:90%
So by age 16, I'm in college.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And what am I doing?

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm already studying that.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you
give us an example

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.050 align:middle line:84%
of how we would find
hope in something?

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
In maybe an exercise
or somewhere

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can really practically
teach is how to get to hope?

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, and I think
a big one is dreaming.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And I hear a lot of
people-- well, first of all,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:84%
they don't give themselves
enough time to sleep.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:11.970 align:middle line:90%
So they don't dream.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.063 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: But you can
do waking dreams too.

00:45:14.063 --> 00:45:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think it's not
punishing the small child who

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.167 align:middle line:84%
wanders and in their
imagination that-- that's

00:45:19.167 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
an important process
that's happening.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting to
learn that in education too.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But dreaming-- so
I asked people--

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:84%
when I'm working with adults,
I say, before you go to bed,

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:84%
just give yourself a couple
minutes to just get present.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And then ask.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, your
inner wisdom--

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.820 align:middle line:84%
ask your inner guides, whatever
it is, from whatever belief

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.485 align:middle line:84%
system you have, to bring
forth whatever in dream-time.

00:45:45.485 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
activating our dreams,

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.990 align:middle line:90%
activating our imagination.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Cynicism, doubt--
the danger of doubt

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.040 align:middle line:84%
just stops so many
things from happening.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.157 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have
these computers.

00:45:57.157 --> 00:45:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have a lot of
the different technology

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.281 align:middle line:90%
we have, if people just--

00:46:00.281 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, that can't be.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.540 align:middle line:90%
They dreamed those.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is true.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we go through a couple
of practical exercises

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:90%
on each of the four gifts?

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.816 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just
gave us one on hope.

00:46:12.816 --> 00:46:15.546 align:middle line:84%
What about a practical
exercise on forgiveness--

00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:16.670 align:middle line:90%
forgiving the unforgivable.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Forgiving
the unforgivable--

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, on that one,
it is about listening--

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:84%
listening to yourself,
first and foremost.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Here's the truth
about all these gifts.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Spirit gave it to these
elders so that we could all

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.640 align:middle line:90%
remember that we're one.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, these
Four Gifts are intimately

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:90%
interconnected.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:90%
You could start wherever.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So for forgiveness,
forgiveness was

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:84%
starting to listen and be
able to start connecting up.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:90%
So I was listening.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:84%
First, I didn't trust human
beings-- the two-leggeds-- as

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:90%
much as I trusted nature.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was listening to the
trees, listening to the sun,

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.430 align:middle line:90%
just being present to it.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Go outside, if it's a bad work
day, and walk around the block.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So there is something that
you can do just immediately.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it begins that
process of forgiving.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think, it's very important
to say here, on forgiveness--

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.120 align:middle line:84%
part of what stopped
me from forgiving

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:84%
was I had the wrong
definition of forgiveness.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I thought forgiveness
meant you forget.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought forgiveness
meant I was weak.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought forgiveness
was meaning

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I was betraying my own
identity group, whether it

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.890 align:middle line:90%
was Hispanic--

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --or Native
American, or a woman.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.216 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or giving permission
for that wrongness to happen.

00:47:34.216 --> 00:47:35.284 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah-- no.

00:47:35.284 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness means you're
just freeing yourself

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.610 align:middle line:90%
up from being imprisoned.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And what it really means--

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --is that you
too can still seek justice.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.612 align:middle line:84%
You do right it,
so for yourself--

00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you for--

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --and for future.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --saying that-- yes.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: So that's
really important.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.930 align:middle line:90%
So there's a step to begin--

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.389 align:middle line:84%
so I think, just knowing
what that is and listening.

00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Forgiveness is
kind of the key that

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:90%
unlocks all of that.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's a huge--

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:90%
it's a huge path to freedom.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your voice, your
healing, your action--

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Being in
unity with other people--

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.050 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to be in total
unity if you're holding back.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, I did with my armor.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, I'll belong to this
group, but only a little bit.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm putting
the armor back up.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't--

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I
don't really trust you.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --want
to be hurt-- yeah.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because I don't-- yes.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And then
realize-- well, it's

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.970 align:middle line:90%
keeping out the good stuff too.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And you
don't want that.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm worth that.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.300 align:middle line:90%
You're worth that.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Every being is worthy of love.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.527 align:middle line:84%
And so that begins
that whole process.

00:48:26.527 --> 00:48:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.985 align:middle line:84%
I love how you call
us the two-leggeds.

00:48:28.985 --> 00:48:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah, we
are the two-leggeds.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great analogy.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.617 align:middle line:90%
A practical tip on unity--

00:48:34.617 --> 00:48:35.575 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, unity--

00:48:35.575 --> 00:48:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I think, meditation is
a good one on unity.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, people
think, well, you

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.955 align:middle line:84%
have to be in a crowd to
realize your connectivity.

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:45.950 align:middle line:90%
But just meditate.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, in that
space, you are so much more.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.220 align:middle line:84%
You connect your
head and your heart.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.072 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:48:53.072 --> 00:48:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I think, right now, people
need to connect their head

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and heart.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:84%
My uncle-- that same
uncle-- used to say--

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the things before he
told us the different wisdom,

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.880 align:middle line:84%
he'd say, often, the
toughest, but always

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.950 align:middle line:84%
the most rewarding
journey in life,

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.670 align:middle line:84%
is journey from the heart
to the head and back again

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.840 align:middle line:84%
or the head to the
heart and back again.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.130 align:middle line:90%
And he wished many journeys.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:14.300 align:middle line:90%
That's one to practice.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Get still.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.160 align:middle line:90%
What's happening in my heart?

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.370 align:middle line:90%
What's happening in my head?

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Connect them--

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Back to the heart.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Meditation-- Yes.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When I watch
the news, I do that.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I've seen these separations of
families at the borders now.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, it's really hard.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I could
feel into that.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But then I could also
send love to that--

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and realize that
they will be connected again.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And they are always connected.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are always connected to--
in a unity way-- even our lost

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:40.910 align:middle line:90%
loved ones.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, and
people are standing up.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I just was-- all these
governors who said,

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:84%
we're not sending down our
military or whatever you call--

in Seneca is thank you,

me of our connection
