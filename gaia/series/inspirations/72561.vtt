00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be great if you
could work out your brain

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:90%
like you work out your body?

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, why not?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Your brain can be exercised like
any other muscle in the body,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
but in the case
of neurofeedback,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
it's like training the
brain to balance itself

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and to self-regulate.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Neurofeedback is
a brain exercise,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
we're exploring today

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
with Doctor Siegfried Othmer.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
He's the chief
scientist at the EEG

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Institute in Woodland Hills.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Othmer has been involved
in the development of research

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
grade instrumentation for
EEG feedback since 1987.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing this
for quite a long time.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. SIEGFRIED OTHMER: Right.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me a
little bit about how

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
you got interested
in neurofeedback

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It was actually
through our son Brian.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And his problem, even though
he started out normally

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:84%
enough in life, became
worse at about age seven

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
when a seizure
disorder developed.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
not uncommon

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
that children develop seizures
first in that kind of age

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:90%
range-- six through eight.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there any
cause a reason for it, or--

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, we think it
relates back to birth injury.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But then it doesn't
actually show up until later.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.449 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the issue,
however, wasn't just seizures.

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Once the seizures had been
identified, that, of course,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:90%
became the focus.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of fact,
he had behavioral problems

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
all over the place, and he was a
very difficult child to manage.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And the neurologist was,
of course, just interested

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:90%
in the seizures.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But we had to live
with him, and we

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
realized the problems
were much bigger.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
He was thrown out of school
for behavioral issues.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:90%
He got into fights and so forth.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And this was very strange,
because he himself very greatly

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
disapproved of his own behavior.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he didn't
want to behave that way.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He didn't understand it.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't control it.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Didn't understand it.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
We didn't understand it.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:90%
He didn't understand it.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So very clearly,
his behavior was not

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:90%
implementing his intentions.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
behavior was brain based.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a
behavioral eruption,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
if you will, much like
the seizure itself.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we later-- years later--
found out about neurofeedback.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And that really made a
human being out of him.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you start to notice
the difference right away?

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Yes, within
a few sessions.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.247 align:middle line:84%
But being skeptical parents,
we didn't acknowledge-- my wife

00:02:52.247 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't acknowledge
to each other

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
that we were, in fact, seeing
changes until a month into it,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
someone else said,
Brian is different.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys doing something?

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I says yes, there's
this thing, neurofeedback,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
we're trying.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
other people--

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.909 align:middle line:90%
it was independent validation.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else had
noticed the change,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.635 align:middle line:90%
so it was OK to talk about.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So anything,
though, that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
could help improve the
quality of your lives

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
worth exploring.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.974 align:middle line:90%
So if you saw change happening--

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it was
worth diving into.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.397 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: That encouraged
us to continue.

00:03:25.397 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But that, of course,
was just the beginning.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The first month just
give us an inkling

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
of what, in fact, was
possible with him.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
was the EEG doing?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And what is EEG, for
people that don't know?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, the EEG is
just the electrical activity

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that
we happen to be

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
able to see when we put
the electrode on the scalp

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and kind of listen
in on the brain.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So it gives us, in a
sense, some visibility

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:90%
into the neuronal dance.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.805 align:middle line:84%
And the neuronal dance
reflects the good

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and the bad of what
the brain is doing.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So it can show us
the seizure activity

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and it can show us when
the brain is behaving well.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And we use that information,
then, to train the brain.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this the same
thing-- is neurofeedback

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:90%
the same as biofeedback?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yes and no.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Both neurofeedback and
biofeedback-- they both fall

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
into the same class of
self-regulation training.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Neurofeedback just
happens to be biofeedback

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:84%
using the EEG--
using brain waves.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%
There's a little fancier term--

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Neuro verses bio?

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.146 align:middle line:84%
What had happened
is biofeedback sort

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
of came along in the
'70s-- '60s and '70s.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:90%
And it became old hat.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And then along
came neurofeedback.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.332 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to bring
attention to this new thing,

00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
so we had to call
it something new,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:90%
so we called it neurofeedback.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.352 align:middle line:90%
It's really biofeedback.

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you keep
saying self-regulate,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
which I find a fascinating
term, because it

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
means that the brain starts
to become reliant upon itself

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and starts to control itself.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
How does the neurofeedback
teach it to do that?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Or did I get that right at all?

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Well, yes.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that the
brain is, of course,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
a self-regulating entity, right?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It controls our activities in
life-- it controls itself--

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
all by bootstrapping
its own capacities.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It has learned
everything it knows.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
the brain does,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
it does by virtue
of self-regulation.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It got there through
learning its own behavior.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing now
is the shortcomings of that.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So in case of our son
Brian, the seizure activity,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that's a failure of that
self-regulatory process.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The question is, can we then
restore self-regulation?

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Can we enhance the brain's
ability to control itself?

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes, we can.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So we think of the
brain as naturally

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.107 align:middle line:90%
a self-regulating system.

00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, though
it feels, though-- when

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you have something like
anxiety or depression

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
or even out of
control appetite, it

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.714 align:middle line:84%
feels like you're
so out of control

00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:07.005 align:middle line:84%
and that the brain isn't
self-regulating or controlling

00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And now we
understand all those problems

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
as failures in self-regulation--
that, indeed, there's not just

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the psychological perspective
of you're feeling anxious.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's the
feeling component,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
but if we look at the brain,
the brain is acting up.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And now that's directly
accessible to us

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%
through brain training.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
we give the brain

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:84%
information about its own
failures to regulate properly,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
it can get itself back into
a state of good regulation.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.144 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is similar
to what happened to me when

00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:46.935 align:middle line:84%
I had-- I had an
accident-- a bike accident

00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and I damaged a certain
part of my brain.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed-- I found
this out after-- unconscious

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
for 30 minutes and left
with the inability to speak,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
which I'm still working on.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to a
neurologist and found

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that there was the
prefrontal cortex of my brain

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that was not responding or
sending the signal back as

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.241 align:middle line:84%
fast as it-- as the
other parts of my brain.

00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.406 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:07:12.406 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it was about 20%
of what the rest of my brain

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%
was doing.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.209 align:middle line:84%
So the neurologist gave me the
diagnosis-- the determination.

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But the way that I
actually healed it

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:90%
was through neurofeedback.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain how the
neurofeedback re-stimulated

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.682 align:middle line:90%
or regrew that part of my brain?

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Let's use
the word reactivated.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So it brought--
the nerve feedback exercise

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
of just the brain seeing
itself in action brought

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
your frontal lobe back
into the conversation

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the way it was supposed to be.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So we can think of the
brain as almost, by analogy,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to a team where different team
members have different roles.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
every team member

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is actually a huge
platoon of neurons.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these platoons of
neurons having to coordinate.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's some precision
that needs to happen there--

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.469 align:middle line:84%
that if there's
slight mismatches,

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
then things aren't talking to
each other the way they should.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And so in the case
of head injury,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.975 align:middle line:84%
things are almost
working, but not quite.

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nuh-uh.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right?

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But it
doesn't take much.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It may feel like you've lost a
whole lot, as indeed you did,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
felt like you lost a whole
lot of your former abilities.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't take much in
the way of a realignment

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%
to bring those back.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
like the neurons

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:90%
are missing-- missing in action.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
they're not playing

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the team.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is incredibly
valuable information,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
because most people deal
with brain traumas and brain

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
injuries and think this is
their sentence for life.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And that you can actually
re-stimulate the team

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and those neurons to connect
and reconnect and rebuild

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
through neurofeedback
is life giving.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: This is where
medicine has been.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.804 align:middle line:84%
It's basically accepted the
brain malfunctions as a given.

00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And we nudge it a little
bit with medications.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.582 align:middle line:84%
And anything that medications
can't do, we say we can't do.

00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And now we say, no, no.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole other
avenue available to us

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of brain training-- of just
actually allowing the brain

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
to witness its own dance.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And that allows it to
re-coordinate the dance the way

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.914 align:middle line:90%
it should be.

00:09:34.914 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of your
patients-- what percentage would

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:90%
you say are children?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.429 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Oh, right
now in our office--

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
which is different from what
it used to be-- right now,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
it's about a third to
a half of children.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:90%
It used to be mostly children.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, we were dealing with
attention deficit disorder

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%
early on.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're dealing with a
whole raft of conditions,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing
a lot of adults.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, probably the
majority of adults.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%

And with regard to
attention deficit disorder,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.546 align:middle line:90%
medicine has not stood idle.

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The medications have
improved, and so forth--

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
medication strategies
have improved.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're not seeing
the child for whom

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
10 milligrams of Ritalin
solves the problem.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
That's not who we're seeing,
where the parent would just

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
like to get the
kid off of Ritalin.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Those parents exist,
but that's not

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:90%
what's coming into our practice.

There's a limited
category of things

where Ritalin might be the
answer for the children.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, much as I--
it is an answer,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not
the best answer.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But we're saying
for most children, it's not.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And for many children, even
where Ritalin is the answer,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not the best answer,
and they should still

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
be on the hunt for
something better.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is
an incredible solution,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
because this actually teaches
the brain to regulate itself,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.434 align:middle line:84%
rather than the medication
doing it for it, right? .

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So attention deficit disorder
is not the Ritalin deficiency

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a deficiency, however,
in self-regulatory capacity.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And now the issue is,
can we restore it?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.541 align:middle line:90%

This type of brain
exercise, I think,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
can really have
a profound effect

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.885 align:middle line:84%
What neurofeedback
basically is is

00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:44.746 align:middle line:84%
that it's a process whereby
a person is essentially

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
learning to exercise their
own brain wave activity.

is one in which

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
we show you what
your brain is doing.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And we typically show
you in terms of a game.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So a video-- audio/video
display that proceeds

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:84%
when your brain calms
down and does not

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
proceed when you're
not calming down.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So you are step by
step rewarded for going

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:90%
in a calming direction.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>The most rewarding
thing is just

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
seeing how happy
he is and also how

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
happy the rest of his family is.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible not
just what neurofeedback

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So that video was wonderful
to show us that we have--

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that there are solutions
in a wide spectrum

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
of emotional issues.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
What about adults-- adults
with severe depression,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
unexplained
anxiety-- those types

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
of-- where they've been
around for a long time?

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, in
those cases, the brain

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.375 align:middle line:84%
has had a longer time in order
to consolidate bad habits.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Train itself.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: In fact, this can
be seen as-- understood just

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
as the downside of
brain plasticity.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Neurofeedback takes advantage
of brain plasticity to heal,

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
but of course, it's
brain plasticity

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that got us in trouble
in the first place.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.067 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
brain having learned

00:17:59.067 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
"bad habits," if you will.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what the
plasticity is is the bundles--

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%
neural bundles that form there.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Learning
patterns of behavior

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that are not necessarily
functional for the person.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may originally have
had a perfectly sound trigger.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
There may, in the past, have
been reasons for the brain

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
to be anxious and so forth.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But then that
became consolidated,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
took on a life of its
own, and now the person

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
is stuck with it.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But we can still
train the person out

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
of that-- the depression and
the anxiety and so forth.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it can, in fact,
happen quite rapidly.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But it may not always
happen rapidly.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It may need to take more
time, because again,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that pattern has
been so consolidated.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when a trauma
happens or the pattern begins,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.232 align:middle line:84%
does the physical neurons
take place that form a memory?

00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Are they little bridges
or bundles in the brain?

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: The neurons
are like little pawns

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in a chess board or
little, let's say,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
soldiers in the platoon, all
essentially acting alike.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.687 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But they're involved
in different activities

00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
depending on where
they are the brain.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally, they all
do kind of the same thing.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They obey the same
rules and so forth.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.414 align:middle line:84%
And that's why our
technique works

00:19:22.414 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
with so many different
problems, because we're

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
dealing with neurons that
play by the same rules

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
wherever they are and whatever
function they're serving.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're concerned
with the group activity

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:84%
of these neurons--
the group behavior.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And that happens be
exactly what the EEG shows.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
It shows us when the neurons
are dancing together.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
If they're doing their
own thing-- rogue

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
neurons-- we don't see it.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But the neuronal dance
can get out of control

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and that's what a seizure is.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
The seizure is an
extreme example

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
of the neuronal dance
getting out of control.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.084 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:20:03.084 --> 00:20:05.249 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But short of that,
we see everything else,

00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
like the anxiety,
depression, and so forth.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
All of that can be seen modeled
in terms of deficiencies

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
in the regulation of this
global neuronal dance--

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
about 8 and 1/2 billion
parametel neurons

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:90%
in the cortex.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My god.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
You did a great job of
explaining something so complex

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and making it very
understandable.

Thank you.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
In the case of someone who's
a veteran-- a Vietnam vet

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or a war veteran--
who has experienced

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
severe shock, seen,
definitely visual trauma,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and auditory trauma, and
kinesthetic trauma-- that

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
registers into so many different
centers of the brain-- can

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
you-- and I
understand that you've

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
done a program with Dr.
Daniel Amen and PTSD patients.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.057 align:middle line:90%
How was that effective?

00:20:55.057 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, first of
all, the thing to realize

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is that, again, even though
the consequences of trauma

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
can be devastating-- just as
was the case with your head

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
injury-- we're not talking here
about neurons being destroyed.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They're, again,
merely dysfunctional.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And so once again, the
same remedy applies.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We need to recruit these
neuronal assemblies

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
into doing their
proper dance again.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, in trauma
disorders, the problem

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
has a certain character which
is that the brain is now

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:90%
expecting adverse events.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
It lives in the
trauma condition.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Even though the person may now
have come home from the war

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
zone and is now sitting
on the couch at home,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.835 align:middle line:84%
that brain is still living
under threat, if you will.

00:21:51.835 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So it
cannot calm down.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And whereas the rest
of us who happen

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
to be graced with
functional brains

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
live actually out of
very calm states-- that

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:84%
is the defining quality
of good brain function.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Calm states?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.037 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Being able to
operate out of calm states.

00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Operate outside of them?

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: No.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:90%
That you live in them.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And you
live in calm states.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And then do you
do what you must,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
but you immediately
return to calm states.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.395 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:22:27.395 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.259 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: You don't
live very well--

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
you're not very functional
in agitated states.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:33.085 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So you want to
operate out of calm states.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so our task for
the traumatized brain

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is to reacquaint the
brain with its calm states

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.705 align:middle line:90%
to which it has lost access.

00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And so then the cortisol
and the stress hormones

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:90%
are not releasing.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:90%
You're in a place--

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.148 align:middle line:84%
That'll all settle
down once we get

00:22:54.148 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the neurons dancing
their normal dance.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can this be
achieved through meditation?

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well,
there is our big hint

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:90%
of why this is so powerful.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who relate
to meditation because that's

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:84%
so familiar can think
about it in those terms.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is a way
of calming the brain.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And good things happen when
you're not doing anything.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
You're just sitting there
meditating and good things--

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.887 align:middle line:84%
we know good things
happen, right?

00:23:24.887 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.011 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So what
does that tell you?

00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
That tells you that
deactivating the brain

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually, for
certain people, the way

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to back to health-- back to
good mental function, right.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just that with meditation,
it's passive in a sense.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
You're giving your brain--
you're taking obstacles

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:90%
out the way.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And the brain may have the
opportunity to self-heal,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and it may take that
path, but it may not.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you can't
meditate when you're driving

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.765 align:middle line:84%
and when you're having
communication and conversation.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Well, certainly not.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But even if you give the
brain that opportunity,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.865 align:middle line:90%
it may not find its way.

00:23:58.865 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So with neurofeedback
now, it is an active process.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It guides
it into that, yes.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Because now--
my wife Sue Othmer, who's

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
our chief clinician, she calls
it meditation with handrails.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it
guides the process

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
by showing the brain--
essentially giving it

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.577 align:middle line:84%
a flashlight to guide
it through its darkness.

00:24:19.577 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a video here
that shows some of the SPECT

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:84%
scans that Dr. Othmer
did with Daniel Amen

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:90%
to-- with patients with PTSD.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.194 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:24:29.194 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>In connection with
our work with veterans,

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
we thought it would
be nice to get

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
some of the usual
kind of imagery

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that is now done
on brain function

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to document
the progress that we're

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
making with neurofeedback.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So in this connection, we're
working with Dr. Daniel Amen,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
who is known around the
world for this kind of work.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
He's looked at SPECT scans for a
variety of clinical conditions,

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:90%
including for PTSD.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when one of our veterans
was willing to do that,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:84%
we sent him down there
for some SPECT imagery,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:90%
down to Newport Beach.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And after the
neurofeedback, another set.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And we were just really
struck by the difference

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:90%
that we could see in the data.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were already
excited about the progress

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that he had been making
in the neurofeedback,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's ever so much better
to see it in real color--

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in living color.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:90%
This shows the SPECT imagery.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
SPECT stands for Single
Photon Emission Computerized

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Tomography.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it shows us elevations
in activity level

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
up here at the anterior
cingulate cortex,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
at the basal ganglia,
and at the thalamus,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and a whole lot of activity
back here at the cerebellum.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And this pattern--
this diamond pattern--

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is the characteristic
pattern that we or Dr. Amen

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
expect to see typically in the
case of post traumatic stress

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was before
the neurofeedback.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And here we're
seeing the same brain

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
after a number of
neurofeedback sessions.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, the
anterior cingulate cortex

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
has calmed down significantly.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
The basal ganglia
have calmed down.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:90%
The thalamus is still lively.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:90%
But look at the cerebellum.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It has just majorly
decreased in activity level.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And we read that as
being all to the good.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a calmer
brain that is more

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
able to control and
regulate its own activity.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
much the experience

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that this person
has in his life.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
He's just more in
charge of his life.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the experience
of neurofeedback for him

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.437 align:middle line:84%
has been nothing less
than transformational.

00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.228 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that,
because you really showed,

00:27:06.228 --> 00:27:09.372 align:middle line:84%
on the SPECT scan, the areas
that the brain changed.

00:27:09.372 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
You can see this.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've been
studying this and working

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
with this type of research
grade EEG for such a long time.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen that people
are-- that the technology has

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
improved in any way
or that it's more

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.720 align:middle line:84%
effective for one thing
rather than another?

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Oh,
indeed, the technique

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.347 align:middle line:90%
is still under development.

00:27:30.347 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it?

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.596 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:27:31.596 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have new software coming
out several times a year

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:90%
as new ideas are implemented.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're not the
only people who

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:90%
are innovating in this field.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So there are a variety of
neurofeedback techniques

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
emerging that have their
individual strengths.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, the strength

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of our particular
method is really

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:90%
in application to trauma.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
picture of mental health

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
in the large and just look at
the whole raft of issues that

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
afflict people that you
know, so much of that

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
is traceable to what
happened to these people

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
in early childhood.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Mental health
professionals know this.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they can't
do anything about it.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
They know it, but
what can you do?

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We now, you see, can
do something about it.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're reshaping
these neuronal networks,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
we're, in effect, reaching back
to the early childhood history.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:90%

regulatory functions that

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
are not really under
our conscious control.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%

consciousness.

with the chemicals

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
in the brain-- the
actual neurons?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, the
chemicals, of course--

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
you can talk
chemistry, you can talk

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
bio-electric function
and so forth.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:90%
They're inseparable.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.809 align:middle line:84%
We're talking-- we're
of course talking

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
about electrical function
in the brain when

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about neurons.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But what is the
bearer of electrical charge?

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:90%
It's chemicals.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:90%
It's ions.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.301 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: OK.

00:29:19.301 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can use whatever
language is convenient.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And for us, since we're
talking frequency and so forth

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and electrical transmission
between neurons

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- the
communication between neurons--

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
it's really more
convenient for us

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to talk in the electrical terms
rather than chemical terms.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.505 align:middle line:90%
But they're equally valid.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, the study that you
did with the veterans

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and the PTSD veterans
are-- it was a huge study.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.307 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have
a clip here of one

00:29:51.307 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
of the veterans talking
about it in his own words.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.074 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:29:55.074 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>15 years in the Marine Corps.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I had previously
enlisted-- crossed over,

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.575 align:middle line:84%
picked up a commission
after two years.

00:30:02.575 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I was Marine of the month,
Marine of the quarter,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
toured in Iraq three
times, twice in

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Fallujah, first time during
the Battle of Fallujah.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The last time, I was
up at a transition team

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:84%
up at the Port of Walid,
which borders Syria and Iraq.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I realized that what
I was looking for,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
as far as profession, the Marine
Corps offered a lot of it.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Coming back the
first time, it was

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.200 align:middle line:84%
just-- it seemed like
a lot of confusion.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if I was
pulled out from my life plan.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was kind of
like the jet lag at first.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like I
was just tired a lot,

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.920 align:middle line:84%
but it seemed to be a
lot more than normal.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
10 weeks later, they said
I was going out again.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
It was during the holidays
and it just really threw me

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:90%
for another loop.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.518 align:middle line:84%
Just the calling
my mom and letting

00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:54.142 align:middle line:84%
her know that I wasn't
going to make it

00:30:54.142 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
home didn't pan out
very well for me.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.249 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.249 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the
second time around,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.206 align:middle line:84%
I was just so depressed that
I didn't want to do anything.

00:31:05.206 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Every little decision
became a huge ordeal.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Coming back the third
time, the symptoms

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:90%
were definitely intensified.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I just felt more
lost, more unfocused.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And things were just a lot more
difficult to deal with-- hits

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.465 align:middle line:84%
you like a dark cloud just
smashed you in the face.

00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just horrible.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say I had
difficulty falling asleep,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.177 align:middle line:84%
but I had difficulty
staying asleep.

00:31:28.177 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like
I was constantly--

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:90%
every couple hours, I was awake.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.454 align:middle line:84%
After a while, it
came to a point

00:31:32.454 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
where OK, yeah, I'd have
coffee in the morning

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:90%
and then some in the afternoon.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Just staying awake and aware was
becoming the goal of the day.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>He seemed kind of down,
like he had depression.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't sure
what was going on.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.109 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
came back, he started

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
talking to me about
some of the supplements

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that he was taking,
like the SAM-e.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been on
antidepressants before.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>They gave me
Prozac or Welbutrin

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.081 align:middle line:90%
and several other ones.

00:32:00.081 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't even remember anymore.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't realize how
screwed up I was getting.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say I
was reckless, but I

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:84%
was some-- it just seemed
like I didn't care anymore.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I realized,
this isn't right.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
go see a counselor,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:90%
and they say, oh, yeah.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.212 align:middle line:90%
Well, you might have PTSD.

00:32:23.212 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized
there was something

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:29.136 align:middle line:84%
that I can do that may be
able to correct the situation.

00:32:29.136 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I was really excited when I
heard about neurofeedback.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
It was something new that
I'd never tried before.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to check it out--
see if that would work.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, it was more
like, what more could I lose?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
At Camp Pendelton over
at the Navy hospital,

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
they were offering it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of nice because it was
in the simple little office--

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
the couches, the desk,
and then the computers.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You got to sit in a nice,
relaxing chair, lean back,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and they put the little
electrodes on your head.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.355 align:middle line:84%
They have a video game
controller that you can use,

00:33:06.355 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Basically what it
is is you're sitting

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in front of a screen
that basically

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:90%
looks like a video game.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about it was

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
when they're programming in
the frequencies just felt

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:90%
a lot more relaxed.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd say probably about on
the fifth treatment or so,

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
some of the changes--

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:90%
initially, with driving.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I used to be
angry, aggressive.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I
started taking this,

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I noticed I wasn't doing that.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, he's able to
communicate a lot better.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Before, he would just kind of
withdraw and keep to himself.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.115 align:middle line:84%
But now he speaks up and
asserts himself more.

00:33:45.115 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel I'm more sociable
as far as my relationships.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to kind of build
a rapport a lot quicker

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.266 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:33:54.266 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Because beforehand,
I just seemed

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:84%
like I was in a cocoon--
didn't want to break out,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to talk to anybody.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I noticed I was
able to focus more.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
concentrate, sleep better.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I was able to understand what I
needed to do and how to do it.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
After neurofeedback,
I never had to take

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
any medications or
herbal supplements.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
>>And I've definitely
seen a difference, I mean,

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
compared to the herbal
medications and other things

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:90%
that he was trying.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It seems like this has
really made an impact.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I found neurofeedback
to be a positive experience,

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and I would definitely
recommend it to anyone.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.926 align:middle line:90%

wanted to show
what it looks like.

the clinician screen here,

we're showing what the
clinician is looking at,

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:84%
which is the EEG spectrum
from low frequency to high.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to get out of this
is to kind of get

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.805 align:middle line:84%
a sense of the
dynamics of the EEG--

00:35:46.805 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
how rapidly things are changing.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.885 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly adjusting.

00:35:50.885 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what's
causing this bright view

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and the entire screen
to change are electrodes

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.554 align:middle line:84%
that are hooked up--
just put on your head.

00:36:00.554 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing the
boundary-- the border

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:84%
of the image close in, which
is the signal to the brain.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:84%
That's where the information
is encoded from the EEG.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It's very low frequency
information, in this case,

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:19.597 align:middle line:84%
because that's what we're
keying in on in these-- well,

00:36:19.597 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:90%
in most of our work.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But principally in
these trauma cases,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
we're working at very
low EEG frequencies.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the information, very
slowly, but the brain still

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.860 align:middle line:90%
gets it.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the outline here
reflects that EEG amplitude.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.250 align:middle line:84%
This signal here is
actually the raw signal

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:90%
in the conventional EEG band.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And the practitioner's
looking at that

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that everything
is OK and as it should be.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't otherwise contain
very much useful information

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:90%
to the clinician.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
a feedback loop.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So if my brain is sending
a lower frequency,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
then the picture
starts to shrink.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But if it's sending a
more coherent frequency,

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
then the picture
starts to widen.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good way of saying it?

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: At this
low frequency, yes,

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
coherence is involved
and all of that

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to construct the EEG
that we're watching.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But actually, at this
very low frequency,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.350 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like watching
the swells of the ocean.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just the signal moves
up and down very slowly.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And here, the brain
cares about that signal

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.270 align:middle line:84%
because that signal
is so important

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:90%
to its own organization.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why it
matters to the brain.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so acutely
interested, even though we

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
as observers say
it's so slow, how

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
can the brain get
anything out of that?

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.006 align:middle line:84%
But it does because it's
the brain's own dance,

00:37:48.006 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the
brain is interested.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is the signal coming
from the computer to the brain,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.805 align:middle line:84%
or is it going from the
brain to the program?

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Or is it both?

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: It's both.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So the signal from the brain
is processed by the computer.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then by virtue
of the imagery,

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.860 align:middle line:84%
the information is also being
conveyed back to the brain.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's the feedback loop.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Feedback loop.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:16.616 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:38:16.616 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, the brain
operates that way

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:84%
with lots of internal
feedback loops,

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and we've just
added another one.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is a rewarding
screen right here, right--

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:84%
where the brain sees the
journey and the brightness

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and goes through the path
and the brain right now

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is receiving feedback of
a rewarding, pleasurable,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.454 align:middle line:90%
enjoyable frequency, right?

00:38:41.454 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:42.619 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then when it starts
to shrink, as it's doing now,

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and your view becomes narrow
and you can't see as much,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.600 align:middle line:90%
that's a non-rewarding--

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.384 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, a
slight iteration

00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:90%
on what you're saying.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.883 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:38:56.883 --> 00:38:58.904 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: In this very
low frequency training,

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
we no longer think in
terms of good and bad.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It simply is.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: This is simply
a modulating signal.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just like high
tides, low tide.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
One isn't better than
the other, right?

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
the same phenomenon.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at the ebb
and flow of brain activity

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:21.265 align:middle line:84%
and it's not easy to assign
goodness or badness to it.

00:39:21.265 --> 00:39:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.420 align:middle line:84%
If we do this with a
traumatized person,

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:84%
yes, there's dysregulation
stuck in there

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
somewhere-- reflected
in there somewhere.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know the good
part from the bad part.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It's all wrapped up together.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So the brain sorts it
out and basically works

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.324 align:middle line:84%
on that signal in
this feedback loop.

00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this
what dysregulation

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
would look like when it narrows
down and it stops traveling?

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: You're thinking
good and bad again.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.386 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:39:47.386 --> 00:39:51.274 align:middle line:84%
No, it just simply-- the signal
is low amplitude right now,

00:39:51.274 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and a few minutes
later, it'll be large.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.326 align:middle line:90%
And it simply is.

00:39:54.326 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But the signal is
guiding the brain's dance,

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's sort of informing
the brain-- the brain has

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:90%
this a-ha experience.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:90%
It says, oh, that's me.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.810 align:middle line:90%
That is my dance.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And so the brain
engages with that signal,

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
interacts with that
signal, and tries

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to control the signal,
because it realizes

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:84%
it's responsible
for that signal.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's the nature
of what this is about.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can think about
this in precise analogy

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to how we work with life itself,
so that when you pick up a rake

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.846 align:middle line:84%
to rake the leaves, your brain
assumes ownership of that rake.

00:40:37.846 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Or when you pick
up the tennis racquet,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
the brain immediately
forms a vision

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of where the sweet spot is.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can carry the
tennis racquet around

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.547 align:middle line:84%
and your brain is always
is carrying with it

00:40:52.547 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge of the sweet spot.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It just takes responsibility
for that, right?

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:56.914 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:56.914 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: That's just
the way the brain works.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain sees its own
dance, it does the same thing.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
It just takes control.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And that taking
control of that signal

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.707 align:middle line:84%
is the path back
to good regulation.

00:41:10.707 --> 00:41:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So now these programs are
pre-built with a specific ebb

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and flow and rhythms
to them, right?

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But are they
interactive, as well,

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:84%
where my brain would be
changing the screen at all?

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: In various ways, yes.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:90%
We have more complicated games.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There are sometimes
dozens of variables

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that are being altered in
the game as your EEG changes.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:39.803 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And you're
not even aware,

00:41:39.803 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
at the conscious level, of
all these things going on.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
But because the brain
knows it's doing it,

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:90%
it picks up on these things.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
You might ignore them
consciously-- in fact,

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
we distract people with
movies-- but there's

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.550 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of things going
on that the brain picks up

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:90%
because it's doing it.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it could be just
a scape of an ocean-- ebb

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and flow of an ocean.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:84%
We have a couple
of others in here,

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.670 align:middle line:84%
as well, that you can
show the example of.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in the case
of-- and it depends

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.450 align:middle line:84%
on what the person's
individual like is.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I resonated with butterflies
on my particular one.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:20.436 align:middle line:84%
This one is more of a space,
galaxy type of experience.

00:42:20.436 --> 00:42:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so there's
things moving in it.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me ask you as
we're watching this,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
how does this help with someone
where they have maybe sleep

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
issues or they're trying to
prevent themselves from waking

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:84%
up in the middle the night,
they have disrupted sleep,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
they have night sweats--
those types of things.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
How would something like this
regulate that in the brain?

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.495 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, it's
the same process.

00:42:49.495 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The quality of sleep is
actually a good indicator to us

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:90%
whether we're doing our job.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because at night,
the brain has the job

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:84%
entirely to itself of
carrying you through the night

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and giving you a
good night's sleep.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.260 align:middle line:84%
In the daytime, there
are things you can do.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You can have coffee
and so forth.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:90%
You can manipulate your state.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But at night,
the brain is on its own.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we can tell
whether we've done our job.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we have trained the brain
to self-regulate appropriately,

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.260 align:middle line:84%
the first signature
of that success

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:90%
will be a good night's sleep.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So we almost
always ask about

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:38.770 align:middle line:84%
sleep because it's such a
critical indicator to us

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.630 align:middle line:84%
of where the brain
is going wrong.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you have trouble
going to sleep?

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you have trouble
with frequent waking

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and then have trouble
going back to sleep?

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you wake up too
early and then--

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:55.260 align:middle line:84%
all these sorts of
things matter to tell us

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
exactly how that brain
needs to be trained.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about nightmares?

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.395 align:middle line:84%
Can EEG help with
something like nightmares?

00:44:02.395 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's another instance
of the brain really going out

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.210 align:middle line:90%
of control.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out
nightmares are exquisitely

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:90%
sensitive to this training.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So we can basically
categorically say

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that if a person has nightmares,
we haven't done our job yet.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we should
get rid of nightmares.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So very high
success rate for nightmares.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, with veterans, it's
a little bit different.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We talk about night
terrors there.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, not night terrors--
nocturnal flashbacks.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: I misspoke.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Nocturnal flashbacks.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And they need to be
distinguished from nightmares.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's both issues
involved with veterans.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And the nocturnal
flashbacks are a little bit

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:84%
like the daytime flashbacks,
but they occur at night.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The nightmares are
another phenomenon.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we
can deal with both.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.560 align:middle line:84%
What about pain, when
there's pain that's

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:84%
caused from a specific, maybe,
injury-- area in the back

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is inflamed or a
disk is bulging?

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Can this actually help
with the response?

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.800 align:middle line:90%
How does it work with pain?

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It's interesting
because in the case

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of chronic pain, we
are often dealing

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:90%
with a true physical loss.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: --a true
neuronal loss.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Here, we've really
who lost something.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the spinal column, there
could be the actual destruction

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:90%
of tiny little interneurons.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves us with
a limited capability

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:90%
of doing anything about it.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.610 align:middle line:90%
So what is left to us?

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:84%
What's left to us is the
judgment that the brain makes

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:90%
about that pain--

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:50.111 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: --which it's
still in charge of, right?

00:45:50.111 --> 00:45:51.947 align:middle line:84%
The messages are coming
up and saying pain.

00:45:51.947 --> 00:45:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.904 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But the
brain can still

00:45:53.904 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:84%
choose how to alert you
to that state of pain.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.520 align:middle line:90%
That's still modulatable.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that central
mechanism of pain regulation

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.150 align:middle line:90%
is still available to us.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can help with chronic pain
even in the most extreme cases.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.457 align:middle line:84%
Now, how far we can go with
that, that's a broad spectrum.

00:46:17.457 --> 00:46:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.710 align:middle line:84%
You need to be safe because
if it's a major source of pain

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.741 align:middle line:84%
because something is
severely injured, then

00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to cut the
signal off completely,

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.600 align:middle line:84%
because the body's trying
to tell the brain something,

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: The signal is
always still coming up.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.504 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: The question is--

00:46:34.504 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: The question
is, what assignment

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.760 align:middle line:90%
does the brain give to it?

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.189 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:46:39.189 --> 00:46:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We haven't actually
gotten rid of the pain.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The pain signal is coming
up loud and clear, right?

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:43.762 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:43.762 --> 00:46:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It's just, how
does the brain deal with it?

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you might
say in that sense

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:84%
we haven't dealt
with the pain at all.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:84%
What we have dealt
with is your sense

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of pain-- your sense
of victimization--

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that we've given
you-- hopefully,

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.330 align:middle line:84%
if we succeed--
mastery over the pain.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.441 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: The pain still exists.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And so
if you inquire, it

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
says yes, my foot still
hurts or my back still

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.510 align:middle line:84%
hurts or whatever, but
it doesn't bother me.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.247 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind
has-- now the brain--

00:47:17.247 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: The mind
brain-- the brain mind

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.290 align:middle line:90%
has risen above that pain.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So that is our hope
with chronic pain.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not to expunge it,
because that, indeed,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.989 align:middle line:90%
is not possible for us.

00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes
we get rid of pain,

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.450 align:middle line:84%
but in these extreme
cases of chronic pain,

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:90%
no, we don't get rid of it.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But mastery of the pain,
it may still be possible.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What I discovered
through the brain trauma

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that I had was it took me about
20 sessions to get my brain

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to feed back the
correct signal strength

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the brain was.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So how long would
it take someone,

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.830 align:middle line:90%
and does it last permanently?

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:59.950 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I needed to go
back every year or two just

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to check to see-- as you
would any type of check up--

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.690 align:middle line:84%
if the signal is still
responding accurately.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Does this last?

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, with
some chronic pain cases,

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.970 align:middle line:84%
we find that they actually
need to take the equipment home

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.680 align:middle line:90%
and train every once in a while.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.425 align:middle line:84%
Some people with
chronic pain who

00:48:16.425 --> 00:48:19.100 align:middle line:84%
have real sleep issues,
which is common,

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:90%
they may train every day.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's worth it, right?

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:23.304 --> 00:48:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: If a
half hour session--

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The
alternative is-- yeah.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.446 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: --with the machine
can give you a night's sleep,

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to pay that
price rather than staring

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:84%
at the ceiling in
pain all night, right?

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And so we have
had people who've basically

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
been on a daily diet
of neurofeedback

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:90%
just to manage their pain.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And they get hours of
pain free existence.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So we see phenomena all across
the map with chronic pain.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about with--
in the case of addictions

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.599 align:middle line:84%
where those tend to take
over or control the mind?

00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Does this help with addictions?

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: This is a huge story.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.006 align:middle line:84%
The addiction must be seen
as a brain based problem.

00:49:00.006 --> 00:49:01.880 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't start as
a brain based problem,

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.285 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a brain
based problem.

00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:04.169 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:49:04.169 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And so it needs
a brain based remedy.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever else is needed, it
also needs a brain based remedy.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And we do wonderfully
with addictions.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, we need to
train the brain out

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of that state of
dependency on the drug.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we succeed
is illustrated by the fact

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that many people actually
even lose their craving.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the past, in
conventional treatments,

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:31.290 align:middle line:84%
success constitutes just
being able to stay sober

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and whatever-- not use.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask the person
would they prefer to use,

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.530 align:middle line:90%
the answer is yes, right?

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It's not like we've
overcome the addiction in that

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.120 align:middle line:90%
sense--

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.441 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: --by and large.

00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's just that we've
given them the strength

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:90%
to live a different life.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, that's a
success in a way.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But how much better
if we actually

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.540 align:middle line:84%
get the person to the
point where he can say--

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: --no, I
don't need the drug.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.174 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: In fact, the drug
is no longer part of my life.

00:49:59.174 --> 00:50:01.037 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It no longer
has power over me.

00:50:01.037 --> 00:50:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: No longer
has power over me.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And you see, when the
brain wants the drug,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.040 align:middle line:90%
that's very hard to resist.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
chemical firing that--

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: And the brain
will have its way.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.777 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to--

00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:14.985 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Willpower
is overrated.

00:50:14.985 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:84%
If willpower is all you've
got, then be my guest.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Rely on it.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's not all we've got.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:90%
We can train the brain.

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why they say
willpower doesn't often work.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.296 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:50:25.296 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it is powerful
will, in the wrong direction

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:29.800 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.341 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, and
if we tell people

00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that they must depend on
willpower and then they fail,

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:84%
then we've also given
them a sense of failure.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It says no, we need to give
people every opportunity

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to succeed, and that
means brain training.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.021 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
could also have to do

00:50:43.021 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
with food addictions
and weight loss,

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:84%
essentially, because
you stop the addiction

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.167 align:middle line:90%
for certain foods or bad foods?

00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:51.000 align:middle line:90%
How would that work?

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.625 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:50:51.625 --> 00:50:55.730 align:middle line:84%
So appetite regulation is a
big part of the food issue--

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:84%
just basically getting to
the point of just regulating

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.310 align:middle line:90%
your appetite.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we have people, they
go to restaurant and say,

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't feel
like ordering dessert.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:08.710 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Who is the person who
drove by the bakery

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:84%
today without
stopping for donuts?

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Who is the person that
passed up on desert?

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:19.264 align:middle line:90%
They don't recognize themselves.

00:51:19.264 --> 00:51:20.929 align:middle line:84%
Their brain is now
in a different place.

00:51:20.929 --> 00:51:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.697 align:middle line:84%
Although they still
observe, they don't crave.

00:51:23.697 --> 00:51:24.571 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: No, no, no.

00:51:24.571 --> 00:51:25.626 align:middle line:90%
It's not by willpower.

00:51:25.626 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's their brain is now
in a different place.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Their brain has
now appropriately

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.340 align:middle line:90%
regulated appetite.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And now these things
become non issues.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.310 align:middle line:84%
The cravings disappear
and so forth.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The signals go
into a different direction?

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So those patterns or
those bundles actually break up

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.534 align:middle line:84%
and new habits and
patterns and bundles form?

00:51:43.534 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Right.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And since we're talking
about new habits,

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.260 align:middle line:84%
yes, it may take awhile to get
those new habits consolidated.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.715 align:middle line:84%
So you may see a quick impact
such as not wanting desert--

00:51:55.715 --> 00:51:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in the beginning?

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: --in the beginning.

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: But to
consolidate that and make

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.767 align:middle line:84%
that a new habit, it's
still going to take a while.

00:52:01.767 --> 00:52:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And lasting.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:02.920 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.544 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:52:03.544 --> 00:52:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now once again
about the program,

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:84%
the computer or--
say the technician

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.480 align:middle line:84%
wants to help someone with
this appetite control.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So can you enter that type
of program into the computer?

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Is that how that works from
the practitioner's perspective?

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.769 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious.

00:52:22.769 --> 00:52:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Well, OK.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Here, the brain is
in our favorite.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The brain functions as
an integrated whole.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing just how
intricately everything

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.460 align:middle line:90%
is intertwined.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out we have
a very basic approach

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that if your
problem is appetite,

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:90%
it's going to help that.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And if your problem
is addiction,

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.030 align:middle line:90%
it's going to help that.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally,
it's one approach.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: So what happens is
there is individualization

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.524 align:middle line:84%
of the training, but
it depends on how

00:52:51.524 --> 00:52:52.690 align:middle line:90%
you respond to the training.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the training
will differentiate

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in these different ways,
but it'll differentiate not

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:84%
according to whether you have
migraines or night terrors

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.780 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:84%
It'll differentiate according
to who you are as a person.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it will go according to
the character of your brain,

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:84%
not just depending
on what is failing.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's that kind of
individualization.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So this becomes very
personalized training.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little
bit about migraines.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:90%
You just mentioned migraines.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.872 align:middle line:90%
Could this help with migraines?

00:53:26.872 --> 00:53:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Very much so.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I were to list the
conditions in-- rank ordered

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.400 align:middle line:84%
according to how
well we do with them,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:84%
migraines would be
just about at the top.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And people really need to know
this because a lot of people

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:45.980 align:middle line:84%
are sort of content to live with
a certain level of migraines

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
in their lives and
they accept that.

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, as horrible
as migraines are,

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I would not find
that acceptable.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.860 align:middle line:84%
These people need to know
that there's an alternative.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.561 align:middle line:84%
And now, we tend to see the more
difficult end of the spectrum--

00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:59.685 align:middle line:84%
people who have spent 10
to 30 years with migraines

00:53:59.685 --> 00:54:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're just tired
of it and whatever

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're happy
to find this remedy.

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we know we
can succeed even

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:84%
with the most intractable
cases of migraine, which

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
means the easier
part of the spectrum

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:16.917 align:middle line:90%
should be easier to deal with.

00:54:16.917 --> 00:54:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: We even had
a case of a person who

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:84%
had a multi-decadal year
history of migraines.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.625 align:middle line:84%
And from the first session on,
never had another migraine.

00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:29.666 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you how long it

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.171 align:middle line:90%
takes for that to be effective.

00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Well, it
made a difference

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.753 align:middle line:90%
from the first session on.

00:54:33.753 --> 00:54:35.290 align:middle line:84%

needed 40 sessions

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.090 align:middle line:90%
to consolidate the training.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:37.636 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:54:37.636 --> 00:54:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

It's not like, OK, one

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: She still
had 40 sessions.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:46.577 align:middle line:84%
But never in that time did
she have another migraine.

00:54:46.577 --> 00:54:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So what does something
like this cost?

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Does insurance cover it?

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.420 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: Insurance is
getting-- is getting better,

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.440 align:middle line:84%
but insurance is
oriented towards saying

00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.890 align:middle line:90%
no, and so forth.

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to take a
while before the insurance

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
realizes that we really
solve people's problems

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's really cost effective.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more cost effective
to solve people's problems

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.400 align:middle line:90%
than to keep saying no.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is
in the course of life,

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.610 align:middle line:84%
with what we call dysregulation,
what we're dealing with here

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:20.960 align:middle line:90%
just gets worse.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, you're dealing
with serious medical issues.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you had taken care
of the problem of dysregulation

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.510 align:middle line:90%
when it was manageable--

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, I see.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: --then the
entire trajectory

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.740 align:middle line:84%
in life-- across life, this
lifespan would've been better.

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.615 align:middle line:90%
So I don't--

00:55:37.615 --> 00:55:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can still
affect it if it's

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.448 align:middle line:84%
in a chronic stage-- you
can still make a difference?

00:55:41.448 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And are
there measures being

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.210 align:middle line:84%
made towards getting the
insurance companies more

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:90%
onboarded?

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do cover it
under mental health, right?

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: We've not made
insurance companies a priority.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
time is coming when

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.890 align:middle line:84%
they should be brought
into the picture.

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they've taken,
historically, such an

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.910 align:middle line:90%
anti position.

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
times are changing.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And the time is coming
when-- it has happened

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.020 align:middle line:84%
which insurance companies
and hospitals and so

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.547 align:middle line:90%
forth are approaching us.

00:56:14.547 --> 00:56:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:15.980 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yeah.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:16.380 align:middle line:90%
That's good news.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very helpful.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a new book
out called "Brian's Legacy."

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is the story
of your son, yes?

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: This is the story
of our son's struggles

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:26.430 align:middle line:90%
with his epilepsy.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's remarkable in the
sense that most of the book

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is actually his story
in his own words.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.294 align:middle line:90%
It's his own journal.

00:56:33.294 --> 00:56:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It's his college
years in which he describes

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.610 align:middle line:84%
how he relates to
his own conditions--

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.910 align:middle line:84%
his own increasing
mastery of his condition.

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, ultimately, we lost him
in his senior year of college.

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, we never finally
got the seizures under control,

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:84%
despite the medications,
despite the neurofeedback.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:84%
He was still
wrestling with that.

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But as a person, he
really developed,

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and that was mainly
with the neurofeedback.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that story
is-- so I would--

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So his quality
of life was better?

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.964 align:middle line:84%
It really made a
human being out of him

00:57:08.964 --> 00:57:12.577 align:middle line:84%
to where he could
make friends and was

00:57:12.577 --> 00:57:13.910 align:middle line:90%
great to live with and so forth.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But the book, I think, is to
be particularly recommended

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:24.242 align:middle line:84%
to parents who are dealing
with their own problem children

00:57:24.242 --> 00:57:27.750 align:middle line:84%
or who've had their own
difficulties growing up,

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of this kind.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just to talk about
the solution oriented approach

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.367 align:middle line:90%
to EEG.

00:57:34.367 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OTHMER: Yes.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And now it looks like-- we call
it "Brian's Legacy" because we

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.880 align:middle line:84%
feel like Brian got
us into the field.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And now it looks like
we're heading to the point

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:51.050 align:middle line:84%
where the self-regulation
technologies will play--

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.980 align:middle line:84%
in the future-- play a major
role in bending the cost

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:84%
curve of medicine,
and also just simply

00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.950 align:middle line:90%
improving the quality of life.

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:02.500 align:middle line:84%
There's so much suffering in
the world which is unnecessary.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:02.702 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:58:02.702 --> 00:58:03.202 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:03.202 --> 00:58:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've talked
about everything

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.250 align:middle line:84%
from the ADD, ADHD
to appetite control.

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even touched on
peak performance and memory

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and focus, because it also
helps with that, as well.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.710 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things
that EEG and neurofeedback

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:18.300 align:middle line:90%
can help with.

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad
that you're here

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:22.120 align:middle line:84%
to explain it, to
demonstrate it,

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to show us how
the program works,

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and to show that it's such a
solution for so many things.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So thanks for exposing
us to this world.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OTHMER: It's
wonderful to be here.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great to have you here.

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:35.130 align:middle line:84%
