00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaia Inspirations.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And our topic for this series,
taped at the Celebrate Your

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Life Conference here
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
is to explore the
"I am" meaning.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And so far, the
meaning of "I am"

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.212 align:middle line:84%
is very individual
for each person.

00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And joining me
today is someone who

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:84%
understands how our individual
minds work, Joan Borysenko.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
She is a world-renowned expert
in the mind-body connection.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:84%
She's a licensed
psychologist with a doctorate

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
in cell biology from
Harvard Medical School.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And she bridges cutting-edge
science with deep humanity.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
So great to have you here.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with me.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOAN BORYSENKO: You're
so very welcome, Lisa.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I was telling
you this "I am" meaning

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
has taken on a life of its own.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It walks into the room
and takes a presence.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.822 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much experience you

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:90%
have with the "I am" meaning.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:84%
But what is true
for you right now?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
What "I am" statement
could you say?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well, I could say
I am part of the larger "I am,"

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that my whole being lives in
that unified field for which we

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:90%
have so many names.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was what we call
God who said to Moses,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:90%
"I am that I am."

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, I think,
it's a great statement

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
because we can't personify it.
"I am that I am" is remarkable.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It gets us
into present time.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I noticed as you were talking,
it just sinks the moment right

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:90%
into present time.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I feel really
present with you when

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.522 align:middle line:90%
you were talking about that.

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's great about
the sense of "I am that I am"

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is for me, it also means
I'm not what I'm not.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry about
who I think I should be,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that who I am is just right
at this point in time.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I was talking
about the mind-body connection.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And what we just did is we
just synchronized our minds,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
our body with this present
moment in the "I am."

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And you've explored the
mind-body connection

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
for so long, which
I absolutely love.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So many years ago, we were
convinced that the mind

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:90%
was separate from the body.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have done an
amazing job in helping us

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:90%
understand that it is together.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
We are one with our
minds and our bodies.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
you've discovered over the years
and what that means to you,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
being connected with
your mind and your body?

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well, first
of all, the word "mind"

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
has not been well-defined.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And in recent years, there's
a whole new field called

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:90%
"interpersonal neurobiology."

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's been
really popularized

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
by this wonderful neuroscientist
and physician from UCLA.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
His name is Dan Siegel.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
He got a large group of
people from all disciplines

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
together to actually
define what the mind is.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we say "mind" all
the time, and nobody knows,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:90%
what on earth is the mind?

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: And they came
up with a really amazing

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
definition, that
the mind is really

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
what carries information and
communication across time,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and that it's both
embodied in us--

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'll talk in
a moment about how

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the mind is embodied throughout
all of our cells and organs.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's also embedded
in our environment.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, Lisa,
you and I are talking.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And now our mind has made
informational communication.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I say registers
in you, doesn't it.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
If I say something scary,
you'd feel anxiety.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
If I say something funny,
you would have laughter.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And you would be making,
at a molecular level,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:90%
different hormones.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Empathy.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Empathy.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Dan Siegel, in
fact, founded something

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:90%
called the Mindsight Institute.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And mindsight is not only
the ability to witness

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in your
own body-mind system

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
but to actually tune in
empathetically what's

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:90%
going on with another person.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to a
very beautiful form

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of compassionate communication.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the mind
is located, of course,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:90%
outside the brain, right?

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.054 align:middle line:90%
It's located all around us.

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: It's all
around throughout the body.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is that
there's a unified field

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence to which we're
all hooking in, a larger mind.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So extends
outside of our body--

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --into the universe.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.324 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Exactly.

00:04:56.324 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fair
amount of experimentation

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:90%
that shows that's possible.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
remember the physician

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Larry Dossey's work talked about
the three eras of medicine.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The first era, or period
of time, of medicine

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
being entirely physical.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The second era really looking
at the mind-body connection.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And the third looking at
this unified quantum field

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
so that, while I know that
my mind affects my body,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Larry's Era III is the same
as interpersonal neurobiology

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
because it says your mind
affects my body and not only

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
as we sit here
but at a distance.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean that
distant healing and prayer

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
have an effect extending
beyond our body.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is
amazing because you

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
started talking about
this 20, 30 years ago

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and did studies at
Duke University then.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're just starting to get
this into our culture, which

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:90%
is-- it's brilliant.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned-- so let's
talk about the mind traveling

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.112 align:middle line:90%
through the body--

00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --on a molecular level.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: I think
one of the pioneers

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
in that was my very dear
friend, the late Candace Pert.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And she was the co-discoverer
of the receptors in our brain

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
for endorphins, that we
make our own endogenous--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that means "made within
us"-- endorphins.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why opiates
work, because we

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
have an opiate system.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And she discovered, in
general, that every time we

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
have an emotion, it
releases what she

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:90%
called "molecules of emotion."

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And these little molecules
are tiny little neuropeptides.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:84%
They go through the
blood-brain barrier.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And they bind to receptor
sites on all of our cells

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
like a lock and key.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have a thought,
you have an emotion,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and literally milliseconds
later, your cells all

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
get the message.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
When the lock and the
key come together,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
you have a chemical change
in the nucleus of your cells.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
your genes are either--

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
certain genes,
activated or repressed.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's an amazing thing.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So your whole body changes
due to your emotions.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a field now
called epigenetics.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And we know your DNA does
not just regulate your life.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It itself is regulated
by environmental effects.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
we're talking about

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is the environmental effect of
your own emotions on your DNA.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your own thoughts can
turn on, turn off those genes.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's so vitally important
what our thoughts are.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And as Dr. Bruce Lipton
says, our perception

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:90%
of those thoughts.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:90%
That's another level.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I so appreciate that.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
that we can turn on

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and turn off things like
metabolism with our thoughts?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.922 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: That's a
really interesting question.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:11.338 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was
thinking about this.

00:08:11.338 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to know.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Because
I'm a scientist,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
of course I would
say we would have

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to do an experiment about that.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that what you
eat, the food that you eat,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
definitely changes
your genetics.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous
epigenetic effect of food.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
So that will definitely help
to regulate your metabolism.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your latest work
is about the PlantPlus Diet

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
Solution.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.724 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
one-size-fits-all diet.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: No.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a vegan
solution unless you

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%
happen to be a vegan.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But in a nutshell,
what happened was

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that my beloved
husband found out

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
he had calcium in his arteries.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, uh-oh,
plaque in the arteries,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
but I know what to do
about that, so I thought.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Because there had
been some research

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that a very low-fat diet,
ultra low-fat vegan diet,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:90%
could reverse that.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So we went on an ultra
low-fat vegan diet.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And like so many
people on a diet,

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
we were like religious
fundamentalists.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Everybody should eat this diet.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It'll be so good for you.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:90%
You'll lose weight.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
All these good
things will happen.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's good for the planet.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It's-- you know.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And a year later, his blood
lipids had gone south.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
They were much worse
than they were before.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And we both gained
about 10 pounds.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what
is wrong with this,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
because that diet probably saved
the life of President Clinton.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: And it works
very well for many people.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
But it did not work for us.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So I started to scratch my head.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm
trained as a scientist,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, let me go to
the nutrition research, which

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I did for three years.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you, it's the
worst research in the world.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:90%
You cannot trust it.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of the studies are
what we call retrospective.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.605 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying, OK,
Lisa, change your diet,

00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and for 30 years we'll watch
your diet versus someone

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
else's-- that's too
difficult to do, generally.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So they do things like ask
people what they've eaten

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and then make correlations.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can say something
may be correlated,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
but you can't say that one
thing causes the other.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because every
body is different.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Not only
is every body different,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's like saying,
every time you see a fire,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
there are firemen there,
and coming to the conclusion

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:90%
that firemen cause fires.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's completely erroneous.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
A correlation does not
imply actual causation.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it, and I
said, I cannot believe that

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
the government has made
dietary recommendations.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at studies,
I found almost no good ones.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to look
through things, I thought,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the American diet
has gone so far

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
toward refined foods,
particularly refined carbs.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Turns out if you
eat a lot of carbs,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
whether they're refined or
whether they're whole grains

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that are ground up,
which is still refined,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
many people cannot deal with
that amount of carbohydrate.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is carbs
eventually turn into fat,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we got fat, and
that's why my husband's blood

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:90%
fat was rising.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
genetically different.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, most people can
eat all the fat they want.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.767 align:middle line:84%
It does not turn
into cholesterol.

00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: But others
can't do that because they

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
have multiple copies
of a gene called APOE4.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, most
people in this country

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:90%
are carb-resistant.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we have, in
part-- there are many reasons--

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
but in part, why there's an
obesity epidemic and why--

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does
carb-resistant mean?

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well,
that really means

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can't eat many
carbs because they just

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.186 align:middle line:90%
turn into fat.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They don't absorb--

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: They
don't metabolize them

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:90%
in the same way as other people.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They don't turn
into energy in the body?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.163 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: They
do turn into energy,

00:12:41.163 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
but you only need
so much energy.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And the rest will turn into fat.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.616 align:middle line:90%
But here's the problem.

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
If you eat too
many carbs, insulin

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
can't get into your
cells fast enough,

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with
high blood sugar.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And that accumulates
into a product

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:84%
called advanced glycation end
products-- glycation, glucose.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's a metabolic sludge.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to
get it out of the body.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We have no natural mechanism to
relieve us of these molecules.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And they can eventually
lead to heart failure

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and to inflammation and
to a variety of problems.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what we know is different
people need different diets.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people would do great
on a high carb vegan diet.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Other people, like me,
will grow sick on it.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a great video where Joan
talks about health statistics

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:90%
in our world and glycation.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.075 align:middle line:84%
>>Sponsored by
Quantum University.

00:13:57.075 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Hi, everybody.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm Joan Borysenko.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled to
be here to tell you

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
about some of the latest
developments in the field

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of integrative medicine.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Here's where the statistics
have taken us thus far.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
In 1960, the United States
was 16th in life expectancy

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
worldwide compared to
191 other countries.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we're 51st in
life expectancy

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
behind Bosnia and Herzegovina,
barely nosing out Guam.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this explains why the
average child born in 2014

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is expected to live a
greatly shortened life span,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
less than their parents,
69 years on average.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
At the other end
of the spectrum,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
our elders are already
losing their mind

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to an epidemic of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And kids, by the
way-- one in 68 now

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere on the
autism spectrum.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
That, it turns out,
is expected to relate

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to diet and particularly
the kind of gut bacteria

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that the highly processed
carb-rich American

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
diet gives us.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Something is happening that's
putting our brains at risk.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
that's putting the rest of us

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
at risk, a diet at
starves our good bacteria,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that has too many carbs
for us to process,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that's deficient
in micronutrients.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The US spends over $2.7
trillion a year on health care.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
That's nearly 19% of our GDP,
more than any other country

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And even if no other
aspect of our spending

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
increases in the next 20
years, the cost of health care

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:84%
alone will bankrupt
us as a country.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a shame,
considering the problems

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
we have with infant
mortality, maternal mortality,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and chronic illness
of every sort.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's get down to some
of the science bites now.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, three cheers for
nutritional literacy.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It sure isn't taught
in medical school.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not taught in
graduate school.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And most of us do not
know which end is up.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Why is the standard
American diet killing us?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Number one-- oxidative
stress, free radicals,

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
which are reactive
oxygen species that

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
run through the body stealing
electrons and denaturing

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
proteins and things.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
These are produced by
pesticides, herbicides.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:84%
That's important because
pesticides and herbicides

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:90%
are everywhere.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're destroying us.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
The second pillar of dietary
doom is inflammation.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You read about that everywhere.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that inflammation
is the final common pathway

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
in every single chronic disease,
as well as most cancers.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
The third pillar of
dietary doom is glycation.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
And that's when that sugar
binds to proteins in the body,

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and it forms a nasty
metabolic sludge

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
that we have no way
of getting rid of.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The fourth pillar
of dietary doom

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:90%
is micronutrient insufficiency.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't get enough of
certain vital nutrients,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
whether they're minerals like
magnesium or various vitamins.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The fifth pillar of dietary
doom is called dysbiosis.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
We are a microbial ecosystem,
as we'll discuss shortly,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and if you've got
the wrong bacteria,

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:84%
whether they're the ones
swimming in your eyeballs,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.674 align:middle line:84%
coating the surface
of your skin,

00:17:57.674 --> 00:18:03.687 align:middle line:84%
or residing in your digestive
tract, that can cause obesity.

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It can cause mood disorders.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It can cause a variety
of different problems.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's the elephant in
the room of mental health

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.436 align:middle line:90%
and physical health.

00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:17.364 align:middle line:90%
So let's learn more.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:20.738 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:20.738 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We just
learned a little bit

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
about the glycation process.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is eating an
enormous amount of carbs,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that the nutrients
cannot get through the carbs

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:90%
to get into the cells.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: No.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.699 align:middle line:90%
That's not quite right.

00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:42.948 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let me try that again.

00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: What I'm saying
is they develop too much sugar

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:90%
in the bloodstream.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
The point of insulin is to
take sugar out of the blood

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and into the cells where
either it's for energy

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
or it's stored as
a chain of sugars,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:90%
which is called a starch.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And the starch that
we store in our cells

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
for later use is
called glycogen.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happens-- let's
look at a marathon runner.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't have that much
glycogen stored in your cell.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So at about the 20th
mile of a marathon,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
a runner will run out of
energy because they've used up

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:90%
all their glycogen stores.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Then they have to start
burning fat for energy, which

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
takes longer, and
that's why it's

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
so difficult to run the last
few miles of the marathon.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat too
many carbs regularly

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and your body just doesn't
have the metabolic capacity

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to absorb that many, you
just make too much sugar

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:84%
in your blood, and that
extra sugar eventually

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
gets taken up by the
liver and converted

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to fat, which is then sent
to your favorite fat storage

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:90%
places in your body.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So you'll not only
get fat, but you'll

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.605 align:middle line:84%
develop these
advanced glycation end

00:20:00.605 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:84%
products, which are
called AGEs, A-G-E,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.474 align:middle line:90%
and they really do age us.

00:20:06.474 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Age you.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Can you cleanse?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Does cleansing help with
something like that?

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:10.835 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: No.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:10.961 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: There
is no mechanism

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:90%
once you have built up AGEs.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
when you think back

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
in time, before we
had processed foods,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't eat too many carbs.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we
started to process foods,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
more and more people
found they were

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
eating more than their
individual metabolism could

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
handle.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
one of the things

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that I write about in
"The PlantPlus Diet

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Solution" is that
there are very simple

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
tests you can ask your
doctor for to figure out

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
where's your blood
sugar, how you're doing,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
how insulin sensitive
or resistant you are.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
very, very important.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if someone
is hypoglycemic,

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that would mean that
their blood sugar drops

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
too low and too high?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.874 align:middle line:84%
So is there an insulin-related
issue with hypoglycemia?

00:21:08.874 --> 00:21:09.582 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There's an
insulin-related issue.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And generally speaking, if
you're developing hypoglycemia,

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
it's because you're not
metabolizing the carbs well

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
enough, and you
get this bouncing.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what is the solution?

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.932 align:middle line:90%
What is the PlantPlus Diet?

00:21:27.932 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well,
the PlantPlus Solution

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is this, that
generally speaking,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
most people do not eat
enough plants because plants

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
give us not only
the micronutrients,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but they give us
fiber because-- people

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:90%
say, why do we need fiber?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Can I like take Metamucil?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that one of the
biggest scientific discoveries

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of the last 10 years
had to do with the fact

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that we are predominately made
of microbes, a funny odd thing.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
99% of your genetic
material is microbial.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And microbes actually
make the lion's share

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:90%
of your neurotransmitters.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:90%
They keep the gut from leaking.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
functions in the ecosystem

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that we create with them.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have to eat a lot of
plants to feed our microbes.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Because microbes, what we
might think of as probiotics,

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:90%
eat prebiotics, which are fiber.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the problems
we have with health

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
have to do with we're not
feeding our microbes right.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to
problems as varied

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.235 align:middle line:90%
as anxiety and depression--

00:22:45.235 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.776 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: --mental
problems because they're

00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:90%
making our neurotransmitters.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
directly related.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So most of them are toxic
in our body, actually.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
We carry these toxic
chemicals in our body

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that kills the
microbes in our body?

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well,
absolutely antibiotics.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
If you think about meat that's
been raised with antibiotics,

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:90%
the antibiotics get into you.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
They're killing many
of the good bacteria,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're allowing the
overgrowth of bad bacteria.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
significant problem.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We've taken too
many antibiotics.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And right now this is a
very hot field of research

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
reasons for obesity

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
is having the wrong
kind of gut bacteria.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
You can take two
mice and feed them

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
in a way that causes one mice to
have a certain type of bacteria

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and another mice
not to have that--

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:84%
feed them the exact
same amount of calories.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
One mouse will become obese,
and the other will remain lean.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's another part
of our obesity epidemic.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And with the PlantPlus
Diet Solution,

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend that,
with very few exceptions,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.937 align:middle line:84%
you eat a pound of vegetables
a day, which sounds like a lot.

00:24:09.937 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you juice them?

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.847 align:middle line:90%
Do you cook them?

00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:90%
How do you eat them?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: You can eat
them any way you want.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.468 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it doesn't
matter if they're juiced?

00:24:16.468 --> 00:24:18.556 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: I mean, juicing is
lovely, but you need the fiber.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.927 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
throw away the fiber.

00:24:22.927 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: And we do make
smoothies in the morning

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.946 align:middle line:84%
with lots and lots of
vegetables and greens in them

00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and some fruits, maybe
apples and berries,

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
because both my
husband and I don't

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:90%
want to eat too many carbs.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Too many, as we
know, doesn't work

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.869 align:middle line:90%
for our particular metabolisms.

00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here at Joan
talking about the PlantPlus

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Diet Solution.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Of course,
everybody's diet

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
personalized for them.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
My own diet has really
eliminated all grains.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you why.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I used to eat a
breakfast every morning

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:90%
with oatmeal and fruits.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And an hour later, I
was absolutely starved,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and I would have to eat again.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
I, like many people,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:84%
do not do well eating
a diet high in carbs

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
because it makes me hungry.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
eat for breakfast?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I like to have either a big
shake full of delicious things,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
full of berries, full
of full-fat yogurt.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There I get my probiotics,
the good bacteria

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that help me stay thin and
that help my body stay healthy.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I might mix up
a shake like that.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe I have a piece
of my fantastic almond bread.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love this.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It slices beautifully.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I can put it right
in the toaster.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And there's no flour in it.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.245 align:middle line:90%
There's hardly any carbs in it.

00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:09.125 align:middle line:84%
It's actually made of
ground almond flour.

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It's totally delicious.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And I like to spice
it up with some

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of the superfood spices like
cinnamon, spices like ginger.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal
of research on them.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And these can actually
help you neurologically.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, these spices
that are used in India

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
are so important because
in Indian cooking,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.265 align:middle line:84%
you take the spices,
and you put them in oil.

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It makes them bioavailable.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's much less
Alzheimer's disease

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:90%
and dementia in India.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So for breakfast, if
I'm making an omelet,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I might put in various
curry spices, turmeric,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:90%
which has curcumin in it.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to find in
the PlantPlus Diet Solution

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
lots of superfoods.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So breakfast-- delicious almond
bread, maybe a boiled egg,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
maybe an omelette
filled with vegetables,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe a big bowl of
berries, maybe a shake.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:90%
The food is really terrific.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
For lunch, what I generally
eat is an enormous salad.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And by enormous, I mean not the
kind of squidgy little salad

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that you'd find in a bowl
but a big plate just covered

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.140 align:middle line:84%
with greens with lots
of fresh avocado in it.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
My body does very
well with dairy.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So I like to chop up some feta
cheese there, then chop up

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
some kind of lean protein--
chicken or sometimes fish

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:90%
or sardines.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
to have enough protein

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
because protein turns out
to be the skinny food.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And lean protein--
it actually takes

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
your body more calories to
incorporate it than the food

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you're trying
to lose weight,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
vegetables and lean
protein is really

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:90%
going to do the trick for you.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's oftentimes lunch.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes a fabulous salad.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've got some great salad
dressing recipes as well.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.172 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole third
part of the PlantPlus Diet

00:28:25.172 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Solution is all recipes.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Then for dinner-- what
do we eat for dinner?

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important not to have

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:40.576 align:middle line:84%
to cook all the time because
most of us are just too busy.

00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But for dinner, I
often slow cook things.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So for example, whether you
are a vegan, a vegetarian,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
or an omnivore, you can
load up your slow cooker

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
with a tremendous
amount of vegetables.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.755 align:middle line:84%
So your gut bacteria
just love onions.

00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So I like to cook with a lot
of onions and garlic and fennel

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and carrots and celery and put
all these with maybe some plum

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:90%
tomatoes in the slow cooker.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you add the
protein you want.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You can put in chicken.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:90%
You can put in lamb.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:90%
You can put in tempeh.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
You can put in tofu.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You can make something so
delicious and spiced so

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
beautifully that any time
you go to the fridge,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:90%
it's ready to eat.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So in our house,
let me tell you,

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:84%
the food has never,
ever been better.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's really simple.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I cook less than I ever have
before, in some ways, just

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:84%
by concentrating
it-- two days a week.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
something fabulous to eat.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is taking
a probiotic enough

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:90%
in addition to the vegetables?

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Or tell me about the
probiotic concept.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: This is a big
topic of research, for sure.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Should you take probiotics?

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the microbiologists
don't know exactly what

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.390 align:middle line:90%
the best bacteria are.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:90%
We know some of them.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, what most
of them tell you is,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
eat fermented foods-- yogurt
and kefir and sauerkraut

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and pickles-- but not things
that have been processed

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:90%
because it kills the bacteria.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But freshly fermented
things, and that's a help.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can certainly
take probiotics.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you
also have to be careful

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
because many of the
probiotics don't

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:90%
have what's advertised in them.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.962 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The cultured foods
create their own probiotic?

00:30:49.962 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Because what cultures
the food is the fact

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that it's living bacteria
that's fermenting the food.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have various
bacteria-- lactobacillus

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and bacteroides and
things like that that

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:90%
are in those fermented foods.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, all
of this in the diet

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:84%
would make you actually
feel better and allow

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:90%
your brain to feel better.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
books that you wrote

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is the "Inner Peace
for Busy People."

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And it made a difference
for me because it

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:90%
changed different concepts.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that
I could have inner peace

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:90%
without the right diet.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.352 align:middle line:84%
And that's very linked to
what you talk about in there.

00:31:33.352 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good point, Lisa.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why my whole work has
been the mind-body connection.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
what's the diet stuff?

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been like that
elephant in the living room.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can't have a
healthy mind or peacefulness

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
or any type of inner peace
if your body is sick.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Exactly.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.374 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's very true,
and the inner peace-- I just

00:32:00.374 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:90%
want to share this with you.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.165 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you said
to me years and years and years

00:32:04.165 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
ago on my radio show is, there
is no such thing as balance.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This was when I was a
new mother and trying

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.500 align:middle line:84%
to get the work-life
balance figured out.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Joan
how do I achieve

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
this balance, this work-life
balance and the mother thing.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You simply said, there is
no such thing as balance.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yeah.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just-- it's a wrong
word because it implies that

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
every day, you have some of
this and a little of that

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and this time and that time.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not so easy in our culture.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to think of balance
as almost more seasonal.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a time for
winter, a time for spring,

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:90%
a time for summer.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Different things are happening.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But you can reduce
the seasons to a week.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You think about Sabbath.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that's
been around for a long time.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Or the biblical thought of
letting fields lie fallow

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:90%
every seventh year is a type.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't let
the field lie fallow,

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients are used up,
and your crop is reduced.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same with us.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Unless we have time for being
and to lie fallow, we dry up,

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and our work dries up, and we
get irritable and crotchety.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What I learned and have
learned from you over the years

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you can
have times of crazy busyness,

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:33.602 align:middle line:84%
and that's OK as long as it's
followed by downtime, peace.

00:33:33.602 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: Yes.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
You need that.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And your body fortunately
knows how to restore itself.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we can't
do what we'd like to do.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's great if you can
exercise every day.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It's great if you can
put aside some time

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
for some sort of
meditation or some way

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:90%
to regulate your nervous system.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you can't.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is if
you take regular time

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and unplug yourself, your
body knows how to balance.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It restores itself.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:90%
That's called homeostasis.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But it can do that even
in our crazy busy world.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.135 align:middle line:90%
Just give it a chance.

00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It can.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Even if there's
chronic stress where

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.357 align:middle line:84%
it feels like there's no
solution, the looping stress?

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: That's
a different thing.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Chronic looping stress leads
to a feeling of helplessness.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: And if you're
experiencing chronic looping

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
stress, you really
need to deal with it

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
because it might be the result,
for example, of past trauma.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And your nervous
system no longer

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:90%
works the way it used to.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Very, very small stresses get
magnified in an enormous way.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's very important
because chronic stress really

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
is the underlying
basis of almost all

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:84%
of our chronic
illnesses because it

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:84%
leads to chronic
inflammation in the body.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.526 align:middle line:84%
So that you really
have to watch out for.

00:35:01.526 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
ways to resolve it,

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
with meditation and moments
of mindfulness so that you can

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:90%
release that--

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: Well, with trauma
you really have to go back

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.375 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deal with it.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BORYSENKO: There's a
lot of new work on trauma.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But it tends to work less
from thoughts to the body

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and more from the somatic,
from the bodies to the thought.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very,
very important thing

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:90%
is the resolution of old trauma.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'll
say is what we

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
know now is if a parent
is highly traumatized,

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.140 align:middle line:84%
then that can be inherited
by their offspring

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.460 align:middle line:90%
for up to four generations.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.510 align:middle line:90%
This is epigenetic inheritance.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that was true
of me, actually.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
reasons why I went

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
into the field of
mind-body medicine.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I was just stressed out all the
time, just completely a freak.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And I could not figure out why.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I had had
a terrible childhood.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Nothing had happened.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally
realized, oh my,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:90%
12 relatives died in Auschwitz.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.310 align:middle line:84%
My grandparents came
here because they

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:90%
were fleeing from pogroms.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And the changes
that the environment

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:84%
caused in their DNA--
this is new research;

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:84%
it's very exciting--
have been inherited

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:90%
for several generations.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I looked
like a trauma survivor.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And I had to really clear that.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And all I've learned about
meditation, breathing,

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
how to shift the brain has
come in response to that.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So I also want to say if
you're a trauma survivor

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or if you've got
trauma in your family,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at that as a
good thing and not a bad thing

00:36:55.030 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because there's that old
statement that the wounds are

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
where the light
comes in, that those

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:84%
are what you will learn
from the very most

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:84%
in really dealing
with the challenge

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.217 align:middle line:90%
of having chronic stress.

00:37:12.217 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So it causes you to look to
it more and dive into it more

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and realize the things that
can truly, truly help you

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in your life and your
generations to come.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.109 align:middle line:84%
So much has been covered here,
but it all is linked together.

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BORYSENKO: It is.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.819 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

>>BORYSENKO: Thank
you so much, Lisa.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It was really a great interview.

You do such a good job.
