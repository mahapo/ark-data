00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:18.515 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And we are coming to you
live from the Gaiam Studios

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live show, I encourage

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.267 align:middle line:84%
you to interact with us
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I encourage your questions
and your comments

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%
throughout the show.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So please keep
connected with us.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's estimated that
nearly 40% of Americans

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
are currently searching
for their purpose

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
in life, that they are
unsatisfied in their career

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
choice or in their
life in general.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of age
or education, many

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
find themselves stuck in
a job or in situations

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that leaves them feeling
uninspired or unmotivated.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
it is never too late

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
to live a life of overflowing
passion and purpose.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And here to show us
that is Jean Houston.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
She is an author
of over 26 books,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
a leader in the human
potential movement.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And Jean has spent nearly
50 years consulting

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
with heads of state, indigenous
villagers, US presidents, CEOs,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
and luminaries around the globe.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
She is one of the most
highly respected leaders

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
in the human
development movement.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And she is here with us to help
us get out of that daily grind

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and to move into a life filled
with passion and purpose

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and gratitude.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Jean.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: Thank you.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you
for being here.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Thank you,
Lisa, for having me.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.998 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:48.176 align:middle line:90%
And happy birthday, too.

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
You've got a
birthday coming up--

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: A big one.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.563 align:middle line:90%
A big one coming up.

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -which is amazing.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So Jean is with us
and talking to us

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
about your life
and your history.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
What got you started in this
human potential movement?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you
know, I think if I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
were to try to pin it
down very specifically,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
it's two incidents that
happened two weeks apart when

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.422 align:middle line:84%
I was about seven
or eight years old.

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere around there.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And the first began
because my father was a comedy

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:84%
writer, was writing for Edgar
Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
You're too young to remember,
but Charlie McCarthy

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.683 align:middle line:84%
was the little
dummy, the puppet.

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:27.391 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.668 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And Edgar Bergen
was the ventriloquist.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And my father said to
me, hey, Jeaniepot.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to go and
talk to Charlie?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to love to
talk to the little puppet

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
because he would wise crack
and he was lots of fun.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, daddy, let's go.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So we went to
Bergen's hotel room.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.685 align:middle line:84%
And Bergen was sitting
sort of catty corner to us

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we could actually
see part of his face

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
as he was talking
with great intensity

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.807 align:middle line:90%
to his dummy, Charlie McCarthy.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And as he was talking,
my father said,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't write that stuff.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we thought
Bergen was rehearsing.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And because Bergen
was asking Charlie,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.382 align:middle line:90%
the dummy, ultimate questions.

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, what does it
mean to truly love?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.145 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Charlie, where
exactly is the soul?

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, what is
the nature of mind?

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, what can we
do to create a better

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.512 align:middle line:90%
rapport between men and women?

00:03:18.512 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:90%
The ultimate questions.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And this little dummy
with his wooden clacking jaws

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
was answering with the
wisdom of the finest

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
minds of thousands of years.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Bergen
would get so excited

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, but
Charlie, what is

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the difference between the
human being and the nature

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds-- well, Bergen!

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And he'd give these
incredible answers.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So finally, my father who was
an agnostic Baptist from Texas,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't stand
it, and he coughed.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And Bergen turned around,
turned beet red, and said,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
oh, hello, Jack.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Jeanie.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
You caught us.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:90%
And my father said, yeah, Ed.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%
What in the world are you doing?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'm
talking to Charlie.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.895 align:middle line:90%
He's the wisest person I know.

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And my father said,
but Ed, that's you.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually
had seen him talking,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and his eyes were
filled with wonder.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And his mouth was
going like this

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.603 align:middle line:84%
while he was doing
the ventriloquist.

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:15.769 align:middle line:90%
And he said, but that's you.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%
That's your mind, Ed.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
That's your knowledge
coming out of that dummy.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, yeah, I suppose
Jack, ultimately it is.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, when I ask him
these questions and he answers,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I haven't got the faintest
idea of what he's going to say.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And what he says astounds
me with his brilliance.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It is so much more than I know.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, Lisa.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my future
just walking across me.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because it was like
a great electrical flow.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was my future.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
more that we know

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know that we know.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was using a
dummy to get to it.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, hold that story.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, I'm
at my favorite school.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I went to 20 schools
before I was 12, but often--

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because?

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because of my dad
being in show business.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite
school was PS6, which

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:90%
was a hugely progressive school.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And we were taken to meet
the great elders of the time.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And our teacher said
to us, children, today

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
meet Helen Keller.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Helen Keller, who had been-- at
the time she was 19 months old

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:90%
she was deaf, dumb, and blind.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And she read to us-- Miss
Riley, I remember her name was.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.826 align:middle line:84%
She read to us from that
extraordinary autobiography

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of Helen where she says, for
the first six years of my life,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no concepts whatsoever.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I was like a block of wood.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could get through.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher, Anne
Sullivan, had tried in vain

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
to get me associate hand
movements with words.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Finally, in
frustration, she took me

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
out to the ivy-covered pump
house-- this is in Alabama--

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and into one hand she pumped
the cool, clear something.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And the other she tapped
out W-A-T-E-R. W-A-T-E-R.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And Helen writes, I stood still.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly understood what
teacher was tapping out

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
meant that cool,
clear something.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And that word, water, dropped
into my mind like the sun

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:90%
into a frozen winter world.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And I learned the
name for 30 things

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:90%
before the end of that day.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.308 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she
then went on to become

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the great
learners in history.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Other languages, whole
fields of endeavor,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and the great, great helper of
marginalized and disadvantaged

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.671 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.544 align:middle line:84%
With that, we are
put on the bus.

00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:45.504 align:middle line:84%
We go down to the
club where Miss.

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Keller was to meet us.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
We sit down.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Helen Keller comes in.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's probably
about 70 at the time.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Very handsome woman.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Very, very handsome woman.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And she speaks to us in an
awesome voice that has never

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%
heard speech or remembered it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
But she could speak.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was so moved
by what she had

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to say that when they asked, is
there any child there who would

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
like to speak with Miss
Keller, my hand shot up.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea at all
what I was going to say.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I had
to speak with her.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%
So I went forward.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
She placed her entire
hand on my face.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And with the center of her
hand, she read my lips.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And with her fingers, she read
my expression, my character.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I blurted out with
a child's savage honesty,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
why are you so happy?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't think of
why she was so happy.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.101 align:middle line:84%
And she laughed and she
laughed and she laughed and she

00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
said, my child-- this is what
she sounded like-- my child,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
it is because I live each
day as if it were my last.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And life in all its moments
is so full of glory.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And life in all its moments
is so full of glory--

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:90%
was she damaged?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.874 align:middle line:90%
I supposed she was.

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Was she damaged?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.219 align:middle line:90%
Not at all?

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nope.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: She had rewoven
the remaining filaments

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
of her senses into a web in
which she caught reality.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And it gave her
this radical empathy

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about and her
willingness and ability

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%
to help evoke so many others.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have had so
many wonderful examples--

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.353 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, those are
two very major ones.

00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I was devoted to
the so much more.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I was devoted to the fact
that what moment-- what it is

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
like to live in the presence
of the radical present in which

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%
everything is available.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Everything is available.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you come
on and you teach that.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.164 align:middle line:84%
And you've created an
entire movement around this.

00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You are one of-- as I said
earlier-- one of the most

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
respected teachers in the
human potential movement.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:84%
What is that for people that
don't know what that means?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
The human potential movement.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Let me try to
answer in a different way.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Let me try and give you,
very quickly, a sense of what

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:90%
the possible human is.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'm going
to say is something

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that I or others have explored
in studying the human nature

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
either in-- with
individuals or with people

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:90%
in different cultures.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
the possible human

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
enjoys long pleasures
and short pains

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
instead of long pains
and short pleasures.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
She's able to
orchestrate her healing.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
She's able to orchestrate
her breathing, her heartbeat,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
her skin temperature.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:90%
She has this self-orchestration.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Her moods.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
She's able to drop into
alpha for meditation or theta

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and for very deep,
deep creativity.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.511 align:middle line:84%
Or high amplitude
beta for focus.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At the same time

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: She's able to have
a body of great flexibility

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
and keep that body going.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.724 align:middle line:84%
She's able to stay much younger,
something I've been able to do.

00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you have.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.756 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Because I'm 75.

00:10:08.756 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can't believe it.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But the reason is I do
some of these things, you see?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.809 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You embody this?

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Yeah, and that's
why I don't particularly

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
age and scare everybody when
they meet me 50 years later.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.732 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't.

00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:22.315 align:middle line:84%
Especially for people
who are retired,

00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
who look at that as
the end of their life,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
as an end-of-life
sentence, and stop living.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: And stop living.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can live as
long as you want to.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying absolutely.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it happens
between the ears.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.438 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But there's
so many other things.

00:10:35.438 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You can tap into the
great creative treasure

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
house, the workshops of
the mind for entertainment,

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
for creativity,
for finding answers

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to new kind of solutions.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:90%
You can think in images.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
You can think in words.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
You can think with
your whole body.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You can tap into
the fact that you

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
have many, many, many different
personalities within you,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
some of which come rather
well equipped with all kinds

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:90%
of skills.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:84%
You can get a greatly
enhanced memory.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: You can plan
and design and create

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
creative structures.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You can tap into the
larger story for yourself

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and begin to live it out.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
You can be in touch with
archetypal, energetic guidance

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that then is with
you on your journey.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
You can be always living daily
life as spiritual exercises,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.592 align:middle line:84%
deeply touching into and
sourced by the great oneness

00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:90%
of which we are a part.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
There's so much, much more
of the possible human.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have such a
passion for the possible.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You have a passion for what
is possible in human beings

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and what is possible--

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, I've seen it,
and you want to spread it.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how do you
explain that for our culture?

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You say that this is
the most critical time

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.365 align:middle line:90%
in history to live.

00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Absolutely.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.185 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, it is critical
because, first of all,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%
it's radically original.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday looks
nothing like today.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Today looks nothing
like tomorrow.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The changes are coming
so thick and fast.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Most people live
anywhere between 5,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
10, even 100 times the amount
of sheer experience compared

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.279 align:middle line:84%
to their ancestor of,
let's say, 150 years ago.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: We haven't
been trained for that.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So I say to people,
everybody gets wounded.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You're so full of holes,
you've become holy.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Which has a certain
value because it

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
makes you vulnerable
and available.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is everything is
changing so very, very rapidly.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
never before have we

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
had so much responsibility
placed on us.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
We have now become
the co-directors

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.867 align:middle line:84%
of a world that up to now
has mostly directed us.

00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:90%
We are now at the effect.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We are able to affect things
much, much more than we ever

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:90%
have been able to.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I think people feel
more empowered amidst

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the disempowerment that
is being put down on us.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe the same thing?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you can
only be put down so long.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the life forces,
the life fires begin to rise.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
collectively

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.020 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I have reason to be able to say
that because my claim to fame

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is I'm one of the best traveled
human beings who ever lived.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many countries
have you traveled to?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, I don't
know how many countries.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you how many
countries I've worked in.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.704 align:middle line:90%
I've worked in 108 countries.

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 108 countries.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I've probably
been in many more, but I--

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When you say worked in--

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I mean I've worked,
I've lectured, I've taught,

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I've trained I've done
all kinds of things.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've lived with
indigenous cultures and--

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.285 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, yes, some longer
and some short, but yes.

00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of our Facebook
questions is coming in.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Maggie is saying, how do I find
that deep source within me?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:84%
How do I find that
divine potential?

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.888 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you come
and study with me.

00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Read some of my books.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Jean Houston's mystery school.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But that's
just a cavalier answer.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, first of
all, you believe it.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to live as if it's
there with you all the time.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the best exercises I
show is to get people in touch

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:90%
with a higher guidance.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would have you
stand up, you see.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would have you accept that
standing opposite-- your eyes

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:90%
are closed-- is this high self.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
This self as if
you'd had 1,000 years

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to do your human homework.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the essential self.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It's called the higher self,
who looks upon you with so much

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
love, with so much
empowerment, with so much

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
deep, deep acceptance
and affection

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel yourself
empowered, acknowledged.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're being so deeply
nourished and cherished

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
and loved and called forth.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And knowing this, knowing
this and accepting it,

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and as you begin to
really experience

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
this on a daily basis and it
gets stronger and stronger.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize that you
have a companion for life.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
A higher guidance that is
with you that is itself

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
sourced from the very
source of reality.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.473 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:15:03.473 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is how to rise
beyond the "you are not enough"

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
story that we have
been so conditioned by,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:90%
that we are not enough.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel that we
are changing as our story

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.714 align:middle line:90%
as humanity?

00:15:18.714 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you know,
the story is changing.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
We now know that we don't
just live in the universe.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%
The universe lives in us.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
We are citizens in a universe
larger than our aspiration,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
more complex than
all our dreams,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
nearer than hands and feet,
closer than breathing.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It is in us.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
This shift felt-- not just
known intellectually--

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but when it is felt
and lived from,

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
provides the people that
I have known who live out

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of this, like Margaret
Mead or Deepak Chopra,

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and others that we can name.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They live with a state
of grace and opportunity

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and what my Sicilian grandmother
referred to as abbondanza.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.981 align:middle line:90%
It goes way beyond abundance.

00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Abbondanza.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
You are living in the fertile
fields of possibility.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And you say yes to life
instead of complaining.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.697 align:middle line:84%
And you look at challenges as
opportunities and workloads.

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some may say that might
be easy for you, Jean Houston,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
but how do I do it
when I've lost my loved

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%
one and my job and my house?

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell that person?

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.705 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, one
thing is that--

00:16:27.705 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is very hard to say
because, obviously, everybody

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
has a unique story-- but
you don't dwell in it.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You say, what is the opportunity
for another kind of living?

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:90%
What am I being pulled toward?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
What is the work that I
really would love to do

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and how can I go
about-- and then

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
you build up the structures
of the expectation of grace.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
You build up the
structures in yourself.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:90%
You touch it.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You hear it.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:90%
You incarnate.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You dramatize it.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You begin to send out
the probability waves.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And you keep it going.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And you don't let
yourself fall too long

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:90%
into the dread and the despair.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.735 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
do, unfortunately,

00:17:08.735 --> 00:17:09.610 align:middle line:90%
what you appreciate--

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disappears.

00:17:10.485 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: -is what appreciates.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
What you hold on to is
going to hold on to you.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the great
irony of being human.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
That, well, for one thing,
we are a very interesting

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
collection of different
evolutionary strands.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The ocean runs
briny in our veins.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We have the ancient, ancient
brain, that little reptilian

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
complex that protects us.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:90%
That survives.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:90%
But it also makes us, whoa!

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Overreact as if we were
in ancient caves being

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
chased by a woolly mastodon.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the thundering herds

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
of mammalian beasts
in our limbic system.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
curious frontal lobe,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
this new brain that is both--
is a trickster and an enchanter

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.704 align:middle line:90%
and brilliant and curious--

00:17:58.704 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Curious.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: -and weird, too.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So we really are
remaking our minds.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.042 align:middle line:84%
And the thing-- this new
field of neuroplasticity.

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:90%
The plasticity.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
The changeableness of the brain,
which is growing all the time--

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our brains--

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.575 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -allows us to
do things with our mind.

00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I teach is

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
how to gain many different
other layers of intelligence

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't know
you had by learning

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
how to talk to the brain
much more directly.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.392 align:middle line:90%
And there's ways of doing that.

00:18:28.392 --> 00:18:30.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to-- you
can't just leave us with that.

00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:90%
You have to share.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Oh, that's
a long exercise.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To access different
levels of the brain,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:90%
to live in that quantum field.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.346 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And also realize
what kind of mind you have.

00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have a very,
very auditory kind of mind,

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's also very
right hemisphere.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I tend to see things as a
whole whereas my husband would

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.127 align:middle line:84%
tend to see things in a very
linear and analytic manner.

00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I understand.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.288 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So I might
do an exercise

00:18:55.288 --> 00:18:57.102 align:middle line:84%
where we would close
our eyes and we'd

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
breathe-- have a sense of
breathing into the brain.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then in the left hemisphere,
we would see circles.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
On the right hemisphere,
we'd see circles.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Left hemisphere, triangles.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Triangles.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:90%
A galaxy.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
A galaxy.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And that got the
eyes-- which are

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
part of the brain--
activating the brain.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
give you images.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You're walking down a street
on the left part of the brain

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.414 align:middle line:84%
and you see a marching
band coming toward you.

00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the left brain.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
On the right brain, you
are in a garden of roses

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and you are picking roses.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You would just do many
images back and forth,

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:90%
back and forth, back and forth.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.737 align:middle line:90%
This engages the brain.

00:19:34.737 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
you can do with it.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, but
that's a good start.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.704 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And then you would keep
your eyes spiraling, spiraling.

00:19:39.704 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, you would then

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.706 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of breathing into
the brain, feeling it expand.

00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Expand, expand way out.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Taking it back in,
let it contract.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Expand.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Taking it back.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Back and forth.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you might tap on
your head and say, dear brain,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
let us be friends.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
From here on, I ask
you that we can--

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
me, my conscious self,
and you, my brain--

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
can work together
in so many ways.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And from here on, a
beautiful friendship begins.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And dear brain,
I really want you

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
to use more and help
me to use more of you.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep
talking until you

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:84%
have that sense of a deep
intimacy with the brain

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and mind system.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that how you--

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.603 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: That would be
a way of doing things.

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how you
make friends with that mind

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:90%
chatter--

>>JEAN: It becomes a great ally.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.539 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -with that negative
mind chatter though?

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, because
you have overridden it.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the intelligi exercise
that I just showed you,

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
being with that higher self,
that essential self that

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
holds the larger pattern
and probability for you.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And that, then, taps you
into a much deeper destiny.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Not an ordinary destiny,
but the deeper destiny

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It trumps the negative
mind chatter because it gives

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
us such a larger purpose,
which is, basically,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
one of your main messages
is the greater, the grander

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
the purpose and the passion,
the more you will thrive.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:90%
The more--

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.636 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you
say yes to life.

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.154 align:middle line:84%
And you don't just
get tripped up

00:21:04.154 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
by every little thing
that comes along--

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I think--

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -because
your story is larger

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:90%
than these little things.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, this is true.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.348 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Or big things
as the case may be.

00:21:11.348 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen Jean
speak at various events,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and she's so passionate and
motivated when she's speaking.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a look at this clip.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We have her at one of the
events that she's speaking at.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.594 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
-We are a very fortunate
group of people.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
We really are because we
have an extraordinary reason

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:90%
for being on Earth.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.566 align:middle line:84%
And this, the most important
time in human history--

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
other times thought
they were it.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.523 align:middle line:90%
They're wrong.

00:21:43.523 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The early years of
the new millennium.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.485 align:middle line:84%
Our job, our holy task,
our great privilege

00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:90%
is to help to bring about peace.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Peace that is so rich, so
full of flavor that it makes

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
sense to make peace.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
To shift the dangerous and
fearful war-embracing patterns

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.946 align:middle line:84%
of century to offer a rich
and evocative alternative.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:08.445 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:22:08.445 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
-Yes!

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
-Many years ago, I was
on a late-night program.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
1, 2 o'clock.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.755 align:middle line:84%
And some you are
going to be pushing

00:22:16.755 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
your books at 1 and 2 o'clock in
the morning, but I'll tell you

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
what happens is after
awhile you fall asleep.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And your mouth keeps on going.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're sort
of stunned at what

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:90%
you have found yourself saying.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
myself saying was

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that many of the images, the
concepts of peace that most

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
of us grew up with
is simply too tame.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.504 align:middle line:90%
Peace should be alluring.

00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:43.545 align:middle line:90%
It should be fascinating.

00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It should be challenging.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
In a word, I said,
peace should be sexy.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, and that's--

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Sexy peace.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sexy peace.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.477 align:middle line:90%
That is perfect.

00:22:52.477 --> 00:22:54.226 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of great
questions coming in

00:22:54.226 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:90%
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Bruce is asking, what do
you really think about 2012?

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Is it really an age
of enlightenment?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: I don't know.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of that hilarious
cartoon in the New Yorker

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
several years back where
it's 1,000 years ago

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.584 align:middle line:84%
and it's the ancient
Mayans and you

00:23:10.584 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:90%
see the pyramid in the back.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And one guy comes along and he's
rolling along a big calendar

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
stone.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.452 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I ran out of
stone when I got up to 2012.

00:23:20.452 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy
says, boy, that's

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:84%
going to freak out
somebody someday.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.965 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Profoundly stated, Jean.

00:23:26.965 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: I don't know.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it this way.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether it means
something or not.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
To the Mayans, it means
the end of one era

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of a new era.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it means.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.525 align:middle line:84%
So much expectation
has been laid on it--

00:23:40.525 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Are we reaching for something?

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it a back to purpose?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: We're reaching
for something.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
We're using that because
supposedly the procession

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of the equinox is every 26,000
years a new era, the Aquarian

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
However it happens, people
are yearning for something.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So when my old friend,
Jose Arguelles,

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
began to talk it up
years ago, it caught on.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It caught on.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.631 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think it's also
an example of people looking

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.088 align:middle line:84%
for-- I mean, there's deep
ancient history around it,

00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
but people really wanting to
grab on to a sense of purpose.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Wanting to grab on to
something structural in time

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.497 align:middle line:84%
that would allow them to
restructure themselves

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:90%
and their societies.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very well put.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Again, a question coming in.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Sharon from Facebook is asking,
how do we find our purpose?

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I get asked that question all
the time on my radio show.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure you do as well.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.048 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, I do a
whole course on that

00:24:31.048 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
with evolving wisdom,
which is coming up.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And if people go to my
website, jeanhouston.com,

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:90%
you'll find other opportunities.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they can train with
you as well, which is great.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: They can train with me.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.108 align:middle line:90%
I really train people--

00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amazing.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But one of the things
that we find about purpose

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, not to
get too hung up about it.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:90%
You have to be playful about it.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You even have to laugh
at yourself about it.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not get too
serious about ourselves.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.528 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: One of the
things that I do

00:24:57.528 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is have people-- in an
earlier show that we did,

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I have you activate
your inner imageries.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.624 align:middle line:84%
Your seeing, touching,
hearing, smelling.

00:25:04.624 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Look at my book, "A
Passion for the Possible."

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:90%
That has a lot of that.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:12.361 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
get a smaller purpose.

00:25:12.361 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Something that you want to
accomplish in three months.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.235 align:middle line:84%
And you see it and
you touch it and you

00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
feel it and you drum
it and you dance it.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And it then gives you a
passionate hormonal energizers,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:90%
neuronal enthusiasts.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.307 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself with
a momentum to accomplish.

00:25:28.307 --> 00:25:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You use all five senses.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Once you start--
you use all of your senses.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the senses
often have access

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to deeper purposes than
your linear everyday mind.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.905 align:middle line:84%
You use the intelligi exercise
I just showed you, also

00:25:41.905 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:90%
in "A Passion for the Possible."

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Because with the
intelligi exercise,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
you feel yourself accompanied
by that essence, that higher

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
sense that also knows
your higher purposes.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.637 align:middle line:84%
So you don't feel just blatantly
running solo or alone in this.

00:25:57.637 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.284 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes us
tired and burns us out.

00:26:00.284 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we'll be
back with Jean Houston, talking

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:84%

We're talking about "A
Passion for the Possible."

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So Jean, when we find out
what our purpose is, how do we

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
stay focused on that
and not get kicked off

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of track with all the
distractions in life

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and paying bills and all the
things that get in our way?

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
How do you stay focused
on that passion?

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, you do
pay attention to it.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:90%
You write about it.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:90%
If only 10 words every day.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You add something to
it, to your reflections.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, what you
appreciate appreciates.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You always keep it as sacred
time within which you see it,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
you touch it, you
taste it, you dance it.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:90%
You discuss it.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:84%
You write a journal about it,
adding little pieces every day.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:90%
You add more.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
You draw it.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.480 align:middle line:90%
You picture it.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you do these
things and you build up

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the internal
complement of it, it

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:84%
tends to drive you
towards the opportunities,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.377 align:middle line:84%
as well as it drives the
opportunities toward you.

00:27:41.377 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It works both ways--

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.376 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does, doesn't it?

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -in this
dialogical universe.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.135 align:middle line:84%
And you do tend that you
find that you stay focused.

00:27:48.135 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you're
working with all five senses

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and you put your
purpose into all

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and you experience it
in all five senses,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.301 align:middle line:84%
you're deeply ingraining it
into the neurology of the body,

00:27:56.301 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.603 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Among other things
and through the feeling

00:27:59.603 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
states and the heart states.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
You're cooking on
more burners about it.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So now how does that then
attract things to your life?

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
What are your opinions
about the law of attraction

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that's been so
written about and is

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
a huge section in
the bookstores?

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well,
everything is attraction

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:90%
attracting everything else.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You look at protons,
neutrons, electrons.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
You look at the way
we are attracted

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:84%
toward the sun,
the sun toward us.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.389 align:middle line:84%
Everything is based on
these powers of attraction.

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps
the universe going.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would
all fly apart.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It is essential to not
only the cosmic agenda,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:90%
but to the human agenda as well.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that, basically, what
one of your mentors, Teilhard

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
de Chardin, was
talking about when

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:84%
he looked at life
with full potential

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.225 align:middle line:84%
and all of the deepness
and the richness of life?

00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, was
that what he was

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:84%
doing was looking into and
pulling out that and attracting

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:90%
the passion in the universe?

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: He had a passionate
sense of the universe

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
as yearning for
us-- or the God is

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
what he would call it--
the Christ yearning for us

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
much more than we
are yearning for it.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And there is that learning
going on all the time.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
When little Dorothy
in "The Wizard of Oz"

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
starts yearning for the
land over the rainbow,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:84%
the land over the rainbow
begins to yearn for her

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and sends in a tornado
to take her there.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But I've just seen
so often when people change

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:84%
their belief systems about how
things work, everything shifts.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Belief structures reality.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll say it again.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.502 align:middle line:90%
Belief structures reality.

00:29:35.502 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just an
intellectual belief.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It gets to be visceral.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It moves in your
nerves and sinews.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know that as you put
out these different energies,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
attracted to you magnified.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:90%
We are walking magnets.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.057 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep putting out
a steady soup of muddy--

00:29:54.057 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Complaining.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -complaining,
kvetching, whining,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
it back in spades.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I've made really
very significant studies over

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:90%
my life--

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you share?

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -of the
great manifestors.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably, they are
putting out conscious intention,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
conscious picturing, seeing,
living out of what is there.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And what is there as a
potential begins to then

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.765 align:middle line:84%
come and manifest in the
concretion of space and time.

00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You were
telling me about that.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That you created
an entire course

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.364 align:middle line:90%
around studying 18 people who--

00:30:29.364 --> 00:30:29.863 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: 55.

00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:30.316 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 55.

00:30:30.316 --> 00:30:30.982 align:middle line:90%
God, forgive me.

00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: It wasn't a course.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It was an actual
study of 55 of some

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
of the most sustained
manifestors and creative people

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.941 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where does
someone find that?

00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, a lot of
them were friends of mine.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Margaret Mead, Buckminster
Fuller, Joseph Campbell,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Jonas Salk.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:90%
I can go on and on.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And a lot
of people who I

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:84%
said whose names
you wouldn't know.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But they had
sustained creativity.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were all fascinated
by their own inner minds.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And they used these inner minds.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They would realize
that their mind was

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:84%
like a supersaturated
solution, and they

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:90%
had to activate it with images.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So they would drop in
feeling, touching, tasting,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:84%
whatever was the
theorem or the problem

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
or the thing they
wanted to deal with.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if in the
creative depths of the mind

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:90%
there was a concretion.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It was as if this seed
crystal of possibility

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that they had so coated with
ideas and thoughts and needs

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:90%
would then begin to constellate.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And the supersaturated
solution of the field

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of mind and intelligence,
of creativity

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
would begin to rise up
and give them answers.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
crystallized and formed

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
into whatever it was that they
were attracting or believing

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Yes, but very concrete
answers coming, as well as

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:90%
opportunities.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just
what was rising up

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:84%
as a creative
solution in the mind.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a creative
activity in the world.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You told me a story
about Margaret Mead and--

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Oh, that
was so wonderful.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
She was the luckiest
person I ever saw.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.092 align:middle line:90%
Deepak is also like that.

00:32:04.092 --> 00:32:05.216 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like intentionally?

00:32:05.216 --> 00:32:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: They live in a
state of expect and grace.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Very intentionally.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.204 align:middle line:90%
Very intentionally.

00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big key.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So Margaret
and I are walking--

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.659 align:middle line:84%
I'll change some names because
I gave you the real name-- we

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
were walking along and she
was going, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm so angry.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I have to have this answer
to this particular thing that

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.270 align:middle line:84%
happened in a New Guinea
tribe, and I need it

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:84%
for a very critical speech
I'm giving tomorrow.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:90%
I have to have it.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I cannot find it.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Wah, wah wah.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:90%
A woman comes up.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Dr. Mead, you don't know me.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Your name is Linda Blitstein.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You were in my class
in 1947, and you never

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:90%
finished your paper.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The memory.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.306 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Terribly acute memory.

00:32:46.306 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, Dr. Mead that's true.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I went on
and I developed my paper

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.586 align:middle line:84%
for my master's
thesis, which is on--

00:32:52.586 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the thing
that Margaret needed.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.904 align:middle line:84%
Margaret grabs her and
says, you come home with me.

00:32:57.904 --> 00:32:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was like
luck constellating.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, I've
never seen anybody so lucky

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.915 align:middle line:90%
She said, yes, I am blessed.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, why are you so blessed?

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.382 align:middle line:90%
Because I expect to be.

00:33:09.382 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Because I expect to be.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
really how she lived.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: She lived
in expectant grace.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.024 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deepak the same?

00:33:14.024 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Deepak in
a different way,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.810 align:middle line:90%
using more scientific concepts.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of the
quantum reality

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of which is continuously
filled with these potencies,

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and you know yourself
that you don't just

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
live in the universe; the
universe lives in you.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And you make your mind.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:84%
He does it with deep meditation
in a state in which he

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
will also drop in the intention
and the reality constellates

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So how do you do it?

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
How do you create that
limitless possibility?

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I dance
it, and I sing it.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I come out of a
dramatic background.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in show business.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So with me, it isn't very quiet.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.679 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:33:50.679 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's through
Shakespeare, isn't it?

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And Shakespeare
and well, and great poetry.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.515 align:middle line:84%
I take, for example, a poem
that to me is so important.

00:34:00.515 --> 00:34:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the most important
poem of the 20th century.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.682 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is it?

00:34:03.682 --> 00:34:05.014 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: It's by Christopher Fry.

00:34:05.014 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
It appears in his play,
"A Sleep of Prisoners."

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, "The human heart
can go to the lengths of God.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Dark and cold we may be,
but this is no winter now.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The frozen misery of centuries
cracks, breaks, begins to flow.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.019 align:middle line:84%
The flooding is the
flooding of the--"

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and I've forgotten the rest
of it-- the upstart spring.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in the upstart spring.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank God, our time is now.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
When wrong comes up to
meet us everywhere, never

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:84%
to leave us till we take the
longest stride of soul men

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:90%
ever took.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Affairs are now soul size.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:84%
The exploration
is-- The enterprise

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:90%
is exploration into God.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:90%
What are you making for?

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:84%
It takes so many
thousand years to wake,

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
but will you wake
for pity's sake!

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So great poetry like that
turns me on, gets me going,

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I drop in ideas.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes!

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I can feel that.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel that?

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You, Jean, had an amazing
reciting of a Shakespearean--

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:90%
not even.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.891 align:middle line:90%
An entire scene--

00:35:16.891 --> 00:35:17.765 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: 16th century.

00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:84%
16th century English sounds
on the stage at that time.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.735 align:middle line:84%
You have an amazing
memory as well.

00:35:22.735 --> 00:35:24.566 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Well, I rehearse it.

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep my memories
going because it's

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
the nature of my
life and teaching.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intentionally, yes.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So and people can
train with you, right?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.922 align:middle line:90%
They can become--

00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Oh, yeah.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of opportunities.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.135 align:middle line:84%
If they go to my website,
jeanhouston-- one word.

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Houston spelled as in
Texas-- jeanhouston.com

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll find all kinds
of possibilities.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, great.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Some more of the
Facebook questions

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:90%
are coming in for Jean Houston.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes, go ahead.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Valerie is
asking that she's

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:90%
been at the Occupy gatherings.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And how can stay an empowered
leader to stop this movement?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:90%
What can she do?

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Empowered
leader to keep it going?

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, she wants to keep
the movement going, but, yeah,

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:84%
she specifically
says, how does she

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.412 align:middle line:84%
stay energized to keep
the movement going?

00:36:10.412 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, I've been
working with the Occupy

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Movement for some time.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But people call me
from all over the world

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and say, Jean, help
us because we're so

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:90%
filled with negativity.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what are you for?

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not just you're
against the 1%.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Rather than
what you're against.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: What are
you going towards?

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to create places,
safe houses for battered women?

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to
create places where

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
people can start
building-- having

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:84%
wonderful gardens in the parks
or make their own food up

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:90%
on the tops of roofs?

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
What are the specific things?

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They have to feel
successful in doing things

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:84%
so it is not just an
intellectual or a protest

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We're moving the power
back to the people.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what it is about.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what the
whole movement is about, yes.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.666 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And so what I do is I
gather them together and let

00:36:58.666 --> 00:36:59.690 align:middle line:90%
them think forward.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:90%
They pay it forward.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:90%
They think it forward.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then from that,
they begin to do things.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then what they do
then generates more.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And it generates greater
teams and greater community.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's very well
said because I think right now

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:84%
there is so much more
potential, as you had stated,

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.539 align:middle line:84%
for the power to be back in
the hands of the people--

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:20.413 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Very much so.

00:37:20.413 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -in small communities.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: In small communities.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that will eventually
make a larger difference.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.092 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- that its
happening so much more.

00:37:27.092 --> 00:37:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: I believe that.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it happened
in indigenous cultures.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's how true
change was ever made

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and shifts of government
and hierarchy was ever made.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, going back to
another great question

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:90%
from our Facebook asker, Mick.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Will things on the planet get
worse before they get better?

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Good one.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Well, I don't know.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.592 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a seer in that way.

00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are wise, though.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But I would say
that things are always

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:90%
getting worse.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And things are always
getting better.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's what is
the perspective.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:84%
If you take it as an opportunity
in work clothes, what

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I personally think is
that our financial systems

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
are at the sunset effect
of their old order

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.565 align:middle line:84%
and are probably
going to decline.

00:38:14.565 --> 00:38:15.731 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many have said that.

00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we may have
different kinds of money.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Different kinds of
money that belong

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to individual
communities, rather than

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
just going often to big banks.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like if
the $100 that you spent

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:84%
for a bicycle, that
$50 was really-- it's

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:84%
called green money, was
in the community and $50

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
then went elsewhere,
wherever it has to go.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many, many
new-- so much new thinking

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
about creative uses, the
creative forms of money.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see a lot
within the next 5 and 10 years.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
things getting worse,

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.430 align:middle line:90%
the climates are getting worse.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But with it comes the
opportunity to get together

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and to really
start doing things.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.991 align:middle line:84%
Even the small things can
have the largest effects.

00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a not so much
is it going to get worse.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It's how do I build
myself not to just

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:84%
survive, but to actualize
new ways of being, which

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:90%
is where we are now.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And doing.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And as you said,
bring it into all five senses.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And if enough people
do that and really

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.359 align:middle line:84%
visualize peace
in the way that we

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
would like to see
it on this planet--

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But concrete, going
out and doing something.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Visualization will
take you so far.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.042 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got to have very
particular things you're

00:39:36.042 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:90%
doing in the community.

things you do is

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.074 align:middle line:90%
you tune into your neighborhood.

00:39:40.074 --> 00:39:41.698 align:middle line:84%
It's far more
interesting than anything

00:39:41.698 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:90%
you'll see on television.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.084 align:middle line:90%
It's weirder and more eccentric.

00:39:45.084 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Tune into your neighborhood.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.791 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:39:46.791 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: And have assets.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
A-S-S-E-T-S. Assets
of the community.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Who is able to do this?

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Who is able to do that?

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Begin to bring people
together and begin

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to engender because everybody
has the great calling

00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.976 align:middle line:90%
of a higher dream.

00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
The higher dream
that's trying to rise.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have
that around you?

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you attract
the right people

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to work with you and your
goals and your visions?

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because I
hold the dreams.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.685 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: I really do.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And any conversation
that I have that I know

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:84%
has to go deeper,
that's what we do.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:84%
In the last two days,
just being here,

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with a
very great musician who

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:84%
has a serious, serious
illness, to help

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
him find his next stage.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a very, very
great spiritual teacher, rabbi

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:84%
to help him discover
the new book that

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:36.746 align:middle line:90%
is in him that has to be.

00:40:36.746 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with--
we can go on and on.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:39.078 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have.

00:40:39.078 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:90%
You just inspire people.

>>JEAN: You're there for them.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I look at everybody in a state
of wonder and astonishment.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I see the god seed.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they try very hard to
try to convince me otherwise,

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.920 align:middle line:90%
but I maintain that seeing.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Deep what is India-- Hindu
is called deep darshan.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Deep, deep seeing
and receptivity.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I watched
you study people

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
as you've had interactions
with people throughout the day.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You look at everything
to do with the behavior

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
of the person, and
you study us, and it'

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
been such a wonderful experience
to spend the day with you

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and to watch how deeply engaged
you truly are with each person

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:90%
that you come into contact with.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:90%
I really see that.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And Jean also does that
when she does her lectures.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:84%
We have another clip here of
an amazingly inspiring lecture

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.090 align:middle line:90%
that Jean gave.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.720 align:middle line:90%

sap-rising concept,
this peacemaking.

it renews both individuals

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of your work now
in this most critical time

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:53.910 align:middle line:84%
in human history is
about regenesis, renewal.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Running past the old
cemetery of dead ideas

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to create
new ways of being.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Because what the world
so desperately needs at

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:90%
this time is patterns.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Patterns for peaceful,
passionately creative,

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and effective societies.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And with it,
peaceful, passionately

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:90%
creative, and effective people.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the possible
human and the possible society.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.715 align:middle line:90%
And now, look around.

00:42:22.715 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Look around at all the
radiant beings around you.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:90%
The radiant intelligence.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
The astonishing

A lot of great questions

You've had amazing
mentors in your life.

But what is it now
that inspires you?

>>JEAN: Well, you know,
I read and I reread.

00:43:06.945 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I read a great deal.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I read in science.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:90%
I read in physics.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I read in consciousness.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I read in world affairs.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm actually in this
kind of plenum of muchness,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and I really cannot point to--
I always have a great novel

going.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A novel?

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I always have
a great novel going.

>>JEAN: Always, always.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I read an
extraordinary novel

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.780 align:middle line:84%
called "The Song
of Achilles," which

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is a retelling of
the Trojan War.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.607 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
am a Greek scholar.

00:43:34.607 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I noticed your necklace.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: And so I read poetry.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I read things that are--
that make your mind

just begin to sing.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And I do read the New Scientist.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.010 align:middle line:90%
I read Parabola for myth.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.209 align:middle line:84%
So I keep many different
channels going simultaneously.

00:43:56.209 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I understand
you are, yourself,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.916 align:middle line:90%

And we may do it first

It takes the "Wizard of Oz" as
a journey of transformation,

and showing how the
different stages of a journey

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:84%
help us activate our minds
in new ways, our heart,

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
our courage, our risk,
our ideas, and ultimately,

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.549 align:middle line:84%
the wizard, the great magus
who lies within each one of us.

00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We will look
forward to that.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite books

And I love how you
explain that we've

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:36.480 align:middle line:84%

jump of evolution.

Nothing much happening

time in our history

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.320 align:middle line:84%

things are happening
unique in human history.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier to
some, the world mind

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.030 align:middle line:90%

We are interconnected, densely
interconnected networks.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.500 align:middle line:90%
An elder age, by any chance?

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, it
depends on the society.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:84%
In some places elder is
35 years old, you know.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And they are activating men
to become what they can be.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They are activating the young
men and the young women.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And often, they've
had their babies.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They've done their basic
professional or whatever it is,

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and now they are devoted
to the betterment

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.239 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and their
communities and societies.

00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And making
real, true change.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And many, many,
many great men too.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying, when
you look at the percentages,

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:90%
it's very interesting.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.746 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because with
women, the emphasis

00:46:33.746 --> 00:46:36.390 align:middle line:84%
is on the process of making
things go here and develop

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.924 align:middle line:90%
and grow.

00:46:36.924 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have heard
that from several people,

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.923 align:middle line:84%
several different guests
have said the same thing.

00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, when you go around
the world, it's very apparent.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in your experience
and from what you're

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:84%
doing with your travels, are
you going into communities

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:84%
where there are primarily
dominating women

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:90%
running the communities?

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: No, no.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.135 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't put it that way.

00:46:58.135 --> 00:47:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I would just say that
doing the creative work

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and the followthrough and
not giving up and coming up

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:06.790 align:middle line:84%
with the ideas, about 70%,
I would say, are women.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
in our lifetime

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you would see the shift to a
female president of the United

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:90%
States?

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes, I think so.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:14.759 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:47:14.759 --> 00:47:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Without a hesitation
you say that.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And why do you say that?

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Oh, you're ask
an embarrassing question.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of knowledge
about some of these things.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it's women's
time in America.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.470 align:middle line:84%
They are there in many other
countries and leading the ways

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and also in their Congresses
and the Parliaments.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.170 align:middle line:84%
America's actually
fairly backward

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:84%
compared to other
countries in terms

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.756 align:middle line:84%
of women's participation
in the political domain.

00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it
has definitely--

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: But wait a minute.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me go deeper than that.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not just political.

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Politics comes from an
ancient Greek term, politeia.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And politeia really means
can people in community

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
deeply involved with and
cocreatively creating

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.240 align:middle line:90%
better communities.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.707 align:middle line:90%
Politeia.

00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.039 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:03.039 --> 00:48:04.510 align:middle line:90%
It has a--

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So I think it's much
more back to the people.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going
to see in our time

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:84%
the ends of these very strict
hierarchies and much more

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.995 align:middle line:84%
community service,
community involvements.

00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
everywhere now.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And I believe the--

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because the old
hierarchical forms have failed.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I believe
that the internet

00:48:23.924 --> 00:48:25.355 align:middle line:90%
connects us a lot with that.

00:48:25.355 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Very much so.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you seen that
in all of your mentors

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that you've been raised with
and spoken with and interviewed

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen that they
have been driving back

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.805 align:middle line:84%
towards that power to the people
or community-based or inner

00:48:41.805 --> 00:48:42.305 align:middle line:90%
mind?

00:48:42.305 --> 00:48:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Oh, yes.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Certainly, Margaret Mead.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:44.809 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:46.200 align:middle line:90%
She believed absolutely in that.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller, an old
friend of mine, very much so.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell with his
seeing the new storying

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.510 align:middle line:90%
that was trying to arise.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.570 align:middle line:90%
I would have to say yes.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is in--
I saw you speak

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.280 align:middle line:84%
at this conference, the
Evolutionary Leaders

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Conference in UCLA a while ago.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.770 align:middle line:90%
A couple of years ago.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
gave a speech there

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:15.520 align:middle line:84%
that had 2,000 of us on our
feet, jumping up in the air.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It was about jump time, the
very thing that you wrote about.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.574 align:middle line:84%
And it was by far the most
inspirational moment because I

00:49:22.574 --> 00:49:24.990 align:middle line:84%
guess what you did is with
everything that you talk about;

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
you got into all
of our neurology

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:84%
about jumping up,
rising to the occasion.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Rising to
the occasion, yes.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Being connected
deeply with our passion

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and our purpose.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Even talking about it
makes me come alive.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And you have it here.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to share
that with our audience?

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:44.177 align:middle line:90%
Did you write this?

00:49:44.177 --> 00:49:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes, I wrote this.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course, you did.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.441 align:middle line:84%
What inspired you to write
this particular piece?

00:49:48.441 --> 00:49:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: The study
of-- that this is

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.810 align:middle line:84%
a singularity, the
uniqueness of our moment.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
we are part-- we

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.665 align:middle line:84%
are at the very frontal
edge of a whole new order

00:49:58.665 --> 00:50:02.487 align:middle line:84%
of the jumps that began
with the big bang.

00:50:02.487 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:90%
So would you like me to do that?

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.135 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I would.

00:50:04.135 --> 00:50:04.730 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.896 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stand up,
and we're going to do this.

00:50:06.896 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And I actually would love
you all to stand up as well.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Stand up.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.550 align:middle line:90%
It's more fun if you do it.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's more
fun if you stand up.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.919 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to
communicate with us on Facebook

00:50:13.919 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and Twitter and give
us your comments

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and tell us how you feel
after this and during it.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: By the way,
communicating with Gaiam,

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.975 align:middle line:84%
but also on Facebook I am
Jean Houston page official.

00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Not Jean Houston.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Jean Houston page official.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:90%
As well.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So let Jean know how
you feel as well.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.762 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Now what I'm going to
do is every time I say jump,

00:50:32.762 --> 00:50:34.220 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
jump because that's

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the next stage of-- the
next movement in evolution.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I'm ready.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:40.995 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: The first jump--

00:50:40.995 --> 00:50:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Jump!

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: -was the big bang,
an explosion of light

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and in sound so
intense that whatever

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was before or from
some otherwhere

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:84%
imploded itself into a
tiny charge of hydrogen

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and jumped into universal form.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Then some five billion
years ago, a supernova

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:59.830 align:middle line:84%
reached jump time, and with an
unimaginably fierce explosion,

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:02.710 align:middle line:84%
offered itself to the universe
in billions of pieces.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Another jump came for us
when the elements spun out

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of the explosion,
coalesced into a ball that

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.120 align:middle line:84%
condensed into our
mother, our molten planet.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Many jumps of cooling, crusting,
boiling, steaming, raining.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Seas form, the crust roils,
land masses jump and shift,

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.470 align:middle line:84%
break off and crawl over each
other, pulverizing everything

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:22.550 align:middle line:90%
in their wake.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Meteors whiz by, jumping,
raising blinding dust storms,

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or carom into the Earth's crust,
tossing it to pieces sky high.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a set up for the
biggest jump of all.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Life.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Lightning spikes the Earth.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Molecules jump, break
apart, recombine,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.750 align:middle line:84%
jumping through change
after chemical change.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.290 align:middle line:84%
At the edges of the rock
in the shallow waters,

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.070 align:middle line:90%
the feast of life begins.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Giant proteins play
with RNA and DNA.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Some jump to form enzymes,
which hurry everything along.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Nucleic acids hold
the information

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:84%
