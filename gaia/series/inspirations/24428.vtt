00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.600 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live
from the Gaiam studios

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And since it's a live
interactive show,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
I encourage you to
communicate with us

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:10%
through Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:10%
Many of you already are.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:10%
So keep the comments
and questions

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
coming throughout the show.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:10%
According to my guests
today, visionary

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:10%
futurist Barbara Marx
Hubbard, we're facing

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
a historic turning point.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We're evolving from
an unconscious chance

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
to conscious choice.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We're entering into what
Barbara calls the First

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Age of Conscious Evolution.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
However, in order for
something new to start,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
quite often something
old needs to fall apart.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.135 align:middle line:84%
And this is something many
people are experiencing today.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the greatest ways
to move through this shift

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is to start a new conversation,
to move humanity from one

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:90%
phase of evolution to the next.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Barbara has authored
seven acclaimed books

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that communicate a new world
view of conscious evolution.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And she's joining us
here today to share

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:90%
her massive inspiration.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, to the show.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm really happy to be he.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It is our true honor.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful
that you're here.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So talk to us about this
critical tipping point.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You talk about facing either
extinction or evolution.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's obvious we
can't keep over growing

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
in a finite planet.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:10%
And our crisis is literally
an evolutionary driver

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:10%
toward either destruction
of our environment

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:10%
or an evolution of our species.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:10%
And I believe conscious
evolution is becoming conscious

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:10%
that we can affect
our own future

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:10%
and then acting by
choice positively.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So conscious evolution,
what specifically

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is-- break that down for
me, conscious evolution.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:90%
We are aware of evolution.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
We can look back and see
billions of years that it took.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:90%
We are aware.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
We are affecting our own
evolution by everything we do,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the babies we have, the food
we eat, the cars we drive.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
We're also aware
that our behavior

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
could destroy our civilization
and our environment.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So conscious evolution is
saying I'm willing to be aware

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that this is a design
that I could help create,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that my thoughts, my
actions, my choices

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
are going to make the
difference for this world.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Which they are.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you started
off as a homemaker.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're now a
visionary futurist.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:90%
What was your journey like?

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really
started for me in 1945

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
when the United States dropped
the first bombs on Japan.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I was 15 years old in 1945.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought everything
was going for the good.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I saw that we
could misuse that great power

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and destroy our species.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So I asked a question,
what's the meaning

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
of the new power--
science, technology,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:90%
industry-- that's good?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Were you raised with a kind
of an idealistic point of view?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:90%
No, my father was a toymaker.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It was materialistic, secular,
competitive New York business.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Interesting,
interesting.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: How
he got me, I don't know.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Well you arose
from that lifestyle,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
from that upbringing,
to being someone

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
who holds answer questions,
very, very strong questions.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And you follow them through.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You had an incident
where you, I guess,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you wound up in the Oval Office
because of your father, right?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was that
sense of hope that I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
got from that
entrepreneurial spirit.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And my father once gave
a toy train to a general

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in the Air Force, got to
know all the generals.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And they became godfathers
of my half brothers.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So one day in 1952, I was
invited to the Oval Office

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.407 align:middle line:84%
just to say hello to
President Eisenhower.

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, my
goodness, you found

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
yourself with a lot
of different generals

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.654 align:middle line:90%
and in an incredible place.

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
So Eisenhower would

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:90%
just say, hello, young lady.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a courtesy call.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Mr. President,
I have a question for you.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, what is it?

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the
meaning of our new power

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of science, technology, industry
in the military that's good?

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:90%
You asked him that?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And he stared at me and
shook his head and he said,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
we better find out.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
president at the time

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
what is the meaning of
all of our new power

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't know.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.723 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
He had no idea.

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:90%
He hadn't thought of it.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to research,
science, and philosophy,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and religion, and
academic world,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I found we did not have
any vision of our future

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that we want to work
toward equal to our power

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to destroy or create.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.301 align:middle line:84%
So you started to follow
this question through it,

00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:06.455 align:middle line:84%
didn't you?
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: I did.

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And where did that lead you?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
Well, it lead me right here

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
to the awareness that
the crisis we're facing

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is potentially the
birth of what I'm

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:90%
calling a co-creative humanity.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It would be a humanity in which
each person is free to express

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that creativity, to give their
gift to the larger world,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to realize potential,
and to connect

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
to create a better world.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the meaning of our power.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so then you wound
up going to NASA.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You wound up going
to different places.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Your theme, your through line
has been this exact same thing

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to really affect
evolution, to make

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
a huge difference with our
conversation, isn't it?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I started
to ask these questions

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
there was no discipline, no
field, no subject at Bryn

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Mawr College, where I went.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So eventually I became
what's called a futurist.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What did
you study in college?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: I
studied political science

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know what
my deeper purpose was.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But you
learned the current story.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.449 align:middle line:90%
You learned--

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot about
the current story.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I went to Paris my junior year.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I met my husband in a little
cafe on the left bank.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him my
question, what's

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of our new power?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it is?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm an artist.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeking a new
story, a new image

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
commensurate with our power.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
going to marry you.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: And you did.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I got married on the quest
for what is the story,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
what is the direction, and
how are we going to find it?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in a way,
it's an art form because it's

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
not written down somewhere.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
We have to seek it out.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked you
the question of how

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
did you go from being a
homemaker to a futurist,

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:90%
you always have been a futurist.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I got married.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And my husband was an artist.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And Of course, I
had five children.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
In the meantime, that happened.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
From the 1951 to about
1970, I was a full-time mom.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of lost the question.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You were
doing something else.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I was having babies.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And every baby was yet
another wonderful being.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So the question would
deepen with each child,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because if you didn't
know the direction

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
of the future for
yourself, how could you

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
really educate your children?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was before
we really got

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
this sense that the
future was negative

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and might be very much worse.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But even then, I could see
I wanted my children to know

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that there was something for
them to do that was important,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
that was great.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, so as you
were raising your children,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.941 align:middle line:84%
you continued this conversation
going throughout your child

00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
rearing years.
-I did.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that I had, let's

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
say, a calling, a
vocation to tell

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:90%
the story of this larger birth.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
When I told my children
that their mom had

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to go tell this story
of the positive future,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
my nine-year-old
son said to me, mom,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
you're doing what
mothers should.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
You're helping to
create a better

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:90%
future for your children.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, my goodness.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: And
I know that you love us.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So I was a mom that
shifted from full-time mom

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
to what I would call
evolutionary woman.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But I brought all
my children with me.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason I love
the nine-year-old so much,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
because my nine-year-old
son, in a way,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.214 align:middle line:84%
made me realize it was
good for the children.

00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
See, this is a great question,
because it's actually lighting

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:84%
up-- people on Facebook,
they're saying,

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
from running from
doing paying the bills

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and going to the soccer games,
how do I get my children

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation?

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Enrolled in this conversation?

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how you do it.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The children innately
have a sense of the future

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
now much more than in the
'70s, because obviously

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:90%
they're watching TV.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.511 align:middle line:90%
They're on their iPads.

00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Much more
connected, of course.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Those children at
nine now, many of them

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
know more than the older
ones, because they're

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:90%
in the new world.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're connected to
the world nervous system,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:90%
which is internet.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They're connected now.
-Amazing.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So then you had this
incredible vision.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
You went to go buy a
space shuttle, didn't you?

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
Well, that's not quite--

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
what happened was during
the American Apollo program,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:84%
when I saw those rockets go
off, I had this deep sense

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that it was like the fish
coming out of the sea

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:90%
onto the dry land.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Our species was
leaving its biosphere.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to
land on a new world.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately saw that
our future is going to be new

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and that our new technologies,
like the space program,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
were part of a
species that was going

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
to be actually a solar
system species and eventually

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:90%
a galactic species.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And I became so
interested in this

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that I founded the Committee
for the Future in Washington DC.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I started to bring together
futurists from every field,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
from health, from education,
from economics, to say

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.231 align:middle line:90%
what is the positive future.

00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: At what year
was this that you started--

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:90%
1970.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, you started
to have these conversations.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And a filmmaker,
actually, came to us

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
when we were just
founding the Future,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the Committee for the Future.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why
don't you sponsor

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
a citizen-sponsored
space mission to the moon

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and bring back lunar
materials and involve

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
the people of the world
in exploring a new world?

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a good idea that
the Committee for the Future

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:90%
said, all right.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And we had astronauts
who said yes.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I went to Cartier and I
said, what would you pay

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:90%
for 400 pounds of moon rock?

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:90%
They said $400 million.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So we had enough money to
actually rent a rocket soon.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is an
unbelievable story.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
So we went to NASA

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and asked Wernher von
Braun if the people

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:90%
could rent a Saturn V rocket.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And he was totally stunned.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
don't see why not.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So he took me into
the place where

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
they had these great symbols
of the lift of humanity.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And I took out my lipstick
and I wrote on one of them,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.581 align:middle line:90%
"The People's Rocket."

00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:37.054 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:11:37.054 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had a picture of that.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Eventually NASA wouldn't
let us do it because they

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:90%
said it wasn't scientific.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we were going
to do a little experiment

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:90%
on what would grow on the moon.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We called it Project
Harvest Moon.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So with that, I became
truly a pioneering woman.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.795 align:middle line:84%
Well, absolutely I would
say so in an entrepreneur

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
at heart because you were able
to broker this whole deal.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: I'm
known as one of the first space

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:90%
entrepreneurs.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It's too funny.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I appreciate you
sharing your story with us,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
because these are stories that
make such a big difference.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you wound
up running as a vice

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.957 align:middle line:90%
presidential candidate in 1984.

00:12:19.957 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:90%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: I did.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:10%
And I want to tell you when
I realized that our story was

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:10%
part of the universe story--
I call it a crisis of birth

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:10%
of a co-creative,
co-evolving humanity--

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:10%
everything I did was about
how to tell the bigger story.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So actually the Saturn
V rocket was in order

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to tell the story that
we're going to be able to be

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:90%
a solar system species.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Running for vice president
was not because I was going

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to be a full time politician.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But Buckminster Fuller,
he made the geodesic dome.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, space ship Earth came
without an operating manual.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, women
should go into politics to

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:90%
present options for the future.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara, you should
run for president.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so he was the
influence behind this.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I decided to do what in
America is very typical,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:90%
an idea candidacy.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I called it "Campaign
for a Positive Future."

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had a great idea that the
vice president should create

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
a new function to map, track,
and connect, and communicate

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
what's working in America.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: In 1984.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I want around the country.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Positive Future Centers formed.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Democratic
National Convention

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
with no money, no media,
and no passes to the floor.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I got into the governor's wife
of Colorado-- interesting.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I went to these early
morning caucuses and said,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm Barbara Hubbard.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm running for vice
president to find

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:90%
out what works in America.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I got over 200 delegates,
more than anybody else,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
except Geraldine Ferraro, and I
was the other woman nominated.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say the importance
here is if you have a vision,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
like I had a vision
that our crisis is

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:90%
the birth of something new.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed with it every
step of the way, whether it be

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
the NASA rockets or
running for vice president

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
or what I'm doing now, I ask
all visionaries, stay with it.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And do the work.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you got into the field.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:90%
You explored.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:90%
You asked the questions.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You were ferociously curious.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.074 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop.

00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
I don't stop.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that you
demonstrate the reality of what

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:90%
your vision.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
conscious evolution.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.950 align:middle line:90%
You and I are evolution.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:90%
We are the universe in person.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
That give me chills
when you say that.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
The universe always wants
more consciousness, more life.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You can see from the billions
of years of evolution.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.042 align:middle line:84%
So when you and I or
any of the listeners

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
want more expression
of their own vision,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that's the universe wanting it.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just your own
little private story.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We have footage of the speech
that Barbara gave at the 1984

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Democratic National Convention.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It is a very similar
story to today.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.781 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.781 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
The theme of my campaign is to
fulfill the dream, a campaign

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:90%
for a positive future.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1776, our forbearers freed
the individual from the tyranny

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:90%
of the divine right of kings.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They stated the
self-evident truth

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that all men are
created equal when there

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:90%
was no equality in the world.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
There were kings and subjects,
classes and races, sexism.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Yet the power of the word
of truth changed the world.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
In 1984, we face a tyranny
far greater than King George.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeking a
freedom even greater

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:90%
than that of the individual.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
The tyranny we face is the
threat of the extinction

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And the freedom we seek
is the emancipation

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:10%
of the genius of the
human race to fulfill

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:10%
our highest potential.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:10%
In 1984, we must state
the new self-evident truth

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:10%
from the point of power of
the American presidency.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:10%
And the power of this word will
transform the world once again.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:10%
The new truth is that
we are one planet.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:90%
We are one peoples of the Earth.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And we will live and die
together for evermore.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It is now in our capacity to
destroy civilization as we know

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
it, or to build a world of
unprecedented opportunity

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.058 align:middle line:90%
for all people.

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel watching
that conversation

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
20 some odd years ago?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
I feel grateful that I said
yes to that impulse inside me

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:90%
to tell the grader story.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And now when I see it,
I realize I was right.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Absolutely,
it's the same conversation

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:90%
that we are having now.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the same conversation
that people sit in that chair

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and say the same thing
you were saying in 1984.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: So
the real story for anybody

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
is when you say yes
to the impulse in you

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.554 align:middle line:84%
to express that that yes
is conscious evolution.

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's beautiful.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean what you have created
and throughout your story,

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I see the evolution of where you
have come and where we are now.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
conversation you were having

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
in that video on that pulpit.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
creating a new humanity.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I also need to know why are we
having this same conversation

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:90%
28 years later.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that the
crisis of overpopulation,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
pollution, destruction of the
environment has increased.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And now we are aware
of global warming.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We are aware of
financial difficulties.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:90%
We are aware of terrorism.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So all of those
awarenesses is in the news

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
constantly telling people
that things aren't working.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the need to know what
is working and what is emerging

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
is greater than ever before.
-It is.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But then what are some
of-- I mean, we know this.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:90%
We have this awareness.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.670 align:middle line:90%
But what are the answers?

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:90%
What are the steps?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:90%
What are the solutions?

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the way
we're going to know

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is by identifying
what's working.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
New health care, what
Gaiam is doing in health.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
All of these things, what
are new spirituality is.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Where we're bringing the
inner essence of spirit

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:90%
in every one of us.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
What are the new
economics where we're

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
looking for
alternative currencies

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and economic democracy?

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
What are the new
possibilities in governance,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%
of co-operative management?

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
for innovations--

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as a wheel
of co-creation-- in all

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
the organic
functions, you'll find

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
there's enough that's working
if it were known and connected.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we need
to do in 2012 and beyond

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is start a global
communication of what's

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:90%
working and connected.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what I ran
for vice president for.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are a lot of
conversations happening.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of small hubs of
conversations and organizations

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that are having
this conversation.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see that
they are connected.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:90%
They're not connected.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
considered the new news.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I am calling for a new
interpretation of the news--

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
not what's breaking
down, but what's

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
breaking through, in
such a way that you

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
see it's a whole system.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we have a
whole system breaking

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.381 align:middle line:84%
down in environment, in
economics, in health,

00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and so forth--
-We hear a lot about that, yes.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole system
breaking through.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what
isn't known, even

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
though we might know separate
things that might be working.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So what
is it specifically?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:90%
What's breaking through?

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
What is the good news?

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:10%
I would say the good news
is that we are being born

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:10%
as a co-evolutionary,
co-creative species in which

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:10%
every single person
actually has a creative gift

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:10%
that as we say yes
to that, we can

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:10%
evolve ourselves personally.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:10%
We can evolve the world.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect,
I believe we

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
have the technology and
resources to make a world

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:90%
that works for everyone.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I think we can explore
our solar system.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we can evolve
our spirituality.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we probably will find
we're in a universe filled

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
with life, and
that our crisis is

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the birth not only of
a co-created species

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:90%
but of a universal humanity.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at little planet
Earth, like the astronauts did,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
you'll see it's a living system.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
The astronaut saw the
geographical Earth.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing now the people,
the systems, and the connecting

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of the thinking layer through
Facebook, Twitter, Gaiam

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
TV, such that here's my vision.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
That there's enough input
into that collective nervous

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
communication system,
like the nervous system

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:90%
of a newborn baby.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know it's been born.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
It needs its mother's love.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It goes against the loving
heart of the mother.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It hears that heartbeat.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And its nervous system links up.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It opens its eyes and smiles.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I see that this nervous
system, now filled

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
with so many inspirations,
so many projects that work,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
if we have it as the new
news, which I want to do--

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that's my mission now is to
tell the new news of our birth

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
as a universal
species and invite

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
everybody who has
something that's

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:90%
working to tell their story.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So as I said earlier, that
the way out of this the shift

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and the pain that people maybe
are experiencing right now

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is this a new evolution
and that we're

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
in the first phase of this.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Now you would think where we
are in evolution right now,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be in a
first phase of anything.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:90%
But you're saying that we are.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're the first phase of
a species that could destroy

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
its own environment
and knows it,

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and that could evolve its
own, not only environment,

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
personal, social,
technological, such

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that we could
transcend what we've

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
known as the human existence.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:84%
We have gained powers we
used to attribute to gods.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So I feel symbolically
that we have

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that the
design of creation

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
is to create people who are
co-creators with the process

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:90%
We're meant to have this power.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But it won't be guided from
the existing structures

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of global corporations,
existing organized religions,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
top down structures.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Who is it going to be guided by?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The people who are
connecting like you and me.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
We're not the head
of a nation state.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not the head of
a global corporation.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:90%
We're the people.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Who is listening to this?

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:90%
The people.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Those are the ones.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:90%
We have the internet.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And Birth 2012, December 22,
2012 is being designed as a day

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:90%
to celebrate what's working.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So December 22, that the
day after the alleged date

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of December 21, Birth 2012,
what do you mean by that?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is that it's
time to celebrate everything

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that can that we feel is working
toward a more positive future.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a time on a planetary scale
to connect through the heart.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
We're calling it
Heart Coherence.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is said that if 350,000
people simultaneously felt love

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
in their heart for each
other and for all species

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and for the planet--

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:90%
At the same time?

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
it would shift

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:90%
that consciousness of Earth.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And for me Birth 2012, and
beyond-- but just take it

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
as a marker-- is a time to
connect through the heart,

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate what works, and
to have a shared intention

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of a consciousness shift
on planet Earth in time

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
to save us from
more destruction.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So this conversation is
obviously already happening.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:90%
This is happening now.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
It'll happen beyond
the December date.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
is in play right

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
now, this new conversation.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
The new conversation
is in play.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But because the mass
media and the news system

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and the existing
political system

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
doesn't pick up the
news of what's emerging.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, it
shows that there's

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:90%
more opposing forces than ever.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think that
it's become even more apparent

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that the news and
the devastation

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
is getting louder as this
conversation gets louder?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
In some respects, the
purpose of getting all of that

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:90%
break down news is to awaken.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
careful not to become

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
so disappointed or
fearful that we don't

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:90%
listen to that inner impulse.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I have
learned personally

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
from being a mother of five
and going through all of this

00:25:54.020 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
is when you have what I call
vocational arousal, when

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
something excites you to
express, instead of saying,

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't think
I'm good enough,

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:84%
say, yes, knowing it's the
impulse of evolution in you.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And when anyone, but
particularly a woman,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.924 align:middle line:84%
says yes to that impulse,
as she gets older, 50, 60,

00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
70-- I'm 82-- when she
gets older and says,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
yes, instead of aging and losing
vitality, what's happening

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
is we're awakening to more
creativity and so are the men.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer needing to
be in a dominator position,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:84%
men start tuning in to their
essence, to their creativity.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's the new partnership.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the new partnership.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:90%
This is conscious evolution.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
This is what it means to
be an evolutionary human.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.474 align:middle line:84%
and be right back with
Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:26:58.474 --> 00:27:01.883 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:01.883 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is visionary
futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
creating a new worldview

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of conscious evolution.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'm really
sensitive to is making sure

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that this conversation
applies to everyone,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is a practical conversation,
and as big and as large

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
as the conversation
can be, and is

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.046 align:middle line:84%
necessary about
conscious evolution and

00:27:40.046 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:90%
our whole evolutionary story.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out how it
relates to people when they're

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:84%
hitting massive
depression or where

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
they're lost about a purpose in
life or financial devastation.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
How does that apply?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, I just like
to tell you what

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:10%
happened to me, because
when I had up to about

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:10%
my fourth child, I was OK.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:10%
This is 1951.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:10%
And it was the era of the
woman who you get married,

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:10%
you have babies, you take care
of your house and your husband.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And I did it with great
joy, actually, until I

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:10%
started to get depressed.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
in the late '50s,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the depression was
considered neurotic.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And I went to a psychiatrist.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you're
obviously what's wrong.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Then I read Betty Friedan.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that
thousands of women

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.950 align:middle line:90%
had something-- what was it?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It was a loss of identity.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we were wife and mother.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:90%
But there was more.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And then I read Abraham Maslow.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, every
joyful, creative person

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
has one thing in
common-- something

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that they feel called to do,
life purpose, chosen vocation.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
That when they do it, they're
self-rewarded and of service.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to look
for a life purpose

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:90%
that would include my children.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:90%
But I was only 29 or 30.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being at the
end, I was at the beginning.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I took the depression
as a signaled something more

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.877 align:middle line:90%
to be expressed.

00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So where
did you start?

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Where did you start looking
for that bigger conversation?

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
I started to look

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because of a reading
Abraham Maslow--

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:90%
anything that attracted me.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to
do in my reading,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I was attracted to,
actually, Abraham Maslow.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did
is I called him

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:90%
up and invited him for lunch.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Himself?

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Himself.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.650 align:middle line:84%
What's the hierarchy
of needs mean?

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:40.720 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:90%
See this is what-- I was bold.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you get this depression,
you have to ask yourself,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
what glimmer of
something attracts you?

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
It could be an organization.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It could be a book.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be some
kind of activity.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
You start to move toward it.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:90%
And that takes courage.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What did
Abraham Maslow say to you?

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX
HUBBARD: He said yes.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have saved
my life, because I

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:90%
realized I'm not neurotic.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm just an under expressed.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So we had lunch
together in New York.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:90%
And I told him all my problems.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, Barbara,
you represent life.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I will give you the names
of 300 people I've collected

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
over the years-- all of whom
he called the good souls,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:90%
you psychic.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens
if you say yes.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I then decided to write
a letter to 300 people.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
My question was, what do
you think is the next step

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.830 align:middle line:90%
for the future good?

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So after Maslow
gave me these names,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a letter to them.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the next
step for the future good?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.912 align:middle line:84%
People like Thomas Merton
and Jonas Salk and others.

00:31:03.912 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And some of the wrote back.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And I then called them up.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So my path was to take
depression as a signal

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and look for life purpose.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think as you get
beyond your very early years,

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of
that impulse in you,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.160 align:middle line:90%
that's your own creativity.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:90%
So you say yes to it.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is one
of the questions

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.370 align:middle line:90%
coming in from Facebook.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Is Diana is saying,
where do I find my yes?

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You actually go within and
feel what attracts you to give.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not the secret of
what you want to get.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the secret of
what you want to give.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
That is so important,
so important.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The gift of giving out of your
creativity is what grows you.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Is that
what a future human?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:90%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: Yes.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
say yes to giving,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
what your creativity
is, the more

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:90%
you are nourished by giving it.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the way the design is.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I consider it the next
step after having babies.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the identifying
of the gift,

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
the feminine, whose

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:90%
body is able to create a baby--

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It's another kind of birth.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
She's able to give
birth to that authentic,

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.160 align:middle line:90%
creative, feminine self.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's interesting,
because when we met today,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I said, how are you?

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And we've been really
sensitive to the conversation

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
of answering that
with crazy busy,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.980 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to
identify with that any longer.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.625 align:middle line:84%
But the minute I got in the
car and said, how are you?

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:84%
You turned to me and
you said, engaged.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I've discovered, Lisa,
is that when you're engaged

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're older,
the energy in you

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:84%
starts to be
activated by this yes.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've coined a new word
for women over 50 who say yes.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It's regenopause.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You have menopause,
no more eggs.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Then you are the egg.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:90%
You are giving birth.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you say yes, the
yes seems to open up.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't close down
when you get older.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:90%
What a great story.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way you came
from with just asking

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the right questions and you
have really no fear in going

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to people and saying,
here's my question

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and will you answer it.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And you follow through
and follow through.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing story of you
went to NASA and asked that.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Now you fast forward
to now, here,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:84%
where you're sitting here as
a visionary futurists, who

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
has held the space for us
for so long about a conscious

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:84%
evolution and spoken about
it in many, many platforms

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- there's
actually a clip that we have

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:90%
here that I want you to see.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's from a movie that you
created called "Vision."

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And the production company is
called Quantum Productions.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.262 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:34:05.262 --> 00:34:08.494 align:middle line:90%

BARBARA MARX
HUBBARD (VOICEOVER):

00:34:20.947 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:84%
One day I was taking a walk
in the hills above my home.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing a lot of
reading about the great mystics

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual teachers of
the past in relationship

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
to a positive
future for humanity.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't quite bring
all of my thoughts together.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Frustrated, I suddenly
stopped and posed

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:90%
a question to the universe.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:52.444 align:middle line:90%
What is humanity's new story?

00:34:52.444 --> 00:34:53.837 align:middle line:90%
The universe responded.

00:34:53.837 --> 00:34:56.561 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.561 --> 00:35:00.959 align:middle line:84%
I had an expanded
reality experience.

00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:04.052 align:middle line:84%
I pierced the blue
cocoon of Earth

00:35:04.052 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:84%
as our astronauts had
done and found myself

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:90%
floating weightlessly in space.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I had become a universal
being, capable of seeing

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.866 align:middle line:84%
and comprehending
humanity's role

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:90%
within the entire cosmic story.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
In a flash, I was
catapulted into the future.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And I could see a few frames
ahead of the movie of creation.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of myself as
a member of planet Earth.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.597 align:middle line:84%
I saw that we were
running out of energy

00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and gasping for breath.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the pain running
through the whole planetary

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:54.564 align:middle line:84%
This shared feeling of
pain opened our hearts.

00:35:54.564 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Love poured through
our nervous systems.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:03.738 align:middle line:84%
We experienced mass
moments, a higher

00:36:03.738 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:90%
harmonic of consciousness.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.265 align:middle line:90%
The airs cleared.

00:36:09.265 --> 00:36:13.118 align:middle line:84%
The waters became
pristine again.

00:36:13.118 --> 00:36:17.976 align:middle line:84%
As the mass resonance increase,
the systems of our social body

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:22.440 align:middle line:84%
seemed to join together
as never before.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.912 align:middle line:10%
I felt every basic
social system shift

00:36:25.912 --> 00:36:31.864 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously as innovations
and breakthroughs connected.

00:36:31.864 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Systems of health and education,
economics and environment

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:84%
began to coalesce
seamlessly by the same power

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that orchestrated the
creation of the universe.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:90%
We were be coordinated.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I heard the
words, our story

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:90%
is the birth of new humanity.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.808 align:middle line:84%
We are all members
of one, living,

00:36:57.808 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
planetary body, the offspring of
a greater cosmic intelligence,

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.782 align:middle line:84%
predestined to explore
the further reaches

00:37:06.782 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:90%
of our infinite universe.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:90%
That was 40 years ago.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And it awoke in me the
impulse to discover

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
how this possibility
might actually be true.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So I began to research what do
we know that makes it possible

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
for us to be
connected as one body,

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to be born towards our
next stage of evolution.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've invited some of the
great visionaries of our time

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that I have found
over these 40 years

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to help us see the truth, the
realistic possibilities of us

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:84%
becoming a co-creative
universal humanity.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Envisions we're going
to piece together

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:90%
the new story, the new vision.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:13.306 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go where
humans have never gone before.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're doing today

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:84%
absolutely is creating
these conversations.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with a
conversation like this

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and then spark so many
different conversations.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So in your book, "The
Birth 2012" book,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.230 align:middle line:84%
you talk about tools,
specific tools for becoming

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.780 align:middle line:90%
an evolutionary human.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:90%
What are some of those?

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say you get
turned on by the big yes.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And you are still the soccer
mom or you're in a job

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:90%
that you may not like so much.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, the first thing is
you say yes to that attraction

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and you reach out.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But as you start finding
what attracts you,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.110 align:middle line:84%
there are some really
important practices.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is really
the practice of HeartMath.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have just
taught the simplest thing

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of putting your
hand over your heart

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of what you
appreciate, feeling it.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first practice is
feeling love and appreciation.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
makes your nervous system

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:84%
from your heart intelligence and
your brain intelligence to be

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:90%
related and you get wiser.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And you get to be
attracted to others.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:90%
HeartMath.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
The second practice,
we're calling

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
the shift from your egoic, local
self-identity to your essence.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Your essence is
your true nature.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the spirit within.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And in my own case,
Lisa, I always

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.040 align:middle line:84%
projected that essence
onto a higher self and then

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to the Christ.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote in my journal.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote about that
I felt so good, so whole.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But then I'd go
out to do it, and I

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't stay with that feeling
of wholeness and peace.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:90%
So it wouldn't work?

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.480 align:middle line:90%
So it wouldn't work.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I recommend.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Take some morning time.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And put your attention,
whatever and however

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
it happens for you, on the
higher experience of spirit

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
your attention on it,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:24.700 align:middle line:84%
the spirit starts to
come into your own heart

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and it activates
your own creativity.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And the poor little local self,
who's out there making things

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
work and earning a living
and getting things done,

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:84%
starts to come in to
this inner sanctuary.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And the practice is to
stay in the experience

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:84%
of your own true
nature long enough

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:84%
for the local self to fall
in love with its own essence.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Is that how you
create the miracles

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:90%
that you create in your life?

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that how you do
manifesting things?

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
What I'm really saying is
to become a universal human,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:84%
as part of this
universal humanity,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:84%
you need to shift
into your heart,

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and to then feel your own
essence, your own spirituality

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And I call this the birth
of the universal human.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're an infant,
you forget all the time.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But in your morning
meditation, just remember it,

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
bring local self in.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually
you're a child.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to
see that self in others.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But then when you go out
and you confront others

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.840 align:middle line:84%
who don't have that same energy,
and who have maybe and more

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of a negative and
doubting type of presence,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.330 align:middle line:84%
how do you communicate
that message?

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
So the next thing

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
is I really think you need to
find at least one other person,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, two or more are
gathered, in resonance,

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.132 align:middle line:90%
where, like you and I.

00:41:50.132 --> 00:41:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I am resounding.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I can feel your own essence.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:90%
You are feeling my essence.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.000 align:middle line:84%
The resonance between the
two of us allows more of this

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:90%
to come out.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Then let's say we
had to go to a place

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:90%
where there was no resonance.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
We could at least
return to this.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.016 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
And I say to people

00:42:10.016 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:90%
don't try to do this all alone.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
actually a great point.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: Reach out
to at least one other person.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
the book "Birth 2012,"

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:90%
there's a whole website--

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Of organizations that
you can reach out to

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Birth2012.com,
can reach out to.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.574 align:middle line:84%
And we're recommending that
people form small circles.

00:42:29.574 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:90%
That's a great way to start.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So two or more, you
can form a circle.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you meet like once a
week or once every two weeks,

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:84%
you can put your
name on the website

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and you will meet other
people who are forming

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.700 align:middle line:90%
circles around the world.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.340 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, that's great.
That's great.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
And we have conference

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:90%
calls for all the circles.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And what happens is--

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way to
connect it all together.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.510 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But what it does take to
become this kind of human,

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I call it a pioneering soul.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Think of the pioneers that
came over in the covered

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
wagons in the United
States of America,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:90%
there was nobody to help them.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.840 align:middle line:90%
But they had courage.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in a time where
we need social pioneering.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to be
spiritual pioneers.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not that somebody is
going to just drop down

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:90%
and help all of this happen.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to do it?

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Is this the social synergy that
you talk about in your book?

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
that yes, that courage

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:84%
through the heart, that finding
each other, that joining

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the websites of all these other
people-- and Birth2012.com

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:45.170 align:middle line:84%
is one of many websites like
that-- and then social synergy.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The next step I recommend
to people who form circles

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:84%
is to reach out into
their community for people

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.530 align:middle line:84%
in all these fields like
health, education, economics,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
environment, and
bring them together

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to look for common goals and
match the needs of one group

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:90%
with the resources of the other.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Like a communications
media group

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:84%
would join with an
education group would join

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.890 align:middle line:84%
with an environmental
group, because no function,

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:18.380 align:middle line:84%
like health or education or
economics, can do it alone.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
No project all on
its own can do it.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great point right.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So joining two or more,
connect with others,

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:84%
find out what attracts
you, say yes, go for it.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.680 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is the
formula right here.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.030 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: This is the
formula for becoming

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:90%
an evolutionary human.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.430 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: And
when you say yes enough,

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:90%
you'll find it for sure others.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Absolutely.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be courageous
enough to say how you feel.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're in a workplace
where people don't seem to get

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it, if you say
something like, I just

00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
feel like there's something more
that wants to happen for me.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:84%
If you say it without
criticizing others,

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:90%
you know what will happen?

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
For sure there is somebody
else who feels this way.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:12.144 align:middle line:84%
And you are going to become what
I call an evolutionary leader.

00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:13.810 align:middle line:84%
This is really a light
up the people on Facebook.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
One of our listeners is saying
that their workplace, they

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.591 align:middle line:84%
find that people are-- it's
not a professional conversation

00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:20.290 align:middle line:90%
to have.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're considered
to "woo woo"

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:84%
if they have this conversation
in their work environment.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.470 align:middle line:84%
How did they find people
who are like minded

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
in their work environment?

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:37.450 align:middle line:84%
What I say about that is you
learn to be able to communicate

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.710 align:middle line:90%
without disarranging everybody.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't get up
and make a speech.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.720 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So you don't run your
agenda through every one else.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't.
You say how you feel.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:84%
You ask if anybody
else feels this.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:90%
You become attractive.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
become attractive

00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.514 align:middle line:84%
is if you're attracted
to something inside you.

00:46:00.514 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You can be sure that others
want to feel that way.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:05.690 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That is true.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is the quickest way
to get out of a depression

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:84%
or current situation that is
even painful and devastating

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is to chunk up like this.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about the
workplace, some of the best

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.730 align:middle line:84%
pioneers in this are
consultants in business,

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like Otto Sharma
with the U Theory.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
He'll take business,
corporate leaders.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And they get together.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they go down this
U into a deeper space.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they get in touch
with their own essence.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And they start
meeting each other

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.340 align:middle line:90%
in a sacred and safe space.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Then they go up
the U. And they're

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.940 align:middle line:84%
in the business environment
again, but they've changed.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So you've created various
hubs around the globe that are

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation already.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is I'm
always now in this conversation

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.600 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
fortunate enough to say yes

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to my own personal
vocation, to find others,

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and to find the
time on the planet

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:84%
is awakening millions of us to
realize just more of the same

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.160 align:middle line:90%
will not work.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.140 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What do
you find challenging

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.620 align:middle line:90%
about spreading this word?

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get
confrontation around this?

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
well, I don't think

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.970 align:middle line:90%
it will make any difference.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Or things have gone too far,
and what makes you think you

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:90%
can possibly make a difference?

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And it won't work.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And what
do you say to that?

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I say that the only thing
that can make a difference

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.880 align:middle line:84%
is you and I and
all of us saying,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.250 align:middle line:90%
yes, we're going to do our best.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And having other people
in this conversation.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And joining and reaching out.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm suggesting
everyone have the courage

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:90%
to be yes and share it.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And you learn how
to communicate.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.700 align:middle line:84%
You know when I first
started to communicate this.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I used to be
completely repulsive.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I said too much, too fast.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And nobody wanted to hear it.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:90%
So I got the feedback.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Try to be a little
bit more engaging.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So you learned,
very interesting.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.890 align:middle line:84%
You are now still in the
political arena, aren't you?

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.190 align:middle line:84%
With the conversations
that you're

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.941 align:middle line:84%
having behind the scenes, more
so with our leaders right now,

00:48:16.941 --> 00:48:17.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm having as many
conversations as I can.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I did meet with
Vice President Joe Biden.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
about all the crises.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mr. Vice president,
I have a suggestion for you.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:90%
What's that? he says.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.410 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Here
comes Barbara again.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, why don't you try
to find out what's working

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.360 align:middle line:90%
in America and communicate it.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is Joe Biden.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:90%
His face lit up.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And he started to talk
about what's working.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said an
interesting thing.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The president cannot
look optimistic,

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.970 align:middle line:84%
because he would be criticized
for not understanding

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.600 align:middle line:90%
the pain of others.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But the vice
president could do it.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is just one out of
many things that I'm doing.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But basically, we have a
welcoming committee in here,

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:84%
people like Jack Canfield, Neale
Donald Walsch, Jean Houston,

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Lynn McTaggart, Lynn Twist.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We are identifying
leaders of the new world.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much leaders
of the old world.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:25.211 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're holding the
fort for the new to show up.

00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:25.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.076 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
I don't think

00:49:27.076 --> 00:49:28.980 align:middle line:84%
you can do it at the
top of the pyramid,

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.830 align:middle line:90%
like in the presidency.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Like
it's being done now.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Or the head of an
organized religion.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because it's a pyramid
structure, which is top down.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.510 align:middle line:90%
It's designed that way.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And it built civilization.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.790 align:middle line:90%
But it can't evolve it.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're going into
a more holistic,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:84%
not only personal health,
but social holistic

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.230 align:middle line:90%
planetary holism.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
you said personal health,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because there is a health
care crisis in America.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many different
levels that you could look at.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of crisis,
and I know that you speak

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.090 align:middle line:84%
to these leaders on a
regular basis, which I think

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.970 align:middle line:84%
is fantastic that they're
having conversations

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:84%
with you, our current
political leaders,

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.080 align:middle line:84%
about conscious evolution.
-They are.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
it's a new movement.

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We had in the 60s
the peace movement,

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.350 align:middle line:84%
the Civil Rights Movement,
the woman's right movement,

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.620 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness movement.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:90%
They all have grown and matured.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:90%
But something new is happening.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.570 align:middle line:84%
At the growing age
of every one of those

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:36.520 align:middle line:84%
is the sense of something
emerging that's new.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's new comes out of the
connection of our creativity.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.090 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:90%
That is what you're doing.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have been honored
with so many different awards.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.980 align:middle line:84%
There is one that I know the
Reverend Michael Beckwith just

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:84%
gave you in terms of
a lifetime achievement

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.890 align:middle line:90%
award, which is so due to you.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I know you're still just
getting started, aren't you?

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I call it that this
regenopause actually

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.490 align:middle line:90%
gives you more vitality.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:10.306 align:middle line:90%
So at 82, I actually feel newer.

00:51:10.306 --> 00:51:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness, what an
inspiration that truly is.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the clip that
we have with Barbara receiving

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:90%
the lifetime achievement award.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.650 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.180 align:middle line:84%
You're so idealistic,
Barbara, look at human nature.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.640 align:middle line:84%
How could you imagine
that we could change?

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:10%
So my answer always
is, could you

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.180 align:middle line:10%
tell me how we got from
subatomic particles to you

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and me now?

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.110 align:middle line:10%
I found that every
time the whole system

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.200 align:middle line:10%
is hit with a crisis that
couldn't be resolved by doing

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.760 align:middle line:10%
more of the same,
there was a jump

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:10%
in consciousness and freedom
through more complex order.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.080 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to put humanity
in the 14 billion year story

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.080 align:middle line:10%
and recognize that it's the
first time in the 14 billion

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:10%
years that any species was
caught in a quantum jump

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.660 align:middle line:10%
and became conscious,
that by their own actions

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.270 align:middle line:10%
they could change it
or destroy themselves.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And if we got from
subatomic particles

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.060 align:middle line:10%
to here through
all these crises,

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:10%
my absolute faith is that it
couldn't turn off with us.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.600 align:middle line:10%
There's absolutely no way that
the force of creation that

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:10%
brought us would turn off just
exactly when the species is

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:28.900 align:middle line:10%
becoming conscious of the
force and of the design

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:33.780 align:middle line:10%
of the process of creation, such
that we can co-create with it.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.210 align:middle line:10%
And in my language,
what's happening on Earth

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:41.560 align:middle line:10%
is that millions of us are
giving birth within ourselves

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.200 align:middle line:10%
to a universal human.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.560 align:middle line:10%
Every person who supra-sexually,
that means your creativity

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:10%
is aroused at the
very same passion

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.170 align:middle line:10%
that we created and
reproduced our species,

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:59.090 align:middle line:10%
we are going to express
that procreative love

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:10%
into a co-creative love.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.070 align:middle line:10%
And every one of
us is imbued with

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.390 align:middle line:10%
a tremendous,
creative expression

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that is yearning to go out.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:10%
It's the time for the
feminine to give birth

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:10%
to the authentic feminine self.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.530 align:middle line:10%
I asked for a word to symbolize
what was happening to me.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And the word I received
was regenopause.

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.720 align:middle line:10%
Because when the feminine
self lives long enough

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.850 align:middle line:10%
to be expressing that divine
feminine in partnership

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:34.870 align:middle line:10%
with men but fully liberated
to go the whole way,

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:38.270 align:middle line:10%
she becomes the missing
link of our species.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:40.900 align:middle line:10%
And we're not going to save this
world by guilt and fear alone.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.760 align:middle line:10%


00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:10%
We're going to save this
world by the passion

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.985 align:middle line:10%
to join our genius to create.

00:53:47.985 --> 00:53:51.627 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.627 --> 00:53:52.570 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That is great.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:54.610 align:middle line:90%
That is great.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I want to applaud.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You're so inspirational.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You represent so
much with your story.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad we
had the opportunity

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to go through your
story with you

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.130 align:middle line:84%
today, which I don't see very
often that you have the time

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to even talk about
because you're

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.350 align:middle line:90%
talking about our next steps.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for joining me today

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.960 align:middle line:84%
for the inspiration that
you are and for all that

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.970 align:middle line:90%
you have served with us.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:22.400 align:middle line:90%
And you're still going.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lisa.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want everyone to
know that their story

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:90%
is part of the big story.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes,
that's a great point.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is needed to
be part of that shift

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.400 align:middle line:84%
toward a planetary evolution.
-Yes.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.705 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you so much.

00:54:39.705 --> 00:54:41.379 align:middle line:84%
