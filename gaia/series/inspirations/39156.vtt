>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:17.384 align:middle line:84%
Are you struggling with what
your dream is, or are you trying

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.654 align:middle line:84%
to figure out exactly how
to make that dream happen?

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.556 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you've been
on a spiritual journey

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.426 align:middle line:84%
for a long time and
you still don't feel

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.294 align:middle line:84%
like you're getting
what you want.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me is Mary
Morrissey, she's the founder

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.435 align:middle line:84%
of Life Solutions and she
helps people reduce the stress

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:38.572 align:middle line:84%
in their lives and turn their
possibilities into realities,

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.641 align:middle line:84%
which I think would actually
reduce a lot of stress.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:41.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Mary Morrissey:
Sure, it does.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So welcome.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Thank you.

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:44.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, tell
me a little bit

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:48.048 align:middle line:84%
about why you think people
don't achieve what they want

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.083 align:middle line:90%
in their lives?

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.885 align:middle line:84%
Like what's the main
reason do you see?

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I think
that deep down,

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.456 align:middle line:84%
many of us have been trained
to have possibility blindness

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:58.259 align:middle line:84%
that we think-- we see
a possibility out there

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.628 align:middle line:84%
but we're blind to the power
that we really have inside

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:05.499 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves to make choices and
create mindsets and take steps

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.034 align:middle line:84%
that literally move us from
this life to this life.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:08.969 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know how to do it.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.237 align:middle line:90%
So we've been trained to think

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.272 align:middle line:84%
when I have the money,
when I have the time.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.074 align:middle line:84%
And we look to circumstances
for permission

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.643 align:middle line:84%
and that creates a
possibility blindness

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:17.044 align:middle line:90%
so we think we can have it.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or, somebody
else can have it

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.549 align:middle line:84%
that is more maybe
deserving, that has more money,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.286 align:middle line:84%
or I've been dealt such a
rough deck in life I can't have

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:26.987 align:middle line:90%
that particularl thing.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:90%
But you're not a stranger

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.924 align:middle line:84%
to being dealt a
rough deck, are you?

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: No, I'm not.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: My gosh, you have
resilience like I've never see.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.829 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
your life a little bit.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:90%
We have some photos here

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.831 align:middle line:84%
that you've shared
with us, thank you.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.134 align:middle line:84%
This photo we're looking
at here is a picture

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:41.168 align:middle line:90%
of your family, right?

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, it is.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.605 align:middle line:84%
That is my older sister on the
left and myself and my parents.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.942 align:middle line:84%
I was born and raised in a
family in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad lived and
loved together for 63 years

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.547 align:middle line:84%
'til my dad passed away, and
had a great upbringing.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:56.417 align:middle line:84%
My sister was eight years
older, went off to college

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:58.552 align:middle line:84%
and my high school
experience was

00:01:58.552 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
like any young girl
dreams about.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.088 align:middle line:90%
I was class vice-president,

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
on the drill team, had
a lead in the junior play,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.225 align:middle line:90%
I'm homecoming princess.

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:06.727 align:middle line:84%
At the end of my junior year
in high school, I get pregnant

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle line:84%
and my high school boyfriend had
gone up to college, came home,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.599 align:middle line:84%
on spring break, I got pregnant
and May 1, I tell my mom

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.633 align:middle line:90%
and dad I'm now pregnant.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.536 align:middle line:84%
My mother wept for
me as if I had died.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my God.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: In her
mind, all her dreams

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:22.776 align:middle line:84%
for me were dying and-- we had a
very hasty 10-person wedding.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:24.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And we have a picture
here of you as a junior, yes?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, that
came after the next step

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:84%
because the next step was
that the principal called me

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:33.053 align:middle line:84%
into his office and said, "Mary,
I understand you're pregnant

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.089 align:middle line:84%
and married and we need to
let you know, you're not going

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to return to here,"
to the high school I've been in.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.662 align:middle line:84%
That picture is the
next high school, Lisa.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:42.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, so you couldn't--

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:43.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: The
next high school--

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:44.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- graduate
from that school?

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: No, they
sent me to a high school

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.102 align:middle line:84%
that had pregnant girls and
delinquent boys and it was an

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:90%
after dark high school.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.574 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very difficult
era where you couldn't--

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.342 align:middle line:84%
I was told I couldn't come
back to the high school I was

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
in because it would
be inappropriate

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.314 align:middle line:84%
for a pregnant girl to get
mixed in with the normal girls.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.384 align:middle line:84%
And so, I want to-- and I
just encourage our listener

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.419 align:middle line:84%
or our viewer to think about
where you were at the beginning

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.122 align:middle line:84%
of your senior year, 'cause
where I was was I'm walking

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:10.024 align:middle line:84%
up to a school with this
Washington High School during

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.293 align:middle line:84%
the day for the normal
kids in Portland, Oregon,

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:84%
and at night it became
Washington Evening School.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.195 align:middle line:90%
They didn't put up a new sign

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.964 align:middle line:84%
but it became Washington
Evening High School

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:19.667 align:middle line:84%
for the pregnant girls or girls
who had babies or were pregnant

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.102 align:middle line:84%
and the guys who were
some form of delinquent.

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:24.071 align:middle line:84%
And this was my new
student body.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.707 align:middle line:90%
It was both scary and shaming.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:27.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How-- And you had come

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:31.278 align:middle line:84%
from being the class vice
president and drill team

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:32.546 align:middle line:90%
and all of that to this.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.815 align:middle line:84%
What happened to your
reality at that point?

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:37.084 align:middle line:84%
What decisions did you
make about yourself?

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Well, I didn't--

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.787 align:middle line:84%
you know, many times we make
decisions about ourselves

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:40.687 align:middle line:90%
that we're not aware of, right?

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I didn't even
know the decisions I was making

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.793 align:middle line:84%
about myself until
about a year later.

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:47.728 align:middle line:84%
The picture we're
seeing is when I graduate

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:90%
from high school in May of 1967.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.465 align:middle line:84%
My son had been born
in December.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:84%
Now I graduate from
Washington Evening High School.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And two months later, I'm
in an intensive care ward

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.772 align:middle line:84%
in hospital having
been diagnosed

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.641 align:middle line:90%
with fatal kidney disease.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.776 align:middle line:84%
One kidney was totally
destroyed with nephritis.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.946 align:middle line:84%
The other kidney had 50 percent
destruction, active nephritis.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:07.948 align:middle line:84%
And in 1967, this
is a death sentence.

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:09.083 align:middle line:90%
We don't have dialysis,

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.551 align:middle line:90%
we don't have transplant.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:11.318 align:middle line:90%
And I'm--

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And you were 18?

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Eighteen.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Eighteen.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And I'm-- I've
got a seven-month-old son.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
My mother was watching him
while his dad is working.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my God.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And I'm told that
if we can reduce the blood toxin

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:24.498 align:middle line:84%
in my-- level in my body enough
to remove the right kidney,

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:25.799 align:middle line:84%
then maybe I will
have six months

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.468 align:middle line:90%
to live and I'm terrified.

00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:84%
And the God of my upbringing
was not a friendly place to go

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
when you felt like
you'd really screwed up

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.141 align:middle line:90%
and that's how I felt.

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you're
being punished?

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And deep
down, that was my belief

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.679 align:middle line:84%
that I was being punished
for being a bad girl

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.248 align:middle line:84%
and shaming myself and
my school and my family.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.083 align:middle line:84%
And finally,
and the only reason I knew

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.119 align:middle line:84%
that is the night before
the surgery, a woman walked

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
into my
room who identified herself

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.856 align:middle line:84%
as a chaplain offering prayer
for people who were going

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.891 align:middle line:84%
to have surgery the next day and
asked me if I wanted somebody

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.092 align:middle line:84%
to pray with me and
I was scared.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.761 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK."

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:84%
She didn't
do anything that looked

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:56.196 align:middle line:84%
like anything I knew
about prayer.

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.899 align:middle line:84%
She pulled her chair next
to my bed and she said, "So,

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:59.967 align:middle line:90%
tell me what's been going

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.069 align:middle line:84%
on in your life the
last year or two?"

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.204 align:middle line:84%
And I told her my story and
at the end of which she said,

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
"Mary, everything's
created twice."

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:07.541 align:middle line:90%
And it went ptchoo!

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah, what are you
talking about?"

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.011 align:middle line:84%
She said,
"You know this.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:12.146 align:middle line:90%
In fact, everybody knows

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:15.049 align:middle line:84%
that almost nobody knows
the power of knowing it.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.984 align:middle line:84%
The bed you're lying on, the
nightgown you're wearing,

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.986 align:middle line:84%
the sheet covering you, the
walls, the ceiling, the floor,

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.422 align:middle line:84%
all the machinery you're
hooked up to, first,

00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:24.625 align:middle line:84%
it had to be a thought
before it could be a thing."

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:26.493 align:middle line:84%
Then she said again,
"You know this."

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
She said, "And since
we're now thinking

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
about how everything
is created twice,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.832 align:middle line:84%
I hear how much you
love your little boy

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:35.102 align:middle line:84%
and I also hear how much
you've been hating yourself.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:36.403 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you
shamed yourself

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.839 align:middle line:84%
and you shamed your family
and you shamed your school,

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.208 align:middle line:84%
and now that you're thinking
how everything is created twice,

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.276 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if
you couldn't see

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.211 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be a correlation

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.547 align:middle line:84%
between that toxic
thinking and the toxicity

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:48.081 align:middle line:90%
that is rampaging in your body--

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:50.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- and
threatening your very life."

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.821 align:middle line:84%
And then she gave me-- Lisa,
10 years later after I studied,

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:57.491 align:middle line:84%
what have happened I would call
it a technology or a new mindset

00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:84%
but she gave me a mental tool
and an emotional tool for how

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.996 align:middle line:84%
to use my mind after
the surgery.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.299 align:middle line:84%
The surgery was going to
happen the next morning.

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.567 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me
if I could believe

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.402 align:middle line:84%
that I could have a
complete healing that night

00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and in the morning the
doctors would say, "Get up.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.138 align:middle line:90%
Go home, you're fine."

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:12.406 align:middle line:84%
Could you believe--
can you believe

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:13.607 align:middle line:90%
that that's even possible?

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:14.942 align:middle line:90%
And I told her the truth, "No,

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:16.176 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that's
going to happen."

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:17.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:18.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I believed way
more in my pain

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
than anything she
was saying to me.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.315 align:middle line:90%
But then she said, "All right.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:22.716 align:middle line:84%
If you can't believe
that's possible,

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.853 align:middle line:84%
could you believe it's possible
that we could cause everything

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.621 align:middle line:84%
through a prayer, just
words and I'm going to say,

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.124 align:middle line:84%
but if you could help just
even consider there in--

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:31.725 align:middle line:84%
think of the universe",
she said,

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.862 align:middle line:84%
"Think of every possibility
that could ever exist.

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:38.632 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't there be one where we
could have used our imaginations

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:41.535 align:middle line:84%
and get everything that's
causing this toxicity.

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:45.272 align:middle line:84%
That's a genesis of this disease
in you to be swept

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.241 align:middle line:84%
into that one kidney and
when it's removed instead

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.675 align:middle line:84%
of getting worse
you get better."

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:49.676 align:middle line:90%
Is that even possible?

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.178 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was possible.

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Certainly no, MD had
told me it was possible

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.016 align:middle line:84%
but I could tell she
believed it was possible.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.484 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
don't know, but maybe--

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Even though, she didn't
know how and it wouldn't matter.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Well,
she didn't tell me how.

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:03.457 align:middle line:84%
She just said, "Could
you believe

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is a possibility
in which this could exist?"

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And then I
could tell she believed it.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:84%
So, I said, "Well, I don't
know, maybe it's possible,"

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle line:90%
And she's...

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.902 align:middle line:84%
So we-- in 1967, we knew
nothing about really mind,

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
body connection, we
didn't have a

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Law of attraction or--

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: We didn't
have a mind-body clinic

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.641 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard Medical
Teaching Center.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have Borders and
Barnes and Nobles

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.612 align:middle line:84%
with acres of self help
books around this topic.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.247 align:middle line:84%
Nor did we have
our new understanding

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.149 align:middle line:84%
around quantum physics,
but she knew

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:31.318 align:middle line:84%
that all she needed was one
corner of my mind opened

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.686 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility
and that's what I hope

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:34.054 align:middle line:90%
for our viewer today.

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:35.589 align:middle line:84%
Is that when we're--
by the time we're done,

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.958 align:middle line:84%
there will be one corner
of each person's mind open

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.527 align:middle line:84%
to a possibility for their
life that's beyond anything

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that they've ever really
thought could happen to them.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.964 align:middle line:90%
So she said, "OK."

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:44.932 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Maybe."

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:46.065 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "That's
all we need,

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
one corner of your mind
open at the possibility.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:90%
Let's work with that."

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:49.436 align:middle line:90%
She-- I don't know what word

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.939 align:middle line:84%
she said. It wasn't-- no
hair on my neck stood up.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:52.906 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear bells ring.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.541 align:middle line:90%
She left. I went to sleep.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing was they--
excuse me, when they woke me up,

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.714 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking,
"Wow, I slept all night."

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:04.017 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been able to do that
in weeks no matter how much pain

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
medication they gave
me because of the pain.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.855 align:middle line:84%
They did the surgery,
removed the right kidney.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:12.225 align:middle line:84%
And what she told
me to do was this.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.361 align:middle line:84%
She said, "When-- after
you wake up from the surgery,

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:16.296 align:middle line:84%
shortly thereafter, it's
not going to be very long

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.632 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is going to want
to go pick up that shame again,

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:19.733 align:middle line:90%
it's like a rubber band."

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:20.934 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey:
It'll want to go back

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:90%
and think those thoughts again.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.571 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I want you to do."

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.173 align:middle line:84%
She said, "You told me,"
and here's the next slide,

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.574 align:middle line:84%
"You told me you want
to be a teacher,"

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.376 align:middle line:84%
and that had been my dream
since I was a little girl.

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Originally, I thought it
was classical, you know,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.382 align:middle line:90%
classical classroom teaching.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:37.184 align:middle line:84%
It turned out not to
be that kind of teaching,

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.753 align:middle line:84%
but I knew I always wanted to be
a teacher and that look right.

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:40.454 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm pregnant.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:41.287 align:middle line:90%
I've got a little boy.

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.723 align:middle line:90%
Is this ever going to happen?

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:44.191 align:middle line:84%
"So here's what I
want you to do.

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.592 align:middle line:84%
I know how much you
love your little boy,

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:48.261 align:middle line:84%
so when your mind wants to think
those thoughts about yourself,

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.364 align:middle line:84%
those bad thoughts
about yourself, say, no.

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.633 align:middle line:84%
That left with the
kidney and then imagine",

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.601 align:middle line:84%
and she gave me three
imaginations, "Imagine,

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:56.203 align:middle line:84%
feel of your little
boy's hand in yours.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:58.705 align:middle line:84%
He's five years old
and you're walking in--

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.574 align:middle line:84%
you're walking him into
his kindergarten class

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:03.744 align:middle line:84%
and down the hallway is your
classroom, imagine that.

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.545 align:middle line:84%
And imagine sitting
in the front row

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.681 align:middle line:84%
of his high school
graduation, you're in a stadium,

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.417 align:middle line:84%
you're in a big auditorium of
some kind, and he's walking

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.386 align:middle line:84%
across the stage the
pride you feel, and

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.955 align:middle line:84%
how happy you are to see your
son graduate from high school

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.823 align:middle line:84%
and your teaching
career is growing.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:19.159 align:middle line:84%
And imagine sitting in the
front row of his wedding

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:84%
and he's marrying
the love of his life

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.729 align:middle line:84%
and your teaching
career is flourishing.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.966 align:middle line:84%
Just put on those three
imaginations and then go

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.334 align:middle line:90%
about your daily life.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.202 align:middle line:84%
And every time it comes up, say
no that left with the kidney

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:32.172 align:middle line:84%
and then put yourself in
these possible futures,

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:34.207 align:middle line:84%
but it's very important
that you feel his hand,

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.542 align:middle line:90%
that you feel your emotion,

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:38.612 align:middle line:84%
that you literally see
yourself inside the picture."

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:84%
She gave me a prescription
for how to set a mindset.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.949 align:middle line:90%
She didn't even tell me that.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.851 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was a
technology or a way to set...

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wait, all this
happened that night?

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:48.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: That
night, but the big thing

00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:50.857 align:middle line:84%
that happened was I did
what she told me to do.

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:51.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You listened, yes.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I did
what she told me to do.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.295 align:middle line:84%
And my numbers started
to improve gradually.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:90%
And two weeks later, I went home

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.866 align:middle line:84%
to my parents' house
in an ambulance.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle line:84%
And was in the urologist
office frequently like three

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle line:84%
or four times a week
for several weeks

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.707 align:middle line:84%
but my numbers steadily
started improving.

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:10.143 align:middle line:84%
And finally about
120 days later,

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting at the surgeon
and the specialists were there

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.082 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
at the reports

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:16.416 align:middle line:84%
and they're shaking their
heads and they said,

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:18.151 align:middle line:90%
"This is a medical anomaly.

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.487 align:middle line:84%
We have no medical reason
for what has happened

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.723 align:middle line:84%
that your right-- your left
kidney should be functioning

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.692 align:middle line:84%
perfectly but whatever
you're doing keep doing it."

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.494 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of that.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you make a
connection there that it was

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.232 align:middle line:84%
because of what you
were thinking or you--

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:33.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I don't
think I was aware enough--

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Not then?

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: -- at that point.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.839 align:middle line:84%
I just was-- it was-- I can
tell you, I was not aware enough

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:41.208 align:middle line:84%
but what I did have was
I thought something is

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.342 align:middle line:90%
happening here.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:43.777 align:middle line:84%
I need to know more if
I'm part of something

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle line:84%
that is much more powerful
and much more amazing

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:48.915 align:middle line:90%
than I had any idea of.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:49.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's amazing.

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:50.784 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And I've-- I
studied with everything I could.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I studied-- I got into an
undergraduate school.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.288 align:middle line:84%
I got a Master's Degree
in Counseling Psychology.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.124 align:middle line:90%
I attended a seminary.

00:10:57.124 --> 00:11:00.894 align:middle line:84%
I earned my way to
an experience where--

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:06.733 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I began to understand
that every thought we have,

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
not only has a vibration
to it, everything has--

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:90%
just like your television.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You know, people
get to watch Lisa Garr today,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.609 align:middle line:84%
because they knew what
frequency to tune to.

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:17.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And if they
tuned to a different frequency,

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:18.879 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to see Lisa Garr.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
see somebody else.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:84%
And once we begin to
realize that our dream--

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.418 align:middle line:84%
once we get to know our dream
in our mind, we can begin

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:27.254 align:middle line:84%
to get connected to it and
things began to change for me.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:30.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you remember
having the thoughts of--

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:33.426 align:middle line:84%
those future pacing
thoughts that she was giving you

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:39.566 align:middle line:84%
at the time that you got
that final bill of health?

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:40.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: I knew--

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Were you
practicing the work that you--

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I was
practicing it but it wasn't--

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.172 align:middle line:84%
I was paying more
attention at that point.

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:46.773 align:middle line:84%
It was just wherever I
would start to feel bad

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:48.642 align:middle line:90%
about myself I would see myself.

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:51.211 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was I got
involved in those images

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.679 align:middle line:84%
so I thought, "Well, if
I am going to be walking

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.713 align:middle line:90%
down the hall and getting

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.682 align:middle line:84%
into that classroom,
what would I do?"

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well...

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I'd
sign up for one class.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:58.718 align:middle line:90%
I can't go to college right now

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.654 align:middle line:84%
but I could sign
up for one class.

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:02.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you really
worked those images?

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I started
doing the thing I could do

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:07.694 align:middle line:84%
with what I did have and it
started moving both the energy,

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.263 align:middle line:90%
my biology, and my psychology.

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.967 align:middle line:84%
So then you-- I mean, now
that we know about the power

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:17.504 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and the way
that the brain fires and all

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
of the different parts of
your brain that you can use,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.877 align:middle line:84%
you were applying the
science that we now are aware

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:26.913 align:middle line:84%
of through physics and
quantum physics back then,

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:27.581 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:28.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that--

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Frankly,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.385 align:middle line:84%
any really successful person has
done most of them unconsciously

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what they were
doing why they were creating

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.356 align:middle line:90%
massive success.

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Will-- yeah.

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:38.892 align:middle line:84%
And the call it will
and so forth.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.728 align:middle line:84%
So now, fast forward to
you being a teacher--

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:42.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:43.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- and you
speaking and--

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:45.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: It
has opened up doors

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle line:84%
that learning how we
can set an intention,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.873 align:middle line:84%
follow that intention put a
mindset, match a mindset,

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:54.541 align:middle line:84%
take actions with
what we do have

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:57.777 align:middle line:84%
from where we are has opened
doors for me from speaking all

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:03.283 align:middle line:84%
over the world with friends
like Bob Proctor and Wayne Dyer.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've met many of the
people that are on your show--

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:09.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- and the
great teachers of our era.

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:11.424 align:middle line:90%
I've been very blessed.

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:14.294 align:middle line:84%
Over my life, I've built
two very successful businesses,

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.663 align:middle line:90%
had many ups and downs.

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:18.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you met the
Dalai Lama as we speak.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I had
the opportunity to--

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.735 align:middle line:90%
along with the Association

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:23.603 align:middle line:90%
for Global New Thought host

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate
three week-long meetings

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.742 align:middle line:90%
with him, which was his dream.

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:32.245 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to have three meetings
over a period of seven years

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:35.115 align:middle line:84%
where he would invite world
leaders to discuss how

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:39.319 align:middle line:84%
to solve collaboratively the
largest issues facing our world.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted a group--

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.957 align:middle line:84%
he wanted a few facilitators
who could understand,

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:46.259 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the many variant
religions that were going

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.029 align:middle line:84%
to be sitting inside that
room, the many view points,

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:51.932 align:middle line:84%
and help people come to a
synthesis of their genius

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:54.901 align:middle line:84%
rather than fighting
around different viewpoints

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.537 align:middle line:84%
to bring to a higher
viewpoint and I was selected.

00:13:57.537 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I sat right next to him for a
week and then a couple

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.308 align:middle line:90%
of years later...

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What was that like?

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:03.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: It was powerful.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.779 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
powerful-- it was powerful.

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:13.019 align:middle line:84%
I think the most powerful part
of it was to see him be such--

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.489 align:middle line:84%
everything you've ever heard
about him-- and what had--

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.892 align:middle line:84%
I had always wanted to ask
him, "How do you do it?

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:22.562 align:middle line:84%
How do you have 40 years of
oppression on you, your people,

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:25.265 align:middle line:84%
and yet in anything I
read or hear of you,

00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:28.868 align:middle line:84%
I never hear one wavelength
of bitterness or victimhood,

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
how do you use your mind?"

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.639 align:middle line:84%
So that-- I think if we would
cut anybody a little slack--

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my gosh.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- or
being a little bitter

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:90%
or a little victim--

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- so
much is going on.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:38.878 align:middle line:84%
And he's very careful
to distinguish and say,

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.513 align:middle line:90%
"This is not the Chinese people.

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.615 align:middle line:84%
This is a Chinese
government that has sought

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to decimate Tibet."

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.352 align:middle line:90%
And I work pieces--

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:47.487 align:middle line:84%
when I finally got to ask
that question, he said,

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.423 align:middle line:84%
"I worked vigorously for
the freedom of Tibet.

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:52.092 align:middle line:90%
But here's what I know in life."

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:55.996 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We all have friends,
friends easy love, easy forgive.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.298 align:middle line:84%
But we have our sacred
friends, very,

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:01.401 align:middle line:84%
very difficult sacred friends,
very, very difficult." He said,

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
"Without Chinese government,
I would never have had

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.775 align:middle line:84%
to evolve my heart to be
bigger than that pain."

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:09.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Big topic.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what a
question you even asked,

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:14.614 align:middle line:90%
how do you use your mind?

00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you use your mind?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: He said most
people feel compassionate

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:90%
after the fact.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.489 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have learned
to generate compassion not

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:90%
because of conditions

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.394 align:middle line:84%
but because condition is
the highest vibration,

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:29.696 align:middle line:84%
highest vibration
for mind and heart.

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:32.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, this goes
along with what, of course,

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.868 align:middle line:84%
you have a quote here
from Thomas Edison.

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes.

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And he says something
similar about physics.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.072 align:middle line:90%
This is not new information.

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:39.873 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:41.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: No.

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:43.276 align:middle line:84%
No. Yes, Edison said, "I
know this world is ruled

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.444 align:middle line:90%
by infinite intelligence."

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:47.247 align:middle line:84%
And how he knew it was
he had been as a kid.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:51.151 align:middle line:84%
At 14, 15, 16, his job was
as a telegraph operator

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:54.287 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains, in the,
you know, middle south,

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.924 align:middle line:84%
running a telegraph at
night, it was a nightshift.

00:15:57.924 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:84%
And he would wait for
those little signals

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.528 align:middle line:90%
for the telegraph to do his job.

00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:03.897 align:middle line:84%
And all through those
nights, he began to realize

00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:08.435 align:middle line:84%
that he was receiving other
signals, signals to his mind,

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:84%
ideas, and some of them
had electricity to them.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.474 align:middle line:84%
He would call them later,
but like sparks in them.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.876 align:middle line:84%
And later, he would say in life,
I mean this man arguably

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:19.679 align:middle line:84%
and what the Smithsonian
says, "The greatest inventor

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:22.382 align:middle line:84%
that humankind has ever
known, and he began to realize

00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:25.518 align:middle line:84%
that if you paid close attention
to the ideas that came his way

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:26.686 align:middle line:90%
that seemed expansive."

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:27.887 align:middle line:90%
They have some spark to them.

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:28.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:30.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
he wrote them down.

00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:32.192 align:middle line:84%
Even if he had no idea
how to do them, he said,

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:84%
he would later say, "I never met
a piece of paper I didn't like.

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.429 align:middle line:84%
I wrote down every
idea that came my way.

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.565 align:middle line:84%
I would circle the ones
that had electricity in them

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:39.799 align:middle line:90%
and start to act on them."

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Amazing.

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:43.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So he said,
"I know this world is ruled

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.038 align:middle line:90%
by infinite intelligence."

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:48.341 align:middle line:84%
We know today-- if you
go to the Smithsonian,

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.742 align:middle line:84%
you'll see in his
own hand writing.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:84%
"I shall discover and
deliver for the world a system

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:84%
of illumination that shall
completely replace our current

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:59.185 align:middle line:84%
dependency on oil
lamp illumination."

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.589 align:middle line:84%
Up until just 110 years ago
or so, if we wanted light

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.624 align:middle line:84%
after dark, we had to light
a fire, light an oil lamp.

00:17:04.624 --> 00:17:05.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: In almost
100,000 years of human history,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.663 align:middle line:84%
upright frontal lobe, self
reflected beings

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:12.197 align:middle line:90%
up until 100 years ago.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And this guy says, "There's got
to be another way to do it."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.703 align:middle line:84%
And he went to what he called
the land of the solution.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.505 align:middle line:84%
He knew that the mind
that he thought the idea

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.907 align:middle line:90%
up in had a solution.

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:24.077 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know the solution yet
but the mind, the idea was in.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.846 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have the idea
except the vehicle towards

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:29.182 align:middle line:90%
expression existed.

00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:32.018 align:middle line:84%
There's probably, you know,
eight or nine billion computers

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.853 align:middle line:84%
on the planet today
but there's not eight

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:36.456 align:middle line:84%
or nine billion internets,
there's one internet,

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:39.025 align:middle line:84%
but each computer
has an interface.

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
They say there are seven billion

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:84%
of us upright humans
on the planet today.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: But there's
not seven billion minds,

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:45.732 align:middle line:90%
there's one mind.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:46.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: One mind.

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
you and I interface

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:51.371 align:middle line:84%
with both what's happening in
our conditions and the idea

00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:53.339 align:middle line:84%
of the land of ideas
that we can tap into

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:54.841 align:middle line:90%
and think any idea we want.

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:55.675 align:middle line:90%
It cost no money.

00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:56.509 align:middle line:90%
It takes no more time--

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:57.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:58.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey:-- to think
how big a wonderful idea

00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:59.612 align:middle line:90%
than a little one.

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Just like you show
here with Eleanor Roosevelt

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.183 align:middle line:90%
and with amazing people.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:90%
She had a great quote.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.952 align:middle line:90%
Hers was, "All the water

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:08.922 align:middle line:84%
in the world can't drown you
unless it gets inside of you."

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, why did
you seek that quote out?

00:18:10.857 --> 00:18:12.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I sought that
quote out because I went

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:14.694 align:middle line:90%
through a rough path in my life.

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I was married to my
son's dad for 27 years.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.631 align:middle line:90%
We had four children together.

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.966 align:middle line:90%
If we'd waited five years,

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.568 align:middle line:84%
we knew that we would not have
married each other we were

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:22.735 align:middle line:90%
really never suited--

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: --
as great partners.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:25.705 align:middle line:84%
But we were great
parents together

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:26.806 align:middle line:90%
and we were great friends.

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is the
one that you had the--

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: First child.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
All four of my birth
kids, all we've--

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you married
very, very young?

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I married
very, very young.

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:36.049 align:middle line:84%
We were married 'til in our
early '40s, divorced.

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.018 align:middle line:84%
I-- A couple of years later,
married a second husband

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:44.924 align:middle line:84%
who was a CPA, brilliant and had
some depression and in the midst

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:47.427 align:middle line:84%
of an era of his life
had a bipolar episode

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:50.196 align:middle line:84%
and mingled money between
numerous companies,

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:53.199 align:middle line:84%
one of which was a company
I had founded and built,

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.567 align:middle line:90%
and I lost everything.

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:57.003 align:middle line:84%
I lost-- he ended in a mental
hospital, went to prison.

00:18:57.003 --> 00:18:58.304 align:middle line:90%
It was horrific.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.174 align:middle line:84%
I went from being the poster
child on the newspaper

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.976 align:middle line:84%
of the state I'd
grown up in for meeting

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.377 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama
or with the UN.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:07.347 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with the UN three
times or national selling books

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:08.748 align:middle line:90%
and all the great work--

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- to being
presented on the media

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:15.822 align:middle line:84%
of Portland as a minister
who was fleecing her flock.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:19.292 align:middle line:84%
And it took awhile for them to
realize what had really happened

00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't nearly
as interesting

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.995 align:middle line:84%
as the other sort of
dramatic stories--

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:22.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Story.

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:23.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: --
that got presented.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
I lost the work.

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:28.735 align:middle line:90%
I lost my house, the marriage.

00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:29.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: It was--

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.173 align:middle line:84%
I completed that work
but it was devastating

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.776 align:middle line:90%
on the level of personal hurt.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.611 align:middle line:90%
I felt betrayed, I felt used,

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.747 align:middle line:84%
I felt all the feelings
that any of us--

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:41.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Shamed?

00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:42.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: -- shamed, yeah.

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:43.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Back to those
feelings when you were 18.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah,

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:45.652 align:middle line:84%
and particularly the
feeling of betrayal.

00:19:45.652 --> 00:19:47.053 align:middle line:90%
And I began to realize

00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:50.423 align:middle line:84%
that every great hero story has
an element of betrayal in it.

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:51.391 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't get
that right away.

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.392 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that easy.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, did
you get right away

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.762 align:middle line:84%
that you were repeating
again another--

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:56.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: No.

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:56.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No?

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: No.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Of course not.

00:19:58.464 --> 00:19:59.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: But my friend--

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:01.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- But Jean
Houston pointed that out.

00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.436 align:middle line:84%
But-- what I did do that was
good for me and I would say

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:06.706 align:middle line:84%
to anybody going through a
rough time is that the energy of

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:09.342 align:middle line:84%
when it finally gets to where
it's really, really tough

00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:11.644 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, the--
you don't think

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:90%
about when-- heat under water.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.682 align:middle line:90%
Water stays in its liquid state.

00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:18.851 align:middle line:84%
You pull a heat under it,
it takes a time for it

00:20:18.851 --> 00:20:21.988 align:middle line:84%
to get hot enough to go through
a phase change where it turns

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
from one state to another,
from liquid to gas.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Liquid to gas.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: By the time
it's really in chaos,

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:30.596 align:middle line:84%
we know now with chaos
theory that is don't try

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.198 align:middle line:90%
to scoop through that time.

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:33.766 align:middle line:90%
Don't rush it.

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:37.203 align:middle line:84%
It's a very potent powerful time
to really look at ourselves,

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:39.072 align:middle line:84%
our lives, and what
matters to us

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.607 align:middle line:84%
and what do we really
want to bring forth.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.576 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Oregon Coast,
all I knew when I was hurting

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.279 align:middle line:84%
so much was just to get to the
Oregon Coast and walk the beach.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:48.314 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would stay for--
I rented a little place,

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:51.451 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would stay for a few
days, I stayed for three months.

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.319 align:middle line:84%
And the first few weeks,
all I could do was cry.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:53.986 align:middle line:90%
I was mad.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.254 align:middle line:90%
I was hurt.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.658 align:middle line:84%
I was blaming him how he
could left-- all the thoughts.

00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:02.929 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I just heard,
"Mary, you're still breathing."

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.832 align:middle line:84%
And I wept because I was so
happy to hear from that part

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:08.067 align:middle line:84%
of myself that I had
leaned on and listened

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:10.536 align:middle line:90%
to for many, many years.

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:12.839 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized it had not
gone anywhere.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:15.007 align:middle line:84%
I was just broadcasting
sadness so loud

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:15.641 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hear it.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:17.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: And then I heard,

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
"Dark chapter, not
your whole book."

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:22.515 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "I can
write a new-- oh, yes.

00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.051 align:middle line:84%
I could- this is a dark night of
the soul, it doesn't have

00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:27.854 align:middle line:84%
to be my whole-- the
whole rest of my life."

00:21:27.854 --> 00:21:29.856 align:middle line:84%
And I just began to
build again and I--

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That voice that
you thought was gone

00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:34.994 align:middle line:84%
or you could completely silence
you had just overshadowed.

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:36.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: I overshadowed.

00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:38.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you had
built her up ahead of time.

00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
She was doing a lot
of work ahead of time.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: It was a great
era even though it was the most

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:45.405 align:middle line:84%
difficult era in some ways
but I would say later,

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:48.374 align:middle line:84%
a couple years later in
my-- things begin to pick--

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:50.676 align:middle line:84%
and within a few months, people
are calling me again to speak

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:52.912 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things we
find and you'll find this

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:90%
with the people with--

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.649 align:middle line:84%
I know that you bring
here to your show.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:59.085 align:middle line:84%
We-- You and I have the
privilege of knowing and working

00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:01.621 align:middle line:84%
with amazing good
great human beings.

00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:03.322 align:middle line:84%
Not just great in there
success in the world

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.058 align:middle line:90%
but deep down good people.

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:06.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:22:06.092 --> 00:22:07.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Which
is what Gaiam's--

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:08.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- about is
helping us all discover

00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:09.495 align:middle line:90%
that greatness in us.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
my friends showed up.

00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:12.965 align:middle line:84%
My friends said,
come be on my stage.

00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:16.069 align:middle line:84%
Do this. And within two years,
I had built another very,

00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:19.372 align:middle line:84%
very and more successful
business than the one I'd lost.

00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:20.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What did you learn?

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I learned
two things.

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:23.509 align:middle line:84%
One of which is I would
never wish what I went

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
through on anybody
but I would wish

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:26.913 align:middle line:90%
where it took me on everybody.

00:22:26.913 --> 00:22:28.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Because it was
so powerful for me to both

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:32.752 align:middle line:90%
learn the power of, "All right,

00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:34.153 align:middle line:90%
look it square in the face,

00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:38.958 align:middle line:84%
own my part, remove the energies
that wanted to blame and attack

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:40.426 align:middle line:90%
and just...looking back,

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs said this
when he talked

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:43.362 align:middle line:90%
about being fired from Apple.

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.798 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You can always connect
the dots going backwards.

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't connect the
dots going forward."

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.569 align:middle line:84%
So I could look back
and say, "OK.

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:50.536 align:middle line:90%
Well, I could have seen this.

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:51.304 align:middle line:90%
I could have seen this.

00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:52.438 align:middle line:90%
I could have seen that."

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:55.274 align:middle line:84%
It was a great learning
experience.

00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:56.776 align:middle line:90%
In life, I'm remarried.

00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:57.643 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:22:57.643 --> 00:22:59.579 align:middle line:90%
And my kids, I mean, I--

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:01.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I mean there are so
many people that have been

00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:05.518 align:middle line:84%
through this major, major
traumas and we see them

00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:08.955 align:middle line:84%
like you have a slide
here of Amelia Earhart.

00:23:08.955 --> 00:23:10.289 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:11.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And what she had to
go through and the struggle

00:23:11.657 --> 00:23:13.025 align:middle line:84%
that she had to go
through as well.

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:14.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: That's right.

00:23:14.427 --> 00:23:16.529 align:middle line:84%
In an era where
women were not accepted

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:19.398 align:middle line:90%
and she just was a woman

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:22.235 align:middle line:84%
with the real fire in her
for what mattered to her

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's really
powerful for any of us who want

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to change a result in our life,
that we need the fire we have

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to really make something happen
that has not yet happened

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.712 align:middle line:90%
but we'd love for it to happen.

00:23:32.712 --> 00:23:36.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So after all of that
and all of your experiences,

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:40.019 align:middle line:84%
what age are you at, at
that particular pinnacle

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of your life after the...?

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I'm
about 55 at this point

00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:47.827 align:middle line:84%
when I lost the first-- the
business I built over 23 years.

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:50.329 align:middle line:90%
And 54, 55.

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:51.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:52.532 align:middle line:84%
That's a learning
experience in itself.

00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:53.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:53.866 align:middle line:90%
It's a decade ago.

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:54.934 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's not over.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yeah,
it was a decade ago.

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.837 align:middle line:84%
And I just began to build from
where I am with what I had

00:23:57.837 --> 00:23:59.872 align:middle line:84%
with the vision in mind,
which is what I learned to do

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:01.941 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
created twice.

00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:05.478 align:middle line:84%
So if you want-- you know, when
you throw a bolt of fabric out,

00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:07.914 align:middle line:84%
that bolt of fabric will
become anything you tell it

00:24:07.914 --> 00:24:10.917 align:middle line:84%
to be a napkin, a table
cloth, a dress, a shirt,

00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:13.152 align:middle line:84%
give it a pattern
and life is pouring

00:24:13.152 --> 00:24:14.453 align:middle line:90%
through us every single day.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.323 align:middle line:84%
The energy of life and
we do give it a pattern.

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:19.225 align:middle line:84%
We give it a pattern, which
is called our mindset.

00:24:19.225 --> 00:24:22.395 align:middle line:84%
What we deeply believe
and what we think about.

00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:25.264 align:middle line:84%
One of the key clues that
I work with individuals

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.934 align:middle line:84%
and helping them
change their results,

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:31.537 align:middle line:84%
if you keep breathing another
365 days you will have a life.

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.306 align:middle line:84%
You can measure it, in
your health, in your--

00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:36.142 align:middle line:84%
the quality and depth of your
relationships, what you're doing

00:24:36.142 --> 00:24:39.278 align:middle line:84%
with your talent or not,
and your time and money

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and freedom shows
up on your calendar,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.681 align:middle line:90%
it shows up in your checkbook.

00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:42.949 align:middle line:90%
We can measure it.

00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:46.953 align:middle line:84%
And that-- it's an effect,
it's not happening to us,

00:24:46.953 --> 00:24:48.187 align:middle line:90%
it's happening with us.

00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:50.356 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great things
you bring people is how

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:53.693 align:middle line:84%
to change the result that
is happening in their life

00:24:53.693 --> 00:24:55.962 align:middle line:84%
if in fact they want
to change the result.

00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:56.963 align:middle line:90%
So, Steve Jobs--

00:24:56.963 --> 00:24:58.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Sorry?

00:24:58.064 --> 00:24:59.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- we
go back for him, yeah.

00:24:59.398 --> 00:25:01.601 align:middle line:84%
He-- you know, he watched the
Jetsons when he was a kid.

00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:05.237 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that if, you
know, if those things--

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.939 align:middle line:84%
if you can think them
up, they can happen.

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.774 align:middle line:84%
He studied Buddhism,
he understood

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:10.876 align:middle line:84%
that if you can have
an idea in the mind,

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.411 align:middle line:90%
you think with that the means

00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:14.714 align:middle line:84%
by which it can come
about isn't known.

00:25:14.714 --> 00:25:16.482 align:middle line:84%
Same thing that happened
with John Kennedy,

00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:18.551 align:middle line:84%
when John Kennedy-- I didn't
put a slide in here of him,

00:25:18.551 --> 00:25:21.687 align:middle line:84%
but when he said to Wernher von
Braun, the premier scientist

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:25.658 align:middle line:84%
of that day, in the early '60s,
he says, "So what would it take

00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:28.928 align:middle line:84%
to send a man to the moon and
bring him back safely to Earth?"

00:25:28.928 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And Wernher von Braun did
not talk about the amount

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.832 align:middle line:84%
of money it would-- the
appropriations from Congress.

00:25:32.832 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- the science
it would have to be developed

00:25:35.334 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:84%
about Canaveral being
built or Houston being--

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.437 align:middle line:84%
he didn't talk about
the astronauts.

00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:39.739 align:middle line:90%
He talked nothing about that.

00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
He said five words.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.209 align:middle line:84%
"What would it take to
do this great thing?

00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:45.478 align:middle line:84%
What would it take to
do this great thing?"

00:25:45.478 --> 00:25:47.513 align:middle line:84%
And Wernher von Braun gave
him a five-word answer.

00:25:47.513 --> 00:25:48.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:50.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: The will to do it.

00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:51.484 align:middle line:90%
You have to have the will.

00:25:51.484 --> 00:25:52.351 align:middle line:90%
You said will earlier.

00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:53.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:53.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You
have the will--

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, yes.

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Even when the
circumstances don't work out.

00:25:56.689 --> 00:25:57.256 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the will even
when somebody doesn't approve.

00:25:57.256 --> 00:25:58.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:58.324 --> 00:25:59.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You
have to have the will

00:25:59.325 --> 00:25:59.892 align:middle line:84%
when the money hasn't
shown up yet.

00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You
have to have the will.

00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:02.395 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing I'm doing.

00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:04.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
then you get support.

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:05.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I have a
very strong will.

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.133 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:08.701 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it gets me in
a little bit of trouble

00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:10.136 align:middle line:90%
because I dream way too big.

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But it gets you to that
place of uncomfortability

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.941 align:middle line:90%
that you get to the next step.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:16.776 align:middle line:90%
So it's not easy.

00:26:16.776 --> 00:26:18.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: No, it's not easy

00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and successful people are always
willing to be uncomfortable

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.815 align:middle line:84%
in the interest of
growth, not in the interest

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:23.749 align:middle line:90%
of just being uncomfortable.

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:24.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well, I'm not willing

00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:26.552 align:middle line:84%
to be uncomfortable,
it just happens.

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:27.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Well, some
part of you is

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:28.287 align:middle line:84%
or it wouldn't
be happening.

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:29.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I guess so, right.

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:30.589 align:middle line:90%
>>Morrissey: Yes.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what would you
tell people and it's so great

00:26:32.191 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're here because you
are a true inspiration to people

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.364 align:middle line:84%
who have been through such a
tough time and come out of it,

00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:42.702 align:middle line:84%
not once but twice
in teenage years

00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:44.637 align:middle line:90%
and then in an adult career.

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:47.606 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at this
from a teaching perspective

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.276 align:middle line:84%
and somebody is looking
at their, their health

00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.478 align:middle line:84%
and well-being in every
era of their life.

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:53.579 align:middle line:90%
So you've got--

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:54.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So when
you dream your dream.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:55.381 align:middle line:90%
So here's the deal.

00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:57.316 align:middle line:84%
You keep breathing
another 365 days times 3,

00:26:57.316 --> 00:26:59.085 align:middle line:90%
it's three years from now.

00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:01.454 align:middle line:84%
And look around, what would you
love your life to look like?

00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:03.389 align:middle line:84%
Because in the absence
of you giving

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:06.125 align:middle line:84%
that mind you think with
an intelligent design,

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.793 align:middle line:84%
like you put a pattern
on that bolt of fabric--

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:08.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:09.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- if you
want it to be something.

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:10.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So you
give it a pattern,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.198 align:middle line:90%
blueprint it is the first phase.

00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:13.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: You blue print it.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.634 align:middle line:84%
You create a blueprint in
your mind but you can't do

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
that 'til you pay attention
to what it is your longing

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.271 align:middle line:90%
and what it is your discontent.

00:27:19.271 --> 00:27:21.807 align:middle line:84%
You know, where am I feeling
crammed in, in my life?

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:23.776 align:middle line:84%
Where am I feeling
like, "Uh, I just want--

00:27:23.776 --> 00:27:26.112 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of playing the
money may I game?

00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:26.879 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired."

00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:28.247 align:middle line:90%
That's a good sign.

00:27:28.247 --> 00:27:30.916 align:middle line:84%
That's life telling
you, "Hey, I'm bigger."

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:31.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You've reached
your limit.

00:27:31.784 --> 00:27:33.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So, pay attention to your
longing and your discontent

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.055 align:middle line:84%
and look at your
health and well-being,

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:90%
what would you love it to be?

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.691 align:middle line:90%
Just name it.

00:27:38.691 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:84%
Get a picture for it like
taking your little boy

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.861 align:middle line:84%
into kindergarten
class and you're going

00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:43.729 align:middle line:90%
down the hallway to your class.

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:45.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nice.

00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:46.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: That's a nice good
picture, three years from now,

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:48.334 align:middle line:84%
health and well-being,
friendship.

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:50.302 align:middle line:84%
Who are the friends in
your life right now?

00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:52.304 align:middle line:84%
What would you love those
friendships to be like?

00:27:52.304 --> 00:27:53.806 align:middle line:90%
Who would you love to have?

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:27:55.074 --> 00:27:56.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You can talk..
like me, imagine talking

00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:57.476 align:middle line:84%
to the Dalai Lama
or Nelson Mandela.

00:27:57.476 --> 00:28:00.546 align:middle line:84%
I imagined them first long
before the meetings, shake

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:01.247 align:middle line:90%
their hands--

00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:02.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:03.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- get to
know you, those it started

00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:04.016 align:middle line:90%
in the mind.

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:05.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You saw that first.

00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:06.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So what
would you love, romance.

00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:09.088 align:middle line:84%
For some of us, you
know, over the years,

00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:12.992 align:middle line:84%
one of the saddest things for me
is to hear somebody say, "Well,

00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:15.995 align:middle line:84%
it's not in the cards
for me, it's just not"--

00:28:15.995 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
or "it's not in my
soul pattern," or--

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.633 align:middle line:84%
that is a superstitious
around romance

00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:22.201 align:middle line:84%
or any other result
in our life.

00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:26.105 align:middle line:84%
It's superstitious to say some
outside force is controlling my

00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:84%
ability to create a result
I would love as to look

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:32.878 align:middle line:84%
down the street, on the street
where you're living, say, "Look,

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:35.681 align:middle line:84%
everybody else gets
electricity but not me.

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:37.716 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's not in
my soul pattern.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.119 align:middle line:84%
I am not hooked up
to the circuitry

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.187 align:middle line:90%
that produces the result."

00:28:41.187 --> 00:28:42.488 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:43.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's all of it--
that's all you're saying.

00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:44.757 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:28:44.757 --> 00:28:45.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So,
that's what it is.

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:45.925 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:46.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So you look at--

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:48.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: My time
and money freedom.

00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:50.329 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have money patterns
that we inherited often as kids.

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:52.865 align:middle line:84%
Money doesn't grow on trees,
you know, you have to save.

00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:55.968 align:middle line:84%
You know, save for a rainy
day, save for a rainy day.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.604 align:middle line:84%
Don't invest in a sunny life,
save for a rainy day.

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:02.074 align:middle line:84%
And get your benefits,
you know, trade your life

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:04.143 align:middle line:84%
on what you really care about
but be sure you have benefits.

00:29:04.143 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
patterns get installed

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.947 align:middle line:90%
or that money isn't spiritual,

00:29:07.947 --> 00:29:11.283 align:middle line:84%
or that rich people don't
have good ethics so they have

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to be crooks to be-- I
mean, all of these ideas

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.322 align:middle line:84%
that seep away, they're
like seeds in the garden

00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:18.824 align:middle line:84%
that can only grow the result
of the seed that it is.

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:20.893 align:middle line:84%
So, one things is we help
people to get images

00:29:20.893 --> 00:29:22.461 align:middle line:90%
of what they would love.

00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that
somebody really asks you,

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.832 align:middle line:84%
what would you love rather than
what do you think you can do.

00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:27.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What would you love?

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: What
would you love?

00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:31.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I see that a lot
in your work that question.

00:29:31.036 --> 00:29:31.804 align:middle line:90%
What do you love?

00:29:31.804 --> 00:29:32.571 align:middle line:90%
What would you love?

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.572 align:middle line:90%
What would you love?

00:29:33.572 --> 00:29:34.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Because
what happens is

00:29:34.707 --> 00:29:36.141 align:middle line:84%
when you watch somebody
when you start letting--

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:38.477 align:middle line:84%
helping them talk
about what they love,

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.613 align:middle line:84%
they light up that you
can just see it on them,

00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.815 align:middle line:84%
they light up because they--
it's just even in that moment,

00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:46.085 align:middle line:84%
even in their imagination,
life is getting released.

00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:49.321 align:middle line:84%
And give it a pattern, it
knows to do stuff you and I

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:52.491 align:middle line:84%
on our own-- in our own
conscious mind would never know

00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:54.393 align:middle line:90%
how to do.

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: But--

00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:56.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- it is
sacred, it's wonderful.

00:29:58.063 --> 00:29:59.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Now.

00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:01.367 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also mentioned about
specificity like, you know,

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:02.735 align:middle line:90%
in the case of travel.

00:30:02.735 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So travel is something that
you have in terms of a goal

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:90%
and you really want to travel.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, it matters--
yeah, if you say I just want

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to travel in my life," your mind
can't get a picture for travel.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.279 align:middle line:90%
Your mind thinks in pictures.

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.714 align:middle line:84%
So, if I say to you your
front door of where you live,

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:18.284 align:middle line:84%
the kitchen sink in your house,
the bed you sleep in.

00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:19.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:21.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You did not
see the letters, B-E-D.

00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:22.688 align:middle line:90%
You saw a picture of a bed.

00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:23.455 align:middle line:90%
You saw a picture of a sink.

00:30:23.455 --> 00:30:24.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:25.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You saw
a picture of a door.

00:30:25.124 --> 00:30:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:27.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So, when you
give the mind a picture,

00:30:27.393 --> 00:30:28.761 align:middle line:84%
it can pour energy
through that picture.

00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So, give it a-- you want to go
to India, you want to go to,

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.332 align:middle line:84%
you know, Rome, give
it a picture.

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:36.001 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients not too long
ago, she was struggling with--

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.237 align:middle line:84%
you know, I said, "But
where would you love to go?"

00:30:38.237 --> 00:30:38.938 align:middle line:90%
and I'm thinking.

00:30:38.938 --> 00:30:41.073 align:middle line:90%
And she says, "Wyoming."

00:30:41.073 --> 00:30:41.907 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I said--

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:43.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:44.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- "Wyoming,"
you know, and as of, you know,

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:45.544 align:middle line:90%
in our world, you never tell--

00:30:45.544 --> 00:30:47.212 align:middle line:84%
we never know what
somebody is going to dream.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:49.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Wyoming, OK--

00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:50.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: She wants to
go to the ranch, yeah.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I just
say, "Why is it-- why--

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.851 align:middle line:84%
what's in Wyoming
you would love?"

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.722 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "There's a place
there where they love animals

00:30:56.722 --> 00:30:59.458 align:middle line:84%
who had been used in
medical experiments,

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:00.826 align:middle line:84%
and they love them back to life
and I want

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:02.962 align:middle line:84%
to volunteer there
for two weeks."

00:31:02.962 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And she dreamed it up.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.531 align:middle line:84%
And the next time I saw her,
it was about six months later

00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.099 align:middle line:84%
with another event and
she says, "Guess what,

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:08.767 align:middle line:90%
I just got back from Wyoming."

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:10.135 align:middle line:90%
And you could just see in her.

00:31:10.135 --> 00:31:13.739 align:middle line:84%
See, I never know what it is
it's going to like somebody up

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:16.141 align:middle line:84%
but my work is about helping
them find what that is

00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:17.376 align:middle line:90%
and helping empower them.

00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:18.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And just listening.

00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:19.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You know,
empower them so with

00:31:19.678 --> 00:31:21.413 align:middle line:84%
that can really be the
result they're having,

00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:22.815 align:middle line:90%
that's the fun part.

00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, the idea is being
specific, creating pictures,--

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:27.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- creating vision
boards, which we talked about.

00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: We
talked about, yeah.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And all
right, so if you want--

00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:31.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: A philanthropy,
yeah.

00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:32.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- and which
is what she did.

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: As you get your--
see money is really only good

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
for two things, money is good to
help you be comfortable enough

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.066 align:middle line:84%
so you can be creative enough
to give your real gift,

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.569 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- yeah, actually.

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:44.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:31:44.937 --> 00:31:46.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:47.439 align:middle line:84%
And then-- so you can give
what you really, you know,

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:48.774 align:middle line:84%
go where you want to go
and do what you want to do,

00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:50.576 align:middle line:84%
have it what you want to have
but that only goes so far,

00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.444 align:middle line:84%
the rest is give what
you really what to give.

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:55.681 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't think there's
been a time in human history

00:31:55.681 --> 00:31:58.017 align:middle line:84%
where we need more people
to be free to be able

00:31:58.017 --> 00:31:59.151 align:middle line:84%
to help our world
than right now.

00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:00.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And that's
why you do what you do

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.121 align:middle line:90%
and why I do what I do.

00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:02.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:03.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:04.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, tell me
the story of a client

00:32:04.723 --> 00:32:06.425 align:middle line:90%
that had amazing success.

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:07.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes, all right.

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:09.128 align:middle line:84%
There was
woman named Dani who worked

00:32:09.128 --> 00:32:11.397 align:middle line:84%
for the city of Portland who
came to an event I was doing

00:32:11.397 --> 00:32:14.299 align:middle line:84%
and we were going through the
dream builder exercises.

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:84%
First, we were-- and she
was pretty stuck on the,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.106 align:middle line:84%
what would you love because she
had a pattern in her program

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:24.476 align:middle line:84%
that said, "When I retire
then I can", and that program

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
because she'd had a job
where she had benefits

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.748 align:middle line:84%
and she was well-patterned
with--

00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:32.351 align:middle line:84%
you do the job for 30 years then
you go do something you'd really

00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.485 align:middle line:90%
love to do.

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:34.686 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, just
tell me about your life.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.321 align:middle line:84%
When do you come most
alive?

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:39.124 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well, besides
with my kids and my husband.

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:41.360 align:middle line:84%
My job is good but
in the spring,

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.764 align:middle line:84%
when I plant my fragrant flowers
and I grow hanging baskets,

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:48.634 align:middle line:84%
I build five hanging
baskets every year.

00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.002 align:middle line:84%
I gave one to my
mother and my sister,

00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and then all year I'm thinking
about whom I going to give.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.338 align:middle line:84%
It might be the new
female mayor.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:57.109 align:middle line:84%
It might be the new junior
high female principal.

00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:59.111 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always thinking what--
who are other three women.

00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:00.446 align:middle line:90%
I love that part of my life.

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:02.648 align:middle line:84%
I just come alive during
that part of my life."

00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:04.249 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Dani, what
if you could have more

00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:90%
of that in your life?"

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.818 align:middle line:90%
She said, "No, no, no."

00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:07.152 align:middle line:90%
She said, "After I retire,

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:09.655 align:middle line:84%
then I think I'll have a little
garden and dah, dah, dah,"

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:13.125 align:middle line:84%
and we just helped her-- just
imagine long enough and she felt

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:16.295 align:middle line:84%
so alive in that imagination and
she just had a great event.

00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:17.062 align:middle line:90%
She was there.

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:18.063 align:middle line:90%
She went away.

00:33:18.063 --> 00:33:19.398 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I'd
ever see her again

00:33:19.398 --> 00:33:22.034 align:middle line:84%
but within a month she came
back, asked for an appointment

00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:23.235 align:middle line:90%
and she and her husband, Jeff,

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:25.471 align:middle line:84%
who was a truck driver
had made a decision she'd gone

00:33:25.471 --> 00:33:28.207 align:middle line:84%
and gotten a leave of
absence from her job for a year,

00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:29.508 align:middle line:90%
they'd found a plot of ground.

00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:32.177 align:middle line:84%
They'd borrowed some
money on their equity.

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:35.647 align:middle line:84%
She had a plan she had a name,
Ferguson's Fragrant Nursery,

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:37.616 align:middle line:84%
and they found a place and
it was outside of Portland.

00:33:37.616 --> 00:33:38.784 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Dani, you know,

00:33:38.784 --> 00:33:40.586 align:middle line:84%
this is old same location,
location, location."

00:33:40.586 --> 00:33:42.588 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm being the,
you know, doubting--

00:33:42.588 --> 00:33:43.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, right.

00:33:43.555 --> 00:33:44.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: --
doubting one there.

00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "No, no, no.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.059 align:middle line:84%
It is going to
become a landmark place.

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
travel to come there.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.661 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have-- we're
going to weddings.

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:50.796 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have ceremonies,

00:33:50.796 --> 00:33:51.864 align:middle line:84%
and we're
going to have wine parties."

00:33:51.864 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And she dreamed this
dream within a year.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.567 align:middle line:90%
Jeff had quit his job.

00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:57.002 align:middle line:90%
He is helping build this thing.

00:33:57.002 --> 00:33:58.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Those are
her-- those were Dani's--

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:01.273 align:middle line:84%
this is probably two and a
half or three years into it.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:04.309 align:middle line:84%
There is Dani's-- not
just five baskets, I mean,

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.945 align:middle line:84%
cities would come and order
them for their main streets.

00:34:06.945 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: She was speaking--

00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:10.615 align:middle line:84%
Sunset Magazine was
doing articles about her.

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:13.685 align:middle line:84%
She was speaking at the garden
clubs in the...

00:34:13.685 --> 00:34:16.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was it because of the
rags-to-riches story or because

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:18.356 align:middle line:90%
a pursue your dream story?

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:19.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: It was a dream--

00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:21.994 align:middle line:84%
for me isn't probably
never really riches,

00:34:21.994 --> 00:34:25.164 align:middle line:84%
it was that she loved this
thing right into existence

00:34:25.164 --> 00:34:28.367 align:middle line:84%
and that she was so passionate
about fragrant flowers,

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
she was so passionate
about what happens.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.474 align:middle line:84%
So, we can see-- yeah,
there's the gardens and--

00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: She created her dream.

00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:37.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: She and
Jeff created their dream.

00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:40.746 align:middle line:84%
Their kids grew up working
in the nursery with them.

00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:42.314 align:middle line:84%
They had many, many
people employed

00:34:42.314 --> 00:34:45.517 align:middle line:84%
and about two years ago, Lisa,
I get a call in a January,

00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:49.153 align:middle line:84%
I'd long since we move to
California, this was in Oregon.

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:50.222 align:middle line:90%
It's January.

00:34:50.222 --> 00:34:51.923 align:middle line:84%
I just pick-- randomly
picked up my phone

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:84%
and it's Dani and
Dani is crying.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.295 align:middle line:84%
And she says-- I said,
"Dani, what's going on?"

00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:59.097 align:middle line:84%
And she's could hardly get
it out and she said, "Mary,

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:84%
I woke up this morning
and Jeff didn't."

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:03.368 align:middle line:84%
I was, "Oh, Dani,
I'm so sorry."

00:35:03.368 --> 00:35:04.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How old was Dani.

00:35:04.169 --> 00:35:05.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: 57 years old.

00:35:05.237 --> 00:35:07.072 align:middle line:84%
He went to bed, he
didn't wake up.

00:35:07.072 --> 00:35:09.274 align:middle line:84%
He had a heart attack
in the night.

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.009 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me if
I'd come to Oregon

00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:14.079 align:middle line:84%
and perform his cer--
memorialize, of course.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:17.382 align:middle line:84%
And here's the moment I
want to pass on is that we--

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:20.052 align:middle line:84%
a family usually
gathers with the minister

00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:21.486 align:middle line:84%
or the person conducting
the service

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.389 align:middle line:84%
in a private room while
people gather in a sanctuary.

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:25.791 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the front
row is saved.

00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.192 align:middle line:84%
And so as the family is
filing out

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:29.928 align:middle line:84%
and her kids are now grown but
I mean everyone is...

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:32.097 align:middle line:90%
no one got to say goodbye.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:34.466 align:middle line:90%
It's very-- was very sad.

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:36.335 align:middle line:84%
And just before Dani was
walking out, I was coming

00:35:36.335 --> 00:35:39.271 align:middle line:84%
out behind her and she turned
around, she took my hands

00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:42.441 align:middle line:84%
and with tears, she looked at
me and she said, "Thank you.

00:35:42.441 --> 00:35:43.575 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:45.611 align:middle line:84%
We would still be
waiting for good benefits.

00:35:45.611 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd still be waiting
for my benefits."

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.115 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's a little funny on
one side but on the other side,

00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:53.518 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "I would
still be waiting."

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "The real benefit
is that I got to work side

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:59.725 align:middle line:84%
by side with Jeff with all
those hours, all those days--

00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:00.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All those years.

00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- all
that time together.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:36:02.694 --> 00:36:03.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: My kids got
to work with their dad. We

00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:84%
got to instill his
values in them."

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.531 align:middle line:84%
She said, "We never
thought this was coming.

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
We would have
still been waiting."

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's full circle.

00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:10.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: And I--

00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:12.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's the reason
to follow your dreams.

00:36:12.371 --> 00:36:13.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: That's the
reason to follow your dream.

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.339 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to stay again.

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:15.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You'll never know.

00:36:15.374 --> 00:36:16.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
he never get this--

00:36:16.308 --> 00:36:17.175 align:middle line:90%
it's not on a morbid

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's not that.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.746 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you will
never get this day again,

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:21.613 align:middle line:90%
not one of us.

00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:22.814 align:middle line:90%
Not in eternity.

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:23.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So what do you love?

00:36:23.982 --> 00:36:24.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
what do you love.

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:25.851 align:middle line:90%
Make it matter today.

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:27.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:28.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And make it
matter on your calendar.

00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:31.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That is-- that's
such a great story and it's

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:34.059 align:middle line:84%
such an inspirational story for
people that are in that place

00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:36.361 align:middle line:84%
that they know that there is
something better but terrified

00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:37.829 align:middle line:90%
to go ahead and try it.

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:41.266 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned here-- now,
the practicality of how to do

00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:45.304 align:middle line:84%
that is always scary, but you
go back to these great quotes,

00:36:45.304 --> 00:36:47.372 align:middle line:84%
here's one from Albert
Einstein that you say--

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: "Everything is energy,
and that's all there is."

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.911 align:middle line:84%
Explain to me why this makes
so much sense to you.

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:54.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Well we
know now with physics.

00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:56.982 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's different
names for it some of

00:36:56.982 --> 00:36:59.284 align:middle line:84%
which is most recent
is the string theory

00:36:59.284 --> 00:37:00.752 align:middle line:90%
that every electron, every--

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:05.357 align:middle line:84%
even visible and
invisible energy is--

00:37:05.357 --> 00:37:07.092 align:middle line:84%
they call it now it's
sitting and superposition,

00:37:07.092 --> 00:37:09.561 align:middle line:84%
meaning it would become
anything you tell it.

00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:12.998 align:middle line:84%
And that the observer affect
is that whatever you believe,

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
things organize around
that belief

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:84%
because if I have a white piece
of paper and I put a magnet

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:20.072 align:middle line:84%
under it, and I put iron
filings on this paper,

00:37:20.072 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
they're just randomly
lying there.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.111 align:middle line:84%
When I bring a magnet to it,
they move into the pattern.

00:37:26.111 --> 00:37:27.946 align:middle line:84%
I can't see it with
my five senses

00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:30.649 align:middle line:90%
but there is a magnetic field

00:37:30.649 --> 00:37:34.519 align:middle line:84%
that organizes how those iron
filings move into a pattern.

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:36.755 align:middle line:84%
Our thinking has
a pattern to it.

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.824 align:middle line:84%
It communicates through the
spinal fluid up and down

00:37:38.824 --> 00:37:43.829 align:middle line:84%
on our spinal cord, moves to
our tissues or every cell organ

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:45.731 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't end
with our skin.

00:37:45.731 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So, when we're hungry, we see
things to eat or are tuned

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.436 align:middle line:84%
to look for what
we're interested in.

00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:52.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:37:52.838 --> 00:37:54.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Some of us have
got interested in our problems.

00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And so we get--

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what
we look for.

00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:57.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- to see
more and more problems.

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:58.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what
we look for.

00:37:58.977 --> 00:38:00.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So, when we train
people to get interested in,

00:38:00.379 --> 00:38:02.047 align:middle line:84%
which is what you're doing with
your show, how to get interested

00:38:02.047 --> 00:38:03.515 align:middle line:90%
in what really matters to you.

00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:04.583 align:middle line:84%
And one of the major
clues is

00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:06.852 align:middle line:90%
to notice what you're noticing.

00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:08.387 align:middle line:84%
If you-- it's a practice
where you start and--

00:38:08.387 --> 00:38:09.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Where are
your thoughts?

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Start noticing.

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And is it expansive?
Lean into it.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.493 align:middle line:84%
If it's contractive,
rearrange it.

00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:16.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, rearrange it just
like this picture shows here.

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:19.297 align:middle line:84%
I love this picture of
the little fish jumping

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.866 align:middle line:90%
into the big fishbowl.

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:22.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, when Einstein
says match the frequency

00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:24.403 align:middle line:84%
and the reality you
want, it must be yours,

00:38:24.403 --> 00:38:28.173 align:middle line:84%
just like when your television
comes on if you're tired of CNN,

00:38:28.173 --> 00:38:30.375 align:middle line:84%
constantly negative
news, CNN just tune in

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:31.743 align:middle line:90%
to a different frequency.

00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:33.378 align:middle line:84%
All those don't have
to do therapy

00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to get
those pictures to go away--

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But this picture here,

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.784 align:middle line:84%
it shows that the fish is
jumping into a bigger bowl?

00:38:38.784 --> 00:38:39.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, bigger bowl.

00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:40.719 align:middle line:90%
That's its dream.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:41.253 align:middle line:90%
And right now--

00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:42.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:38:42.087 --> 00:38:43.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: -- it's in midair.

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:44.623 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know if
he's going to make it.

00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:47.292 align:middle line:84%
But we know it couldn't possibly
make it if doesn't do that job.

00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:49.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it dreams
of the bigger bowl.

00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:50.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Well, the
Talmud said, "Every blade

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:54.733 align:middle line:84%
of grass has an angel that leans
over it and whispers grow, grow,

00:38:54.733 --> 00:38:56.902 align:middle line:84%
grow," and that blade of grass
will press through cement--

00:38:56.902 --> 00:38:58.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:38:58.003 --> 00:38:58.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- seeking
to be the best blade

00:38:58.804 --> 00:39:00.405 align:middle line:90%
of grass it can become.

00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:04.009 align:middle line:84%
That same impulse is in every
one of us, become more, share,

00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:06.711 align:middle line:84%
give, be more, every day,
we're feeling it.

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.448 align:middle line:84%
If we don't express
it and we suppress it,

00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:12.884 align:middle line:84%
it has to create a symptom
of some kind to say, "Hey."

00:39:12.884 --> 00:39:13.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's true.

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it will show it
to us in disease form or--

00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:16.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Right, yeah.

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:17.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Exactly.

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Absolutely.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So now, there's
another story that you have of--

00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:22.828 align:middle line:90%
I think his name is John.

00:39:22.828 --> 00:39:23.595 align:middle line:90%
Is that John?

00:39:23.595 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.131 align:middle line:84%
This is a fun story for me
because this is actually my--

00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:29.067 align:middle line:84%
this is the son that was
born in December of 1966.

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:30.936 align:middle line:84%
The one that was
born when I'm going

00:39:30.936 --> 00:39:33.405 align:middle line:84%
to Washington Evening
High School and--

00:39:33.405 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is your son
that we're talking about?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes.

00:39:36.675 --> 00:39:38.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oops, that
looks...

00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:39.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So, that's the
house of he and his wife Dora,

00:39:39.044 --> 00:39:41.313 align:middle line:90%
lived in with their son Ricardo.

00:39:41.313 --> 00:39:43.048 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and it's a
perfect little house

00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:45.117 align:middle line:84%
and they're totally contented
and they live in Cabo San Lucas,

00:39:45.117 --> 00:39:48.186 align:middle line:84%
Mexico and he is growing in
his management career there.

00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:48.954 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:49.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: This is your son?

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:50.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: My
son, my only son.

00:39:50.422 --> 00:39:50.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:39:50.856 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So this is about--
and this is John and Dora,

00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:59.564 align:middle line:84%
and Ricardo a number of years
ago, and then they're grown.

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:02.534 align:middle line:84%
They have two new
babies, their two twins,

00:40:02.534 --> 00:40:03.702 align:middle line:90%
Kara

00:40:03.702 --> 00:40:05.036 align:middle line:90%
and Kayla come in the world.

00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:08.707 align:middle line:84%
And then, I go to visit John
and I said to him, this is--

00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:09.975 align:middle line:90%
several years later and I said--

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:11.943 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting on his patio
having a glass of iced tea

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:12.944 align:middle line:90%
that night after his work.

00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So,
what's next for you?"

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.914 align:middle line:90%
And he says, "Next?

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:17.015 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean what's next?"

00:40:17.015 --> 00:40:19.551 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I
mean, what's your dream?

00:40:19.551 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:84%
What's your-- " and
he said, "I'm happy.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.754 align:middle line:90%
I've got a great family.

00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:23.989 align:middle line:90%
I've got great nice work."

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:25.056 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:26.458 align:middle line:84%
And I mean you don't
have to have a dream

00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:28.994 align:middle line:84%
but usually life sends signals
about something you would love

00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:31.162 align:middle line:90%
to create or bring forth.

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: This is your--

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yeah,
this is my own son.

00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:34.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is
his mother talking.

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:34.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: I know.

00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:36.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: This is mother talking.

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:37.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And he's like Mom,
what do you mean what's next."

00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I said,
"Well, if you could be

00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:41.206 align:middle line:90%
or do anything you wanted.

00:40:41.206 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, I'd like to have
a bigger house because I'm--

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.977 align:middle line:90%
we're cramped in here."

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:48.413 align:middle line:84%
So, they had bought
a piece of property

00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:51.616 align:middle line:90%
in Overhill with some savings.

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.618 align:middle line:84%
But he said, "We're going to
be able to build on that house

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:56.955 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
financing in Mexico."

00:40:56.955 --> 00:40:58.723 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You know,
we've saved up our money

00:40:58.723 --> 00:41:00.025 align:middle line:90%
and bought this house."

00:41:00.025 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But he said, "We're not in
camp-- there's no finance."

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.228 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:41:03.228 --> 00:41:05.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are the facts and
this is the challenge for any

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:08.433 align:middle line:84%
of us is the facts never
give you permission.

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:09.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No, yeah.

00:41:09.568 --> 00:41:10.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: You have
to get your permission

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:12.604 align:middle line:84%
from a different realm,
which is where Einstein went

00:41:12.604 --> 00:41:14.105 align:middle line:84%
to get his permission,
where Edison went

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:16.308 align:middle line:84%
to get his permission,
where Steve Jobs went

00:41:16.308 --> 00:41:17.709 align:middle line:90%
to get his permission.

00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:20.645 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's an innovator and
creates beyond the boundaries

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.381 align:middle line:84%
of what ordinary
people create know

00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:27.552 align:middle line:84%
that the mind they have the
idea in has a means to bring it

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:30.522 align:middle line:84%
about that the conditions
don't yet know about.

00:41:30.522 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The conditions are an effect of
the mindset that we've been in.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.362 align:middle line:84%
If we make an agreement,
it's going to be tough,

00:41:37.362 --> 00:41:38.697 align:middle line:90%
guess what it's going to be.

00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:40.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, I mean, a loan is
a perfect example.

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:41.466 align:middle line:90%
You've got banks.

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:42.367 align:middle line:90%
You've got rigid structures--

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:43.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: That's right.

00:41:43.435 --> 00:41:44.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- you've got
rules, you've got laws,

00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:45.537 align:middle line:90%
and there's no getting by those.

00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
that's absolutely right

00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:48.373 align:middle line:90%
as it exist right now.

00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:49.474 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, but what

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:52.444 align:middle line:84%
if there's some way
you don't know about?

00:41:52.444 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
What if there's a way that
you could build your house

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.383 align:middle line:84%
that isn't in the
ordinary way of thinking,

00:41:58.383 --> 00:41:59.618 align:middle line:90%
how would that occur?"

00:41:59.618 --> 00:42:00.952 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I have no
idea how that would occur."

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:02.554 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I know
how it would occur."

00:42:02.554 --> 00:42:03.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You do?

00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:04.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, I do.

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:06.658 align:middle line:84%
It occurs because
you do everything.

00:42:06.658 --> 00:42:09.594 align:middle line:84%
You keep the picture, you get
the picture clear in your mind

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:13.131 align:middle line:84%
and you do everything you
can do with what you do have,

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:15.433 align:middle line:84%
life does somethings
you can't make happen

00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:17.535 align:middle line:84%
but you've made welcome
because your work way

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:21.039 align:middle line:84%
up to a new frequency
of being, a new mindset.

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:23.642 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What could you
do with what you have?"

00:42:23.642 --> 00:42:26.011 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Well, we could--
if you love.."

00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:28.013 align:middle line:84%
So, he-- they loved it
in to their, you know,

00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:29.748 align:middle line:90%
a picture in their mind.

00:42:29.748 --> 00:42:33.018 align:middle line:84%
And he said well-- you
know, I call this--

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:34.953 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you think about
it many businesses,

00:42:34.953 --> 00:42:36.221 align:middle line:90%
many great things have started

00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:38.356 align:middle line:84%
out on cocktail napkins,
somebody at dinner said,

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:40.892 align:middle line:84%
"You know.." and they draw a
little picture of it.

00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you asked him
what it would look like.

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I asked him
what it would look like.

00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, he started drawing
some pictures of it.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, this is a picture
that was drawn on a napkin?

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes it was.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.403 align:middle line:90%
And he showed a picture of it.

00:42:51.403 --> 00:42:53.438 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So,
if you were serious

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:54.673 align:middle line:90%
about this, what would you do?"

00:42:54.673 --> 00:42:56.141 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, I
figured out where I'm going

00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:57.676 align:middle line:84%
to get a loan so I could
get the blueprints."

00:42:57.676 --> 00:42:59.144 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, how much are
the blueprints going to cost?"

00:42:59.144 --> 00:43:01.212 align:middle line:84%
He says, "15,000
dollars probably."

00:43:01.212 --> 00:43:03.348 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Do you
have 15,000 dollars?"

00:43:03.348 --> 00:43:04.549 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, I do, but
I'm not going to do it.

00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:06.651 align:middle line:84%
Why would I design-- why
would I put 15,000 dollars

00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:08.253 align:middle line:84%
into something I'm
not going to build?"

00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:09.421 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You'll
never build it

00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:11.456 align:middle line:90%
if you don't have a blueprint."

00:43:11.456 --> 00:43:13.024 align:middle line:90%
And he trusted me enough

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to do what he could
do with what he had.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.962 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- at first--
this is an important clue.

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:21.633 align:middle line:84%
They had the architect
draw design for what they--

00:43:21.633 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they could figure
out some way for this to happen.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And when they went in to see
the design, it was a draft

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.742 align:middle line:84%
and then he said, "If I'm
going to spend 15,000 dollars

00:43:30.742 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:84%
on a house I'm not going to
build, by golly, I'm going

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.212 align:middle line:84%
to spend it on a house
I would love to build.

00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:37.449 align:middle line:84%
And they stretched out the walls
and they heightened the ceilings

00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:40.185 align:middle line:84%
and they expanded and they built
a dream house in their mind

00:43:40.185 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and they built a
dream house on paper.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.954 align:middle line:90%
And so I--

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, they put it
all into that.

00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I've got the
dream house built on paper.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.425 align:middle line:84%
He called me and says, "I got
the dream house on paper."

00:43:47.425 --> 00:43:48.927 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "That's
your first big win."

00:43:48.927 --> 00:43:51.796 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
step was they--

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:52.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How long did
he sit on that for,

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.165 align:middle line:84%
and how long did he
look at that for?

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: It took
him about six months.

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:57.969 align:middle line:84%
No, it took him about six
months to do what he needed

00:43:57.969 --> 00:44:01.339 align:middle line:84%
to do to get his blueprint, put
it on his walls in his office.

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.307 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did he look
at it every day?

00:44:03.942 --> 00:44:04.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: He
put it on the walls

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:06.444 align:middle line:84%
in the office he
worked in every day.

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:07.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And then, he--
I said, "So, how's it going?"

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:11.983 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, I'm
looking at the pictures."

00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:13.818 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So, what could
you do with what you have?"

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:16.354 align:middle line:84%
"What do you want me
to do, sell my house?"

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:17.422 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So, how
much could you get

00:44:17.422 --> 00:44:18.256 align:middle line:90%
for your house you're in."

00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:19.657 align:middle line:90%
He said, "150,000 dollars."

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:20.759 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
what if you did

00:44:20.759 --> 00:44:22.594 align:middle line:84%
that what could you
build with that 150?"

00:44:22.594 --> 00:44:24.929 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Mom, I could
build a foundation."

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:25.897 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I wonder
what would happen

00:44:25.897 --> 00:44:27.832 align:middle line:90%
if you built a foundation?"

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:29.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my God.

00:44:29.067 --> 00:44:30.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: And so--

00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:33.772 align:middle line:84%
A week later, a guy walks in
his office who said, "You know,

00:44:33.772 --> 00:44:36.908 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for a little house
to invest in here in Cabo,

00:44:36.908 --> 00:44:38.643 align:middle line:90%
do you know anybody, a realtor?

00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:39.911 align:middle line:90%
John says, "Really?

00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:41.479 align:middle line:84%
Well, my wife and I are thinking
about selling our house.

00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure where we're
going to go with it."

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.283 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "Well, I'm
actually not going to move

00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:46.317 align:middle line:90%
down here for three years."

00:44:46.317 --> 00:44:47.352 align:middle line:90%
And John said, "Really."

00:44:47.352 --> 00:44:48.453 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "So,
you'd be interested

00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:49.888 align:middle line:84%
in renting the house
back if you bought it?"

00:44:49.888 --> 00:44:51.523 align:middle line:84%
"Oh yeah, I just
want to invest."

00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:52.524 align:middle line:90%
He went up.

00:44:52.524 --> 00:44:54.659 align:middle line:84%
They did a handshake
deal, 150,000.

00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:90%
He bought John and Dora's house.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.562 align:middle line:84%
They got to live
in it, and they put

00:44:57.562 --> 00:44:59.230 align:middle line:90%
that 150,000 into a foundation.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.499 align:middle line:84%
And that's Ricardo
standing in the space

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:03.601 align:middle line:90%
that would become his bedroom.

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:04.736 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:45:04.736 --> 00:45:05.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What?

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:06.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes.

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.339 align:middle line:84%
And John was going
up there every day

00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:11.109 align:middle line:84%
and he would take the family and
he'd walk around and imagine it

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:13.945 align:middle line:84%
into existent just like
I had walked in my mind

00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:16.548 align:middle line:84%
with that little boy who
became John in my hand

00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:19.150 align:middle line:84%
into kindergarten into his
graduation.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.853 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking his family
and they're enthusiastic.

00:45:21.853 --> 00:45:25.056 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he's up there
looking around at the foundation

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.991 align:middle line:84%
and talking with the
builders and it seemed

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:90%
that 150 turned into something.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.062 align:middle line:84%
And a guy drives by and
says, "What are you doing?"

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.463 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm building
my dream house."

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.498 align:middle line:90%
And he says, "Really?

00:45:33.498 --> 00:45:34.465 align:middle line:90%
Well, tell me about it."

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.533 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Let me walk
you through it."

00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:37.135 align:middle line:90%
He never met this guy before.

00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:42.073 align:middle line:84%
It turned out this guy, there
was a new-- it was experimental.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:46.511 align:middle line:84%
They were going to do
24 homes financing.

00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:49.214 align:middle line:84%
Not the final-- they knew a
final financing was coming

00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:51.816 align:middle line:84%
in that they were
doing an experiment

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:54.686 align:middle line:84%
it was... I'll think of
their names, one

00:45:54.686 --> 00:45:58.223 align:middle line:84%
of the major mortgage companies
in the U.S. This is 2006,

00:45:58.223 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:90%
this started.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:59.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:45:59.891 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So 2007,
now 2000s

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:02.894 align:middle line:90%
they got this far that in 2000--

00:46:02.894 --> 00:46:04.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So wait, they're
building this house

00:46:04.696 --> 00:46:06.731 align:middle line:84%
with not knowing how
they're going to get walls.

00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:07.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Absolutely.

00:46:07.532 --> 00:46:08.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You're kidding me?

00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:09.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: No,
I'm not, I'm not.

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:10.935 align:middle line:90%
Now, you have to be willing to--

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:12.737 align:middle line:84%
you have to be willing
to lose if you do this.

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, a
big leap of faith.

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:16.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Well, but
the foundation was going

00:46:16.875 --> 00:46:17.742 align:middle line:90%
to stay there.

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:19.077 align:middle line:90%
John did this with it.

00:46:19.077 --> 00:46:21.045 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You know, John, if
you get the foundation done

00:46:21.045 --> 00:46:24.449 align:middle line:84%
and it takes three more years or
five more years, who you become

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:26.451 align:middle line:84%
at the end and who
you're becoming

00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:84%
as you do this is way more
than if you sat and waited

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.021 align:middle line:90%
for something to happen.

00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:31.155 align:middle line:90%
You're building your dream.

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:33.358 align:middle line:84%
You get to own that
I'm building my dream.

00:46:33.358 --> 00:46:34.926 align:middle line:84%
It might take longer
than I would prefer

00:46:34.926 --> 00:46:36.327 align:middle line:90%
but I'm building my dream."

00:46:36.327 --> 00:46:38.429 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, this
guy says, "You know,

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:42.467 align:middle line:84%
there's this mortgage coming
in that, you know, where--

00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:43.902 align:middle line:84%
Gold and Sachs, that's
who it was--

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:47.639 align:middle line:84%
is bringing some financing
in and we're looking for people

00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:50.975 align:middle line:84%
that have built-- and they
will only give you financing

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:52.844 align:middle line:84%
if you've built three
quarters done.

00:46:52.844 --> 00:46:54.212 align:middle line:84%
You have to get complete
framing, roof

00:46:54.212 --> 00:46:57.148 align:middle line:84%
work everything three quarters
done, then they'll finance.

00:46:57.148 --> 00:46:59.651 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "We're
doing Angel loans

00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:01.152 align:middle line:84%
to help people get
three quarters done."

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:03.655 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- there's a pretty
stringent dah, dah, dah, but--

00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:04.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What are the odds?

00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:06.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: He said
what are the odds?

00:47:06.224 --> 00:47:09.727 align:middle line:84%
See, at the end of the day,
odds are statistics only applied

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:13.031 align:middle line:84%
to groups, not one
of us is a statistic.

00:47:13.031 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You're either on the frequency
of your dream or you're off

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.703 align:middle line:84%
waiting for something else to
happen out there, maybe someday.

00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:20.305 align:middle line:90%
And so he shows up.

00:47:20.305 --> 00:47:23.374 align:middle line:84%
You can't make it happen
but you can make it welcome

00:47:23.374 --> 00:47:25.576 align:middle line:84%
by being a magnetic attraction
for the thing you want.

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What about
the fear and the doubt?

00:47:27.712 --> 00:47:28.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:29.647 align:middle line:84%
Here's the deal on
the daily basis--

00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:30.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Risk.

00:47:30.748 --> 00:47:31.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- you
have to feed your faith

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.518 align:middle line:90%
and starve your doubt.

00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:34.852 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, it's not easy.

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:39.157 align:middle line:84%
On occasion doubt-- and you
go, I'm building this dream.

00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:40.258 align:middle line:90%
It might take longer

00:47:40.258 --> 00:47:42.093 align:middle line:84%
than I would prefer,
we're going to be OK.

00:47:42.093 --> 00:47:44.462 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wouldn't--
there was no worry

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:46.397 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't have
a roof over their head.

00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:47.832 align:middle line:84%
That he didn't put
his family at risk.

00:47:47.832 --> 00:47:48.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:50.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: There is
no worry about that.

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:53.371 align:middle line:84%
He had the opportunity at a
certain point in his life.

00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:55.573 align:middle line:84%
And almost every one of
us has an opportunity

00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:57.241 align:middle line:84%
to do something more
than we've been doing

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:90%
with our current circumstances.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:47:59.978 align:middle line:90%
Regardless the next-- you'll see

00:47:59.978 --> 00:48:01.579 align:middle line:84%
in the next picture
they got it done.

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:03.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: The next
picture is done.

00:48:03.815 --> 00:48:05.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So they
got the Angel money.

00:48:05.283 --> 00:48:07.585 align:middle line:84%
And then they-- so they
build it to three quarters,

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:09.954 align:middle line:84%
at which point they went in
to sign the papers on the loan

00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:11.956 align:middle line:84%
and the guys said, "You
got to know something.

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:13.191 align:middle line:90%
They shut this program down.

00:48:13.191 --> 00:48:16.094 align:middle line:84%
You are the last
loan in Mexico."

00:48:16.094 --> 00:48:19.564 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, there's never
been financing in Mexico since.

00:48:19.564 --> 00:48:21.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, he got that window?

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:24.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And he was the
last loan before Gold and Sachs

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:25.069 align:middle line:90%
stopped doing Mexico.

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:27.238 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me, "Imagine mom.

00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.807 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't done what I could
do at the moment I could do it,

00:48:29.807 --> 00:48:34.312 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been ready to
receive the one-time opening."

00:48:34.312 --> 00:48:35.747 align:middle line:90%
There was a little open window.

00:48:35.747 --> 00:48:37.615 align:middle line:90%
I was there at the right moment.

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:38.916 align:middle line:84%
He said, "How did
you know that?"

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.018 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I didn't know that."

00:48:40.018 --> 00:48:41.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You didn't know that.

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I didn't
know the specifics.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.989 align:middle line:84%
I know though and I've come over
years to see it over and over

00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:47.258 align:middle line:84%
and over again that if you have
a dream in your mind and you're

00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:50.661 align:middle line:84%
in love with it and you do what
you can do with what you do have

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and take the steps
you can take--

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: One step at a time
is what really getting here.

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: -- that life
does some things you can't make

00:48:55.566 --> 00:48:57.301 align:middle line:84%
happen but you made
them welcome.

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Do you feel--

00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and here's the picture
of his beautiful home,

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.707 align:middle line:84%
which is stunning and
there's incredible pictures

00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:03.574 align:middle line:90%
of the house.

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:04.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:05.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But, this is what I--

00:49:05.743 --> 00:49:08.613 align:middle line:84%
my question is, this picture
here where he's in the pool

00:49:08.613 --> 00:49:11.816 align:middle line:84%
it's an infinity pool,
overlooking the ocean in Mexico

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
with his two beautiful-- three
children, I think are there,

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.024 align:middle line:84%
does it take purpose in
order to make these things?

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:22.894 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
the missing ingredient

00:49:22.894 --> 00:49:24.929 align:middle line:84%
or I should say the
main ingredient

00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle line:90%
to make these things happen?

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:30.168 align:middle line:84%
That he wanted-- he wanted
space, he wanted expansion,

00:49:30.168 --> 00:49:31.536 align:middle line:90%
he wanted-- he had purpose.

00:49:31.536 --> 00:49:33.704 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:36.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yes, I
love-- purpose is--

00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:38.443 align:middle line:90%
we're in a spiral universe.

00:49:38.443 --> 00:49:40.945 align:middle line:84%
So, there's ever-- in every
turn of the spot, there's a pull

00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:43.147 align:middle line:84%
to the more in
every one of us in every blade

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:46.250 align:middle line:84%
of grass and every-- all of
us, there's a pull to the more.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.618 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
the pull

00:49:47.618 --> 00:49:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of the contraction
of the familiar.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Sure, sure.

00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:51.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So you-- we
danced between those polarities.

00:49:51.756 --> 00:49:53.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Sometimes
that's stronger.

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:55.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: In particular, if
we pay attention to it can be--

00:49:55.426 --> 00:49:57.128 align:middle line:90%
it's like-- it's huge, you know?

00:49:57.128 --> 00:49:58.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:49:58.396 --> 00:49:59.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yeah, so that's
why you feed your faith

00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:90%
and you starve your fear.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.167 align:middle line:90%
The purpose is the fire.

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you want
water to turn into steam,

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.572 align:middle line:84%
you got to have some
fire underneath it,

00:50:07.572 --> 00:50:10.808 align:middle line:84%
when Napoleon Hill talked
about a burning desire.

00:50:10.808 --> 00:50:14.979 align:middle line:84%
So, you have-- it has to be
that this matters so much to you

00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:17.448 align:middle line:84%
that you're willing to love
it right into existence

00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:20.084 align:middle line:84%
with what you have as best
you can from where you are.

00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
If the first phase of
what you can do is turn it

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.755 align:middle line:90%
into a paper version of itself.

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:27.792 align:middle line:84%
Then love that into at least a
foundation of itself and then

00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:29.393 align:middle line:90%
at least a wall of itself.

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:33.397 align:middle line:84%
Do what you can do with what you
have and watch new ideas come.

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.966 align:middle line:90%
Things start to show up.

00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:36.868 align:middle line:84%
Things change because
you've change.

00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:38.936 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, you
can't make anything happen

00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:41.539 align:middle line:84%
but you can make it welcome
by you doing what you can do.

00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:43.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Is it ever too late?

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:45.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: No, it
is never too late.

00:50:45.443 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
That's Dorothy Manin, my
mother on her 92nd birthday.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.515 align:middle line:90%
>>Lisa: I love how you

00:50:50.515 --> 00:50:52.083 align:middle line:84%
use your family
members as your examples

00:50:52.083 --> 00:50:53.417 align:middle line:90%
because it's perfect.

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I got so on
fire with this that my family

00:50:55.186 --> 00:50:56.854 align:middle line:84%
at first was just
like, "Oh, my God."

00:50:56.854 --> 00:50:58.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, and that's people
that you would actually--

00:50:58.723 --> 00:50:59.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:50:59.824 --> 00:51:01.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- ever talk
to about this, yeah.

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And my mother--
I mean, I was in this for many,

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.928 align:middle line:84%
many years and after my
father died, my mother went

00:51:03.928 --> 00:51:05.663 align:middle line:84%
into a deep funk
for about six months

00:51:05.663 --> 00:51:07.932 align:middle line:84%
and then one day called
me and said, "All right.

00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:09.267 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I'm
still breathing,

00:51:09.267 --> 00:51:11.035 align:middle line:84%
there's probably something I
should be doing with my life

00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:14.739 align:middle line:84%
and let me take one of
those programs you do."

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:17.742 align:middle line:90%
And we just started

00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:19.577 align:middle line:84%
with something--
there's nothing I love.

00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:20.611 align:middle line:90%
There's not-- I love your dad."

00:51:20.611 --> 00:51:21.813 align:middle line:90%
It's like that.

00:51:21.813 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Is there anything
you've ever entertained

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.982 align:middle line:84%
that might even be
a little bit of fun.

00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:26.717 align:middle line:84%
And let's just take
a baby step."

00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, she began to take
a china painting class.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.755 align:middle line:84%
So that turned into--
and all want to say is

00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:32.957 align:middle line:84%
that over the next
seven years of her life,

00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:37.762 align:middle line:84%
from 85 to 92 was the most
creative, generative period

00:51:37.762 --> 00:51:41.766 align:middle line:84%
of her life because she was
willing to learn the system that

00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:43.668 align:middle line:84%
unlocks and unleashes the power
each one of us have

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:46.671 align:middle line:84%
to live a life we love living
in a way that matters to us.

00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:48.372 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will love
it the same way.

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:51.375 align:middle line:84%
She long-- she wrote a book-- at
her 90th birth, we celebrate--

00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We have a
picture of the book here.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:53.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:54.679 align:middle line:90%
Put a Zip in Your Day.

00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:55.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I love it. Put a Zip in
Your--

00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:57.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Anyways-- I
have to put a zip

00:51:57.348 --> 00:51:59.851 align:middle line:84%
in your day and all of which she
has tried and done by the way.

00:51:59.851 --> 00:52:00.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And what age is she?

00:52:00.918 --> 00:52:03.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: That
was her 90th birthday.

00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:04.322 align:middle line:90%
She printed that.

00:52:04.322 --> 00:52:06.724 align:middle line:84%
She sold bunches of them
and she started a nonprofit.

00:52:06.724 --> 00:52:09.327 align:middle line:90%
With that to give microloans.

00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:11.996 align:middle line:84%
She did microlending
for Northwest veterans

00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:14.599 align:middle line:84%
who had been impacted by
the Iraq-Afghanistan War.

00:52:14.599 --> 00:52:15.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:17.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Because she had
been impacted with World War II

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:18.336 align:middle line:84%
with my dad having to been
gone and the Korean War

00:52:18.336 --> 00:52:20.204 align:middle line:84%
with my dad having to been
gone-- having been gone.

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:21.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, she had a
place in heart for that?

00:52:21.973 --> 00:52:23.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Another woman
marrying Woodman,

00:52:23.341 --> 00:52:27.812 align:middle line:84%
who is 87 there and-- well,
when somebody asked her, "So,

00:52:27.812 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
would you like to get
married at this point?"

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.249 align:middle line:84%
She said, "No, I don't
think I want to get married

00:52:31.249 --> 00:52:32.383 align:middle line:84%
but a little loose living,
that'd be good."

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:33.651 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.755 align:middle line:84%
And what I love is, you know,
we think sometimes people

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:84%
in older bodies have-- or
any of us that sort of thing.

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:43.694 align:middle line:84%
Then, lot-- as long as life
is breathing as it wants

00:52:43.694 --> 00:52:47.031 align:middle line:84%
to express itself and it will
always give us a new dream.

00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:49.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, your
steps are in this--

00:52:49.367 --> 00:52:51.969 align:middle line:84%
the dream builder steps is the
way that you talk to people

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:55.139 align:middle line:84%
about and you can download
that free on your website.

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yes.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: There's worksheets you
can work through, which is great

00:52:57.909 --> 00:53:00.544 align:middle line:84%
because I appreciate you help
us ask the right questions.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Thank you.

00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:02.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Through your
years of experience,

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.516 align:middle line:84%
where we would just normally
get completely stuck you give us

00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:07.451 align:middle line:90%
a framework from which to work.

00:53:07.451 --> 00:53:09.987 align:middle line:84%
So, you're saying
that just to create--

00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:11.689 align:middle line:84%
there's a few steps
on that dream builder

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:13.858 align:middle line:84%
that you have here,
finding point A--

00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: That's right.

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:15.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- and really,

00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:18.062 align:middle line:84%
really getting clear
about what you want.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:21.198 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, there's a
for sale, and if you trying

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:23.267 align:middle line:84%
to sell your house, get
a picture, put it out--

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:24.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: That's right.

00:53:24.268 --> 00:53:25.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- just
like a vision board--

00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: That's right.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- do that, right?

00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:28.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: In this
particular PowerPoint was

00:53:28.139 --> 00:53:29.507 align:middle line:84%
about a house we wanted
to sell at a time

00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:31.142 align:middle line:90%
when the housing market was down

00:53:31.142 --> 00:53:33.477 align:middle line:84%
and no one believed we
could sell a house.

00:53:33.477 --> 00:53:34.979 align:middle line:84%
And I'd looked at my husband,
I said, "We're either going

00:53:34.979 --> 00:53:37.014 align:middle line:84%
to make an agreement with
circumstance or we're going

00:53:37.014 --> 00:53:38.683 align:middle line:84%
to make an agreement
with vision."

00:53:38.683 --> 00:53:42.119 align:middle line:84%
And here's the truth, it only
takes one and what if it's easy.

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:44.488 align:middle line:84%
And so, we kept hooking to that
idea that it only takes one

00:53:44.488 --> 00:53:47.258 align:middle line:84%
and what if it's easy and
I-- we made a decision.

00:53:47.258 --> 00:53:49.026 align:middle line:84%
We're selling our
house to somebody

00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:50.995 align:middle line:84%
who loves our house
the way we've loved it

00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:52.830 align:middle line:84%
at a fair price we
all feel good about.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.665 align:middle line:84%
It just takes one and
what if it's easy.

00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:56.067 align:middle line:84%
But we were planning
to put our house

00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:57.401 align:middle line:84%
on the market the
following week.

00:53:57.401 --> 00:54:00.438 align:middle line:84%
The day where we just kept
saying that, drawing, agreeing,

00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:02.139 align:middle line:84%
and we-- you know, it's
like, doing our best

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:04.108 align:middle line:84%
and not pay attention to all
the houses in our neighborhood

00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:06.877 align:middle line:84%
that were going down, down,
down in price and say, "Well."

00:54:06.877 --> 00:54:09.146 align:middle line:84%
And be willing to
stay on the frequency

00:54:09.146 --> 00:54:10.214 align:middle line:90%
of what we were dreaming.

00:54:10.214 --> 00:54:11.415 align:middle line:90%
Stay on the mindset.

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:13.551 align:middle line:84%
It could happen and really--
there is that there--

00:54:13.551 --> 00:54:14.719 align:middle line:90%
in all the possibilities--

00:54:14.719 --> 00:54:15.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It only takes one--

00:54:15.653 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And
what it's easy?

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- and what
if it's easy.

00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:19.023 align:middle line:90%
That's a great phrase.

00:54:19.023 --> 00:54:20.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Why not
have it be that way?

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:21.225 align:middle line:84%
Since I'm going to
make it up anyway,

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:22.693 align:middle line:90%
let me make it up for that way.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:25.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And the day we're
moving out, somebody knocks

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:26.664 align:middle line:84%
on the door and says,
"You're moving out?

00:54:26.664 --> 00:54:28.065 align:middle line:90%
We heard you had the best yard.

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:29.433 align:middle line:84%
Can we see your house?"
I said,

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:30.968 align:middle line:84%
"You know what your house looks
like when you're moving out?"

00:54:30.968 --> 00:54:32.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:34.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And how that
woman knocked on my door--

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and our door is because
my husband had gone

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.476 align:middle line:84%
out to get the mail the
very last time that day

00:54:38.476 --> 00:54:40.711 align:middle line:84%
and Caroline, it's in a culdesac
neighborhood we were in.

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.748 align:middle line:84%
She pushes a stroller and she
says, "Joe, you're moving."

00:54:43.748 --> 00:54:45.116 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, I know."

00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:46.517 align:middle line:84%
"We love the neighborhood,"
tell him about the new house.

00:54:46.517 --> 00:54:48.386 align:middle line:84%
"What do you do with
this house?"

00:54:48.386 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is,
"We're selling this house.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.288 align:middle line:84%
Would you know somebody
who wants to live

00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:52.723 align:middle line:90%
in this great neighborhood?"

00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:55.092 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, "You
know, I think I do."

00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:56.060 align:middle line:90%
She calls them.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.128 align:middle line:84%
They come, they knock
on the door.

00:54:57.128 --> 00:54:59.163 align:middle line:84%
They buy the house,
fair price.

00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:00.164 align:middle line:90%
They love the house.

00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:01.499 align:middle line:84%
To this day we see them at
Christmas and...

00:55:01.499 --> 00:55:05.603 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we were thinking about
selling the house or thinking,

00:55:05.603 --> 00:55:07.338 align:middle line:90%
"Well, at least give a try,"

00:55:07.338 --> 00:55:09.206 align:middle line:90%
when she asking what would you--

00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:11.275 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing
with the house?

00:55:11.275 --> 00:55:14.478 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't say I'm--
we're selling it.

00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:16.680 align:middle line:84%
He would say, "Well, we're going
to try to sell it," because--

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.448 align:middle line:90%
but you know, the market.

00:55:17.448 --> 00:55:18.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:19.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: And then they have
a conversation about the market.

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:20.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right, right.

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Because
he was saying,

00:55:21.452 --> 00:55:23.020 align:middle line:90%
"We're selling the house."

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:26.891 align:middle line:84%
The idea he gets on I'm selling
the house is a different idea

00:55:26.891 --> 00:55:30.027 align:middle line:84%
than the idea he'll get if
he's trying to sell the house.

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:32.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And the market
conversation takes it

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.030 align:middle line:90%
in endless.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Completely.

00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:36.133 align:middle line:84%
And she knows somebody who
would love to buy the house

00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:39.570 align:middle line:84%
but you can't find that on--
you can't find Discovery on CNN.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.671 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be there.

00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:41.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:55:41.472 --> 00:55:42.606 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be there,

00:55:42.606 --> 00:55:44.008 align:middle line:84%
It'll be the Discovery
Channel, that's right.

00:55:44.008 --> 00:55:45.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:55:45.042 --> 00:55:46.076 align:middle line:84%
You can't find Gaiam
on the CNN, yeah.

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness. So
look, it sold.

00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:48.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So,
it's sold, of course.

00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:49.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that's amazing.

00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:50.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:51.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, back to the whole
fish bowl idea is

00:55:51.982 --> 00:55:54.251 align:middle line:84%
that there is something bigger
out there for all of us,

00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:58.722 align:middle line:84%
we just need to-- there is
one, why not make it easy?

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.658 align:middle line:84%
I've got write down all the
things that you said.

00:56:00.658 --> 00:56:01.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:56:01.492 --> 00:56:02.493 align:middle line:90%
And actually it's not really--

00:56:02.493 --> 00:56:03.627 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but there is
something bigger.

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:05.262 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily out there.

00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:09.066 align:middle line:84%
It will be out there if we
get it really strong in here.

00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:11.902 align:middle line:84%
So, just a really good
place to start and a place

00:56:11.902 --> 00:56:13.137 align:middle line:90%
that most people don't allow,

00:56:13.137 --> 00:56:17.208 align:middle line:84%
we spend on average more
time planning a weekend trip

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:19.610 align:middle line:84%
than we spend planning a
life we would love living.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:20.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's a good point.

00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:23.347 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Actually, I didn't get
to the step two and three

00:56:23.347 --> 00:56:24.782 align:middle line:90%
of the dream builder toolkit.

00:56:24.782 --> 00:56:26.917 align:middle line:90%
Step two was designing the dream

00:56:26.917 --> 00:56:29.653 align:middle line:84%
and painting point
B, visioning it.

00:56:29.653 --> 00:56:30.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: That's
right, yeah.

00:56:30.454 --> 00:56:31.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, visioning it.

00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:34.358 align:middle line:84%
And then, step three
is what is your "why."

00:56:34.358 --> 00:56:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Yes, when
you ask your purpose.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.529 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want-- why do
you want the bigger house?

00:56:38.529 --> 00:56:39.797 align:middle line:90%
I want my family healthy.

00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:42.266 align:middle line:84%
I want to have some room
where I can, you know, express

00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:44.602 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted his own
private office and he wanted

00:56:44.602 --> 00:56:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to have a place where he
could be quiet if he want to

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.205 align:middle line:90%
and be noisy if he wanted to.

00:56:48.205 --> 00:56:50.774 align:middle line:84%
He wanted his kids to have
room to run, play, and not jump

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:53.644 align:middle line:84%
on each other and trip
on each other and a place

00:56:53.644 --> 00:56:55.079 align:middle line:84%
where they could
entertain and have guest

00:56:55.079 --> 00:57:00.484 align:middle line:84%
and the why is what life looks
like unleashed and it has

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to be something that when
you feel it inside yourself,

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.255 align:middle line:90%
you do go, "I would love that."

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, do you take all
of those things, that vision

00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:07.958 align:middle line:90%
that you just mentioned.

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:11.629 align:middle line:84%
Write that down and vision
that out five minutes a day,

00:57:11.629 --> 00:57:13.097 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes a day, is that--

00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:15.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: The visioning
in the morning is meant

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:16.700 align:middle line:90%
to help you ask some questions.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.370 align:middle line:84%
When you get on your
computer, you just--

00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:22.006 align:middle line:84%
the whole internet is available
to you but the only thing

00:57:22.006 --> 00:57:25.209 align:middle line:84%
that comes to you was what you
tell it you're interested in.

00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:27.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: So--
And that you learn

00:57:27.044 --> 00:57:28.379 align:middle line:90%
to ask a really good question

00:57:28.379 --> 00:57:30.581 align:middle line:84%
because the search engines
cannot give you a quality answer

00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:32.049 align:middle line:84%
if you don't ask a
really good question.

00:57:32.049 --> 00:57:35.319 align:middle line:84%
I asked it one day, movie
theaters in Seaside,

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:36.954 align:middle line:90%
I was 10 miles from Seaside.

00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:39.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, how many seasides in
the world there are?

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:41.559 align:middle line:90%
I had to say Seaside, Oregon.

00:57:41.559 --> 00:57:42.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Then boom!

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.295 align:middle line:84%
That movie theater,
the address, the times

00:57:44.295 --> 00:57:45.462 align:middle line:84%
and their movies
were right there.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.697 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:48.799 align:middle line:84%
So, in the morning, when
you're visioning, part of--

00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:51.268 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself in it,
you're-- but what could I do?

00:57:51.268 --> 00:57:53.203 align:middle line:84%
So, when I'm seeing
myself walk my little boy

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.606 align:middle line:84%
into kindergarten and
nothing is happening,

00:57:55.606 --> 00:57:57.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm barely able to-- you know,
it's like what could I do?

00:57:57.942 --> 00:57:59.476 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could I sign
up for a class.

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.946 align:middle line:84%
Today, I could sign up for a
class in September. This was

00:58:01.946 --> 00:58:05.115 align:middle line:84%
the end of July and I'm starting
to look a little better.

00:58:05.115 --> 00:58:06.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, and you-- ?

00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:07.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I could
sign up for class.

00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:10.554 align:middle line:84%
I may waste that 30 bucks or
whatever I put as a down payment

00:58:10.554 --> 00:58:13.924 align:middle line:84%
on so I start to-- I
do the thing I can do.

00:58:13.924 --> 00:58:15.926 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the questioning in
the morning but what could I do

00:58:15.926 --> 00:58:18.729 align:middle line:84%
with what I have to at least
take a step in the direction

00:58:18.729 --> 00:58:20.664 align:middle line:90%
of my dream, and it's amazing.

00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:24.001 align:middle line:84%
If you will take those steps,
what starts to show up.

00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:24.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I can see--

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:25.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Yeah.

00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- how you
help people make their--

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.138 align:middle line:84%
turn their possibilities
into realities.

00:58:28.138 --> 00:58:28.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: I do.

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:30.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Thank you so much.

00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:31.308 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back and
watch a replay of the show,

00:58:31.308 --> 00:58:33.978 align:middle line:84%
right everything that
you said because you are

00:58:33.978 --> 00:58:36.547 align:middle line:84%
so inspirational
and so motivational.

00:58:36.547 --> 00:58:37.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Thank you.

00:58:37.214 --> 00:58:37.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Thank you.

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:38.949 align:middle line:90%
I would like to--

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:39.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I've a
line, Lisa.

00:58:39.717 --> 00:58:40.784 align:middle line:90%
It's just that inspiration

00:58:40.784 --> 00:58:42.186 align:middle line:84%
without action is
merely entertainment.

00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:44.288 align:middle line:84%
The entertainment is good but
it doesn't change your life.

00:58:44.288 --> 00:58:45.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: True, so do it.

00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:47.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: I hope
people would do something

00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:49.126 align:middle line:84%
with what they heard
today and take one step,

00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:51.428 align:middle line:84%
anyway baby steps will take you
all the way up on Mount Everest

00:58:51.428 --> 00:58:52.329 align:middle line:90%
if we just keep taking them.

00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:53.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yup, absolutely.

00:58:53.397 --> 00:58:55.032 align:middle line:84%
It's baby steps that
makes you get there

00:58:55.032 --> 00:58:57.901 align:middle line:84%
and it is definitely an
inspiration on your part--

00:58:57.901 --> 00:58:58.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Morrissey: Thank you.

00:58:58.936 --> 00:58:59.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- but definitely
take action.

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.572 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being here.

00:59:01.572 --> 00:59:02.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Morrissey: Thank
you. You're amazing.

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.407 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

00:59:03.407 --> 00:59:04.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And thank you
