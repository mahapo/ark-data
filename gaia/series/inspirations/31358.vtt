Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
shift your space

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.593 align:middle line:84%
and your energy in
regards to money?

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:27.661 align:middle line:84%
Is your money situation
everything that you want it

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.264 align:middle line:84%
to be or would you like to
clear any energy that you have

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.902 align:middle line:84%
around money and really,
truly create more space

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.637 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to money?

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Dr. Dain Heer,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.075 align:middle line:84%
the co-creator Access
Consciousness taught

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.879 align:middle line:84%
around the world in over 40
countries for the past 15 years

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.616 align:middle line:84%
and author of, " Being
You, Changing the World ."

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome. Hello.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.384 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.418 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Thanks for having me.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.052 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:52.853 align:middle line:90%
Great to be back.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:53.888 align:middle line:90%
I know, great to be back.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.022 align:middle line:84%
I know, we had so
much fun last time.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.157 align:middle line:90%
There's more to cover.

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's definitely
more to cover.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:57.858 align:middle line:90%
There's so much more to cover.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.026 align:middle line:90%
Especially on this subject.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.428 align:middle line:84%
What does being you
have to do with money?

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.532 align:middle line:90%
Money follows joy.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.934 align:middle line:84%
Joy doesn't follow
money, which is kind

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.034 align:middle line:90%
of an interesting concept.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You always hear joy
follows money, right.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.406 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because what you think is
once I get enough money then I

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.641 align:middle line:90%
can finally be happy.

00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:15.976 align:middle line:84%
Now once you make the demand
I'm going to be happy,

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.012 align:middle line:84%
then the money shows
up to support

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:19.246 align:middle line:90%
that showing up in your life.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.447 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.216 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's based on the
idea that your point

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
of view creates your reality.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.653 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't create
your point of view.

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.321 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have somebody
who experiences --

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, there
was a guy who experienced --

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.159 align:middle line:84%
there was this news show
right after Hurricane Andrew.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.696 align:middle line:84%
And there was a man standing
there, he was in 70s,

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:84%
and he was standing
there in his underwear.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.831 align:middle line:84%
The person who interviewing
him, "Sir,

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
what's your story,
what happened?"

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Well, came down here,

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.871 align:middle line:84%
used to own that
house right there,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.472 align:middle line:90%
and as you see it's just a slab.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.575 align:middle line:84%
I had all my worldly
possessions in it and this is

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:49.944 align:middle line:84%
where I was going to
retire and now it's gone."

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:51.611 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, "How
are you about this?"

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:84%
He went, "Well, I'm
okay, I still got me."

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:84%
Wow, now that [laughter] point
of view created him being able

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.455 align:middle line:84%
to move on and actually create
a life even though his house

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.623 align:middle line:84%
and all of his worldly
possessions...

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:84%
Wow. ...and all of
his money were gone.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
There were lots of people
interviewed on the same show

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.461 align:middle line:84%
that were angry at
God, angry at the world

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.863 align:middle line:90%
for taking their house away.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.266 align:middle line:84%
Those people are going to have
a much harder time moving on.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.534 align:middle line:90%
How could this happen to me.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.537 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Yeah, I -- I could
understand that though.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:18.239 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely and you could.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.674 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is though,
what you want to look at is

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
if my point of view
creates my reality what

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.144 align:middle line:84%
if I could shift
my points of view

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:84%
so I could have a
different reality.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.382 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what Access
Consciousness is about.

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:29.717 align:middle line:84%
Let's shift those
points of view.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:31.719 align:middle line:84%
Let's take those
things that don't work

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.088 align:middle line:90%
for us and let's undo them.

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:35.823 align:middle line:84%
Let's change to something
different.

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:39.193 align:middle line:84%
So if you realize -- and the
way it works is really cool.

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.595 align:middle line:84%
A lot of think, "Oh, I've got
to have the right point of view

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.364 align:middle line:84%
or the perfect point of
view, or I've got to be right

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:44.832 align:middle line:84%
in all this stuff
that I'm doing."

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.667 align:middle line:84%
No, if you're in one
of those situations,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.836 align:middle line:84%
something like that happens
to you and you realize,

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:49.703 align:middle line:90%
"Wow, I'm getting angry.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.038 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting resentful."

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, how about if
you change it.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.975 align:middle line:84%
Rather than I'm getting
angry and resentful,

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.044 align:middle line:84%
and I have to stay with it,
what about I'm getting angry

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.413 align:middle line:84%
and resentful, but I'd like to
be a lot more like that guy.

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:00.681 align:middle line:90%
How do I get there?

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.449 align:middle line:84%
So we don't' usually have
a model of that though.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.953 align:middle line:84%
Like the judgments that
I have about myself

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and my current view, I'm not
usually aware of the fact

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.259 align:middle line:90%
that that is limiting.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.162 align:middle line:90%
Right, and that is partially

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:84%
because of what we
were handed as kids.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.999 align:middle line:84%
You know, we saw our
parents acting a certain way.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.568 align:middle line:84%
We saw our grandparents and our
friends acting a certain way.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And we grow up and
we act that way.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.007 align:middle line:84%
And we act like that's us, but
if you had different parents

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and grandparents, you'd be
acting a different way so is

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.513 align:middle line:84%
that really you or is that
how you learned to be here,

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:36.016 align:middle line:84%
rather than you choosing to
be how you would like to be.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
That man, the old guy in the
shorts who had him and was happy

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.757 align:middle line:84%
with it, chose his
own path in the world

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:84%
and that's a great
example of how we could be

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.394 align:middle line:90%
if we would like choose it.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle line:84%
But it's like you said, we
don't have very many role

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.497 align:middle line:90%
models Uh-uh.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.699 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have to
do really for those of us

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.802 align:middle line:84%
who are actually seeking
and looking for change,

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:59.273 align:middle line:84%
we have to realize we've sort of
got to be the role model for us

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.343 align:middle line:84%
and also when you do that, you
end up becoming a role model

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:04.311 align:middle line:84%
or an inspiration
for other people.

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.913 align:middle line:84%
So what, do you just
question everything?

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:08.916 align:middle line:84%
You question every
belief that you have?

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:09.917 align:middle line:90%
Personally, yes.

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:10.718 align:middle line:90%
You do, okay.

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:11.552 align:middle line:90%
Yeah because I want to know.

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:12.853 align:middle line:90%
It's a great way to start, huh?

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.855 align:middle line:84%
Is it actually mine or is
it a judgment that I picked

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:16.857 align:middle line:84%
up along the way, or is it
actually somebody else's point

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:17.791 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.093 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
things we talked

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:21.495 align:middle line:84%
about last time is the idea
that 98% of your thoughts,

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.531 align:middle line:84%
your feelings, and your emotions
don't actually belong to you.

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
They actually belong to the
people around you and you're

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.268 align:middle line:84%
like a big psychic
radio receiver

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.237 align:middle line:84%
and you've been picking
it up your whole life,

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.474 align:middle line:84%
which means that 98% of the
unhappiness, 98% of the sadness,

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:37.111 align:middle line:84%
98% of the anger, 98%
of the money struggle,

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.213 align:middle line:84%
98% of the feeling
that you can't do it

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:84%
and can't create the life you
want, isn't actually yours.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.952 align:middle line:84%
You're so psychically
aware of those energies

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.654 align:middle line:84%
that you pick them up like
a big psychic radio receiver

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.256 align:middle line:84%
and you've been thinking
they're yours your whole life.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Right, of course.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.458 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And if that
weren't there...

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.328 align:middle line:84%
So good question --
where would I be, right?

00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:54.962 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:55.929 align:middle line:90%
Where would I be?

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.765 align:middle line:84%
So you start off
by asking yourself,

00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.099 align:middle line:90%
who does this belong to?

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.269 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and in actuality if
you'll do that for three days

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:03.871 align:middle line:84%
to every thought,
feeling, emotion...

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.241 align:middle line:84%
Okay. ...judgment, heaviness,
or point of view you have

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.576 align:middle line:84%
for three days, literally
for everything that takes you

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:13.347 align:middle line:84%
out of being space into,
"Eh," every single thing,

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:84%
if you ask who does this belong
to, if it lightens up at all,

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.085 align:middle line:84%
it's not yours, return
it to sender.

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:22.156 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, you don't even
have to know who the sender is.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.957 align:middle line:84%
Right. You just want to
give it back to the person

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.994 align:middle line:84%
who originally created it
so they can work on it,

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.496 align:middle line:84%
so you're not working on all
kinds of other people's stuff.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.032 align:middle line:84%
What if it's the
media, the social norm?

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:34.501 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be the media and
social norm, but you still have

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.937 align:middle line:84%
to align and agree if you're
going to walk home with it.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:37.971 align:middle line:90%
You still have to buy it

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:39.273 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
walk home with it.

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:43.043 align:middle line:84%
Uh-hum. What happens is with
this is once you do this,

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:44.745 align:middle line:84%
literally, if you'll do
this, who does this belong

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:47.381 align:middle line:84%
to for three days, you'll walk
around a city like Los Angeles

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.184 align:middle line:84%
or New York like walking,
talking meditation.

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.286 align:middle line:84%
You'll literally have no
thoughts in your head.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.188 align:middle line:84%
You'll just literally
have a sense of space,

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
no matter who's around, no
matter what you're doing.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.591 align:middle line:90%
Wow. Yeah.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.695 align:middle line:84%
The four basic statements
that I remember when I'm --

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.466 align:middle line:84%
when I'm familiarizing myself
with Access Consciousness is

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:08.202 align:middle line:84%
who does it belong
to for me, what --

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:12.973 align:middle line:84%
what doesn't make me feel
lighter makes me feel heavier.

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle line:90%
Redo that one [laughter].

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.476 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what's true
makes you feel lighter.

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
What's true makes
you feel lighter.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.144 align:middle line:90%
A lie makes you feel heavier.

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.479 align:middle line:90%
Lie makes me feel heavier.

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.281 align:middle line:84%
The other one is how does
it get any better than this.

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.717 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And the other one
is what else is possible.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:27.054 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four statements
that I run through my head

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:31.091 align:middle line:84%
when I am learning about
Access Consciousness.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.828 align:middle line:84%
And those four statements I just
-- but a lot of different things

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.697 align:middle line:84%
up against in order
to get some answers

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:38.732 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have
any reference point.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle line:84%
Those four statements,
those four things

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.238 align:middle line:84%
that you just mentioned,
if you took just those four

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.939 align:middle line:90%
and started instituting them,

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.908 align:middle line:84%
your whole life would
start to change.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.677 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that's -- I mean13
years ago, as you know,

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:52.379 align:middle line:84%
I was at the place where
I was going to kill myself

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.714 align:middle line:90%
if things didn't change.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:55.582 align:middle line:84%
I was literally so
tired of struggling.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.185 align:middle line:84%
And I'd done every self-help
modality I could find,

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.888 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, metaphysics,
everything I could get my hands

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.757 align:middle line:84%
on because I knew something
different should be possible.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:04.791 align:middle line:90%
None of those worked for you?

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.993 align:middle line:84%
None of those resonated
with you?

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.929 align:middle line:84%
Well, they resonated
to some extent.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.732 align:middle line:84%
They worked for a little
while, but after --

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'd go to
a weekend workshop

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.002 align:middle line:84%
and by Wednesday morning
again, I felt like I was buried

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
by the world, because
unfortunately,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.307 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have the practical,
pragmatic tools that I required.

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.175 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it is for
other people, but for me,

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.811 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have the practical,
pragmatic tools I require

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:90%
for when I'm in this place of,

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.449 align:middle line:84%
"I feel so frustrated I just
want to explode and I want

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.717 align:middle line:84%
to kill people, and I
don't know what to do."

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:31.351 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:32.486 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Even -- in a lot of the
stuff that I was doing,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't even
acceptable to feel that way.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:84%
It was, "Oh you're bad if
you don't feel spiritual

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.927 align:middle line:90%
and holy, and enlightened."

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:42.429 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I was like, "Wow, I
must be really bad even here

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:43.997 align:middle line:84%
where I'm not supposed
to be judged.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.198 align:middle line:90%
Apparently I'm really bad

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.501 align:middle line:84%
because I have these
things going on in my head."

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:52.406 align:middle line:84%
And so what Access is, is really
practical, really pragmatic,

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.242 align:middle line:84%
but also it's about going
beyond the judgment of you.

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:58.445 align:middle line:84%
What if what you're experiencing
isn't a judgeable offense?

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:01.348 align:middle line:84%
What if it's what's true
for you in the moment?

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:02.583 align:middle line:90%
What if it's just your --

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:04.318 align:middle line:84%
you know, what if it's
true for you in the moment.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.887 align:middle line:84%
But then what if you have
these ways of changing it?

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:08.789 align:middle line:84%
Like, "Wow," what if it's
true for you in the moment,

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:12.192 align:middle line:84%
but what if it's true that
you're aware of something?

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:14.261 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, if you're
driving down the road,

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.496 align:middle line:84%
you're having a great day,
one of those wonderful days

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.965 align:middle line:84%
where you wake up and you're
driving, and you're on your way

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.667 align:middle line:84%
to work, and all of a sudden
it feels like you get smacked

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
with fear or heaviness.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.906 align:middle line:84%
Or things go wrong, not
the way that you thought.

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.741 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, right, or they start
going wrong like that.

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:29.843 align:middle line:84%
You want to ask immediately,
"Who does this belong to?"

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.578 align:middle line:84%
If it lightens up at
all, it's not yours.

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:90%
What if you don't know?

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.548 align:middle line:90%
Just end it.

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:35.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because...

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.282 align:middle line:90%
Just end it.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.184 align:middle line:84%
...the only thing that's
important is acknowledging

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.318 align:middle line:90%
that it's not yours.

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.888 align:middle line:84%
Oh. And then allowing it
to go back because a lot

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:45.058 align:middle line:84%
of us spend most of our
lives working on stuff

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:47.894 align:middle line:84%
that isn't even ours and then
it goes away for a little while,

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.862 align:middle line:90%
but then it comes back.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I think the difference
with Access

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.634 align:middle line:84%
for me was it was the practical,
pragmatic tools I needed

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.736 align:middle line:90%
to make this reality work.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:58.505 align:middle line:84%
And the tools though aren't
from inside this reality,

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.874 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
looking out here

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.643 align:middle line:84%
from a totally different
reality and awareness

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.945 align:middle line:84%
of what could be possible so
that you can actually bring

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:84%
that reality, you know, should
be possible here and live it.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.584 align:middle line:84%
So how does all this
relate to money?

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:13.153 align:middle line:84%
Right? What is money
anyway, right [laughter]?

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:14.521 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly, what is money?

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.525 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's put it this way,
money is a byproduct, basically.

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.994 align:middle line:84%
So when you perform a service,
when you give somebody a gift

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:23.363 align:middle line:84%
of let's say changing
their lives as an example,

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.166 align:middle line:84%
well a lot of people they'll do
that, but then they don't want

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.768 align:middle line:90%
to ask for the money for it.

00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:31.238 align:middle line:84%
What if you realize that the
real gift for you is the gift

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:84%
of what you're offering
somebody?

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The capacity to change
their life,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.676 align:middle line:84%
if let's say you're
a practitioner

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you make somebody
feel better, you do a massage

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
or something, or you
sell them a widget

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.016 align:middle line:84%
that makes their life better,
that's really the gift.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.218 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be willing
to receive the byproduct,

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:48.155 align:middle line:84%
which is money and a
lot of people aren't.

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:49.656 align:middle line:84%
One of the most interesting
things --

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.492 align:middle line:84%
Gary Douglas, the founder
of Access, when I first came

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:53.827 align:middle line:84%
to Access, one of
the things I wanted

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.063 align:middle line:84%
to change the most was money
and he said to me, he said,

00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.764 align:middle line:84%
"There's no such thing
as a money issue."

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:58.999 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, "What do you mean?"

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.167 align:middle line:90%
He said, "There's only an issue

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.002 align:middle line:84%
in what you're willing
to receive."

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:03.737 align:middle line:84%
If you were truly
willing to receive,

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.405 align:middle line:90%
money wouldn't be an issue.

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.774 align:middle line:84%
But then a lot of other things
wouldn't be an issue either."

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.777 align:middle line:84%
So it's this lack of receiving
that we've developed based

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.979 align:middle line:84%
on our judgments and based
on the points of view

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.614 align:middle line:84%
that we bought, that
really stop us

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:90%
from having the money we like.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.752 align:middle line:84%
There's a class that you
gave in Dublin, Ireland.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:20.887 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And we have some
clips from this --

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
from the class, it
was videotaped.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.826 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful
piece here about receiving.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:29.362 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look at; I want
you guys to take a look at this.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.865 align:middle line:90%
[Video] So much to cover today,

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's not just what
we're going to cover

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.935 align:middle line:84%
and what we're going to
talk about that is going

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.636 align:middle line:90%
to mentally change for you.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.406 align:middle line:84%
Most of what you're going to
get as far as change today,

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:42.209 align:middle line:84%
most of it will not
even be mental.

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:44.745 align:middle line:84%
What? Most of it won't
even be cognitive.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Most of it will be a shift in
your energy that allows you

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:84%
to actually start receiving
because as my best friend,

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.251 align:middle line:84%
Gary Douglas, told
me a long time ago,

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
"There's no such thing
as a money problem.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.622 align:middle line:84%
There's only a problem in what
you're willing to receive,"

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:58.859 align:middle line:84%
and I went, "What are
you talking about?

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.962 align:middle line:84%
He's like, "Well, if you were
willing to receive everything,

00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:03.497 align:middle line:90%
you'd actually allow yourself

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:06.967 align:middle line:84%
to create the money
in order to have it."

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.969 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
at the time,

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:84%
but over the last 13 years
I saw it play out in my life

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.175 align:middle line:84%
and in a lot of other
people's lives.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.144 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that when
they were willing to get

00:11:17.144 --> 00:11:20.013 align:middle line:84%
over what they weren't
willing to receive,

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.582 align:middle line:84%
what they decided they couldn't
receive, shouldn't receive,

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:26.052 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to receive, weren't
valuable enough to receive,

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:29.423 align:middle line:84%
their money situation
started changing dynamically.

00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.624 align:middle line:90%
And I started looking at that.

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "How much work
have you done specifically

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.894 align:middle line:84%
on the area of money for
a lot of these people?"

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.028 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were like,
"Well, you know what,

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.331 align:middle line:84%
I started initially
working on money stuff,

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.101 align:middle line:84%
but then I just started
actually heading for the things

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:44.204 align:middle line:84%
that made me happier
and made my life happy,

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:48.275 align:middle line:84%
and then my money
situation started changing."

00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:50.377 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, interesting.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.814 align:middle line:90%
So what if -- what about this?

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.249 align:middle line:84%
What if having all the
money you'd actually

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:59.286 align:middle line:84%
like to have will
not occur in the way

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.321 align:middle line:90%
that you thought it would?

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:84%
What if it's something totally
different that's necessary?

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.826 align:middle line:84%
From my point of
view, it must be

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.127 align:middle line:84%
because you've tried
all the stuff

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:09.863 align:middle line:84%
that you thought it would
take, you know what I mean?

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.699 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's
still more to do.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.402 align:middle line:84%
What if it's actually
-- what if it's

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.671 align:middle line:84%
about changing your
willingness to receive,

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:20.373 align:middle line:84%
but also your willingness
to be more of you

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle line:90%
in every situation in your life?

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.244 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're doing,
" Being You with Money ,"

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:28.181 align:middle line:84%
is because when you allow
yourself to be more of you,

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:32.219 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of like you know
those mornings when you wake up

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:35.956 align:middle line:84%
and you're just on cloud nine
and nothing can get in your way,

00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:39.025 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like you've got
every possibility available

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:41.194 align:middle line:84%
and then that's like
at 8 o'clock and then

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:43.663 align:middle line:84%
by 10:00 it's gone,
you know what I mean

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:45.065 align:middle line:90%
[audience chuckles]?

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.134 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well what if that could
extend over more of your time,

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:50.737 align:middle line:84%
but do you notice when
you wake up in that state,

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:52.005 align:middle line:90%
that state of possibility,

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to
receive anything.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:84%
When it feels like
-- when it feels

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.277 align:middle line:84%
like everything is just going
great and somebody cuts you off

00:12:57.277 --> 00:13:00.814 align:middle line:84%
in traffic, you're like,
"Yeah, who cares," you know.

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:03.516 align:middle line:84%
When your stepmother calls,
it's like, "Yeah, no big deal,"

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:06.319 align:middle line:84%
or your mother, or your
grandmother, or whoever it is

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:08.588 align:middle line:84%
that usually triggers you,
and you're like, "Wow,

00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:09.689 align:middle line:84%
I just had a conversation
with them

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:90%
that didn't faze me at all."

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.992 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:14.928 align:middle line:84%
Because you were willing to
receive what they were being

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:17.664 align:middle line:84%
without a point of view,
you're willing to receive

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.766 align:middle line:84%
who they were being
without a point of view.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.768 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to receive it
all without a point of view

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of times
we look at receiving,

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.905 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea what
the heck it is.

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:25.705 align:middle line:90%
We're like, "What's receive?

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.575 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, receive money,
blah, blah."

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:31.745 align:middle line:84%
But what receiving is, is being
willing to receive what's there

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:35.448 align:middle line:84%
or what's being presented
without a point of view.

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.584 align:middle line:84%
[End of video] So let's
talk about receiving.

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:39.252 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So you were
just talking about it

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:41.154 align:middle line:90%
in exchange for services.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:45.759 align:middle line:90%
Right. How do you ask for money?

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:47.327 align:middle line:90%
How do you ask for money?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.395 align:middle line:90%
Practice. Practice [chuckles].

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.196 align:middle line:84%
See, and a lot of
this stuff is practice

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:54.301 align:middle line:84%
and what the clearing statement
does, what all the tools do,

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
is they actually make it
easier to be able to say,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.205 align:middle line:90%
for example, ask for money.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.107 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a couple of things.

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:03.977 align:middle line:84%
One is we can do this
stuff to clear things,

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.514 align:middle line:84%
but then you've still
got to choose

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.549 align:middle line:84%
and that's the missing
element in most people's lives,

00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.418 align:middle line:84%
is they don't realize
they have a choice.

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:12.719 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that earlier.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.555 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't believe
that it's their choice.

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:17.223 align:middle line:84%
So how do you learn
to ask for money?

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You go, "Show me the
money now, please.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.695 align:middle line:84%
Can I have the money
now, please?"

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.698 align:middle line:84%
And literally, in class I'll
say, "Okay everybody repeat

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.766 align:middle line:84%
after me," because I
know you have no...

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.902 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...you know, don't
have any better ability to ask

00:14:28.902 --> 00:14:30.203 align:middle line:84%
for money than I did
when I came to Access.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.705 align:middle line:90%
What about a raise?

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You go -- well, what you want
to do is you want to practice

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.309 align:middle line:84%
with yourself and with your
friends, and you go, "Okay,"

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.812 align:middle line:84%
and you say ten times, "Can
I have the money now, please.

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:40.347 align:middle line:84%
Can I have the money
now, please?

00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:41.915 align:middle line:84%
Can I have the money
now, please?

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:43.316 align:middle line:84%
Can I have the money
now, please?

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:44.484 align:middle line:84%
Can I have the money
now, please?"

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:45.952 align:middle line:84%
That's only five,
but you get the idea.

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:47.821 align:middle line:84%
Uh-huh. And then what you
want to do is you want to go,

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:50.557 align:middle line:84%
"Okay so everything that doesn't
allow me to ask for money,

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.293 align:middle line:84%
everywhere I bought that money
was the root of all evil,

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:55.829 align:middle line:84%
everywhere I bought that money
was a bad thing, and everywhere

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:59.032 align:middle line:84%
where I bought it from somebody
who just wanted to get my money

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:01.034 align:middle line:84%
so I would give it away
so I would feel bad

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:03.269 align:middle line:84%
about having it myself,
I now let it go,

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:04.804 align:middle line:90%
destroy and uncreate it."

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.373 align:middle line:84%
Then use the clearing
statement to undo it.

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:07.707 align:middle line:84%
Clearing statement, okay,
because we're going to go

00:15:07.707 --> 00:15:09.876 align:middle line:84%
through the clearing
statement in a second.

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.811 align:middle line:90%
I -- in asking for a raise,

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:16.282 align:middle line:84%
so say your company
hasn't received a raise.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:17.484 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine's a teacher,.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:19.886 align:middle line:84%
Right. She hasn't gotten
a raise for eight years.

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:22.589 align:middle line:84%
Wow. Yeah, and it's
because of furloughs...

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.291 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...and because of the
economy, and specifically,

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.093 align:middle line:90%
the public school system.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.362 align:middle line:90%
Yes. And so it's --

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:34.134 align:middle line:84%
it's infuriating because
her job level is even more

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.036 align:middle line:84%
and increased now because
she's doing the work

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:90%
of two, three people.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.204 align:middle line:90%
Right. She asks for a raise

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:40.407 align:middle line:84%
and she's being told
no again and again.

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.275 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell her?

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I'd say
is, "Okay we need

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.078 align:middle line:84%
to do a little more
in depth work."

00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:46.546 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to give
her one sentence

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:47.647 align:middle line:90%
that would change it all...

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:48.782 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...but that's
not really practical.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.617 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. See, what you
have to realize --

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:53.186 align:middle line:84%
and that is one of the biggest
sadnesses to me, can I say.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:56.389 align:middle line:84%
We pay the people who are
creating our future the least.

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:57.457 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles] Yeah.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.459 align:middle line:84%
We'll pay somebody
who's scraping the land

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.896 align:middle line:84%
and poisoning the water millions
and millions of dollars.

00:16:02.896 --> 00:16:03.997 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, I know.

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:04.998 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have things
a little screwed up.

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.399 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.068 align:middle line:84%
But we all realize that we have
things a little screwed up here,

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:10.937 align:middle line:84%
but rather than going
into resentment of that...

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.138 align:middle line:84%
Okay. ...you have
to look and go,

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.741 align:middle line:84%
"Okay what choices
do I have available?

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what's it going to take
to change the situation?"

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:84%
So what I would start with your
friend, I would say, "Okay,

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.682 align:middle line:84%
so tell me what's
actually going on.

00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:24.751 align:middle line:84%
And tell me what it
is you'd actually

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:25.752 align:middle line:90%
like to get out of this."

00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:26.986 align:middle line:84%
And if she says,
"Well, you know what?

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.122 align:middle line:84%
I need a 20% raise to
even live or survive."

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, "Okay, cool.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.592 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't get that
raise, are you going

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.961 align:middle line:84%
to continue being a teacher
or is it time to look

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.096 align:middle line:90%
for another line of work?"

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:38.998 align:middle line:84%
Right. Okay, and you've
got to be real practical

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.433 align:middle line:90%
about these things while

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:43.169 align:middle line:84%
at the same time changing
the energy behind it.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.772 align:middle line:84%
She's really great at -- she
and her husband have a hobby

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.108 align:middle line:90%
of building homes [laughter].

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.876 align:middle line:90%
As you do.

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:53.279 align:middle line:84%
They had a home in
Katrina that got blown away

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.014 align:middle line:84%
and they rebuilt it
over a summer with...

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.082 align:middle line:90%
Wow. ...themselves.

00:16:56.082 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're a very,
very handy couple.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Right. And so she
could even pick that up

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.255 align:middle line:84%
as a side job during
the summers...

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.223 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...and make
an extra income.

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:04.557 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:05.759 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of her
looking in a different direction

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.659 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of the
judgment that she has

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
around the school
system, the system.

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.898 align:middle line:84%
Yes, around the school system
and also around the idea

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.634 align:middle line:84%
that that's the only
contribution she can be

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:15.635 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:17.669 align:middle line:84%
I mean so many of
our teachers do it

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.405 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to change the world.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.473 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:21.808 align:middle line:84%
You know, they want
to be a contribution

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:23.576 align:middle line:90%
that changes our future,

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.412 align:middle line:84%
but what if what
she's being told is.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.746 align:middle line:90%
"Hey, you know what?

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.083 align:middle line:84%
This is one way but there
are all kinds of other ways."

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.719 align:middle line:84%
What if what she could do,
if she could take that skill

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.587 align:middle line:84%
that she has for home
building or whatever...

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...actually start making
more money and then go around

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.225 align:middle line:84%
and teach teachers how
to make more money.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle line:84%
What if that would
change the world even more

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
than her being in her classroom?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.298 align:middle line:84%
But if she has the fixed
point of view that she's got

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:46.432 align:middle line:90%
to stay there in her classroom

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:47.834 align:middle line:84%
because that's her
contribution...

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:50.837 align:middle line:84%
Uh-huh. ...she misses the other
opportunities the universe has

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:51.771 align:middle line:90%
for her.

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
judgment kills us.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Decision, judgment,
and conclusion kill us

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.112 align:middle line:84%
because nothing that
doesn't match our decision,

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:01.247 align:middle line:84%
our judgment, or our
conclusion can even come

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.549 align:middle line:90%
into our awareness.

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do with
her at first, is I'd say,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.952 align:middle line:84%
"Everything you have
as your point of view

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:08.988 align:middle line:84%
about being a teacher and why
you did it, all the judgments

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:84%
and the conclusions about
that, will you destroy

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.125 align:middle line:90%
and uncreate it, please.

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.827 align:middle line:90%
And will you let it go?

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.295 align:middle line:84%
And all of -- everywhere
you bought

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:17.063 align:middle line:84%
that that was the only
way you could contribute,

00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:18.498 align:middle line:90%
will you let that go?

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:21.201 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about some other
contributions you might be able

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:24.304 align:middle line:84%
to be that would change the
world in an even larger way."

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:26.673 align:middle line:90%
And notice the energy with that.

00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:27.974 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. It tingles your body.

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:28.975 align:middle line:90%
It tingles my body.

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:30.143 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully people
listening or watching.

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:31.477 align:middle line:84%
Laura, I hope you're
watching, yeah [laughter].

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:32.745 align:middle line:84%
Laura, we hope you're watching,
we hope you're getting it.

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.113 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking around like
they're here, you know.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:34.814 align:middle line:90%
Hi. Yeah [laughter].

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.216 align:middle line:90%
Hi everybody [laughter].

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:40.153 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. It's that, it's that,
it's getting that into people.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a reference
for something like this.

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly and that's
the thing about Access

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.559 align:middle line:84%
that I've noticed, is people
don't have a reference point

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.929 align:middle line:84%
for getting to that level
of space that quickly

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:51.664 align:middle line:90%
and also for living that.

00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:52.799 align:middle line:90%
And what I'm trying

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:84%
to let people know is
look, you can live it.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was literally
going to kill myself

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.004 align:middle line:90%
if things didn't change.

00:18:58.004 --> 00:18:59.339 align:middle line:90%
That was not a joke.

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:84%
It's not a -- anything other
than where I was in my life

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:03.476 align:middle line:84%
at the time because
of the struggle.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean this sense of space that
we just talked about with her,

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:84%
that's where I live and
the thousands of people

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:11.517 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked
with start living.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:16.589 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of someone
who maybe is predisposed

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:22.528 align:middle line:84%
to depression or has
habitual depression, anxiety,

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.596 align:middle line:90%
those types of things.

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:24.964 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let me tell you.

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:29.402 align:middle line:84%
That is somebody who is so
aware that they are so aware

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:31.404 align:middle line:84%
of the thoughts, feelings, and
emotions and the depression

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:32.872 align:middle line:84%
and the unhappiness
around people.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:37.076 align:middle line:84%
Hmm. And usually, most of the
time, they're actually a healer,

00:19:37.076 --> 00:19:38.978 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's trying to
pull these energies in to try

00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:41.614 align:middle line:84%
to change them so they can
change them in the world.

00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:90%
Notice the title of the book is,

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:44.951 align:middle line:84%
" Being You, Changing
the World ."

00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:48.187 align:middle line:84%
So many people out
there are actually --

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.723 align:middle line:84%
they actually have a desire,
a willingness, and a capacity

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:52.892 align:middle line:84%
to change the world and
they're actually doing it

00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:56.095 align:middle line:84%
in the best way they can, but
nobody's ever told them, "Hey,

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:58.464 align:middle line:84%
taking it into your
world doesn't help.

00:19:58.464 --> 00:20:01.234 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is let
it go out of your world

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
so you can become undepressed
and then become an inspiration

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.506 align:middle line:84%
to other people that being
undepressed is okay."

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.441 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about the phrase

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.209 align:middle line:90%
of the depression is your gift?

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.778 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is your gift?

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:15.982 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would look at it --
that's one way of looking at it.

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:17.383 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going to have a
different perspective [chuckle],

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:18.518 align:middle line:90%
that's why...

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:19.285 align:middle line:84%
Well, I usually have a
different perspective

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:20.253 align:middle line:90%
on pretty much everything.

00:20:20.253 --> 00:20:21.988 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much -- which
is what I love.

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:23.156 align:middle line:90%
I can just fire stuff at you

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:24.991 align:middle line:84%
and you can give me
your perspective on it.

00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:25.658 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, well...

00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:26.392 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Cancer was my gift.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.761 align:middle line:90%
Depression was my gift.

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:31.164 align:middle line:84%
Well, well, it can be
because it's like --

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:34.867 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look at it
as the gift then you look

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.203 align:middle line:84%
for what is this letting
me know that can be better

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:39.472 align:middle line:84%
or different, or
that I can change?

00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:41.841 align:middle line:84%
That's the gift that these
things are, is what I would say.

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:43.376 align:middle line:90%
Like for example, the fact

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:45.445 align:middle line:84%
that your friend hasn't
been given a raise

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.613 align:middle line:84%
in eight years even though
she's doing the work of two

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:48.448 align:middle line:90%
and three people now...

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:49.716 align:middle line:90%
I doubt she'll call that a gift.

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she'll call
that a gift [chuckles].

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.954 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, but what if she could
look and go, "Wow, what's right

00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:56.622 align:middle line:90%
about this, I'm not getting."

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.592 align:middle line:84%
That would be my spin
on the gift idea.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.027 align:middle line:84%
What's right about
this I'm not getting?

00:21:01.027 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
you look at that,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.264 align:middle line:84%
what it could be is
the universe going,

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.033 align:middle line:84%
"Hey there are other
possibilities available."

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.301 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one possibility.

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
There may be a thousand other
things that it could be.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.439 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says cancer's
a gift or this is a gift,

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.308 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times they have
a fixed point of view.

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:17.944 align:middle line:84%
They have a fixed point of
view about what it means.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.679 align:middle line:84%
For me, rather than having
a fixed point of view,

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather be in the question.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather be like, "Wow,
what is the gift here?"

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.418 align:middle line:84%
and ask this question,
"What's right

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:27.153 align:middle line:90%
about this I'm not getting?"

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:28.988 align:middle line:84%
What's right about
this I'm not getting?

00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:31.357 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because what we
do is we tend to judge

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:32.992 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
wrong about all these things

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:33.926 align:middle line:90%
that occur in our lives.

00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:35.395 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
ask what's right

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
about this I'm not getting,
you can see the gift in it.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:42.068 align:middle line:84%
Wow you have said -- when I said
it myself, it lit up for me.

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:43.236 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:44.437 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.938 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So there are clearing
statements that you --

00:21:45.938 --> 00:21:48.174 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
in just a second here.

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:50.042 align:middle line:84%
Yes. We're going to take
a look at the video again,

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:52.445 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to see some
of these clearing statements

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.247 align:middle line:84%
from Access Consciousness
in action.

00:21:54.247 --> 00:21:55.815 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:59.585 align:middle line:84%
Can you change the
world more with no money

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:00.887 align:middle line:90%
or with lots of money?

00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:02.088 align:middle line:90%
Lots of money.

00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:03.489 align:middle line:90%
Lots. Why?

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.291 align:middle line:84%
Because you can contribute
things to people

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.593 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
otherwise be able to do.

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.463 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go do something
like take an Access class

00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
as an example, you can go
do it or any other class,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.934 align:middle line:84%
or any other traveling
you want to do,

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:16.702 align:middle line:84%
or any other contribution
you want to do.

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:19.338 align:middle line:84%
When somebody comes and says,
"I've got this great idea?

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:84%
I really want to run
bars in an orphanage

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%
and I just need the money."

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.713 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
"I have $5 bucks."

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.115 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between that and, "Hey,

00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:30.349 align:middle line:84%
I've got $500 grand
I can give you."

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:33.719 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean,
big difference.

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:37.356 align:middle line:84%
And so even when I say $500
grand everything that brings

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.692 align:middle line:84%
up [audience laughter] where
you just go and create a place,

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:41.327 align:middle line:84%
ride along, good and bad,
POC and POD, all nine,

00:22:41.327 --> 00:22:42.562 align:middle line:90%
shorts boys and beyond.

00:22:42.562 --> 00:22:48.468 align:middle line:84%
So the -- one of the things
you want to realize is

00:22:48.468 --> 00:22:51.904 align:middle line:84%
that money is one
of the biggest --

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:54.307 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the biggest
judgable offenses on the planet

00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:56.509 align:middle line:84%
like having it, but the
people who are willing

00:22:56.509 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:90%
to have it don't care

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.313 align:middle line:84%
about other people's
judgments that they have it.

00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:02.548 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:05.017 align:middle line:84%
[Background talking] So
what is it you are unwilling

00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:08.821 align:middle line:84%
to be judged for, that if you
were willing to simply receive

00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:11.424 align:middle line:84%
that judgment [door banging]
and receive it means, "Oh,

00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
interesting judgment you
have of me, go on through."

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.963 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Not, "Let me stick
it here and make it real.

00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:18.965 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I can't believe
you have this judgment of me,

00:23:18.965 --> 00:23:21.267 align:middle line:84%
what can I do so you don't
have this judgment of me,

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:22.301 align:middle line:90%
so you can stop judging me,

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.302 align:middle line:84%
because I know you're
judging me,

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:25.071 align:middle line:84%
and it's so bad that
you judge me."

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:26.439 align:middle line:90%
That's not receiving it.

00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:29.375 align:middle line:84%
That's aligning and agreeing
with it, and making it real.

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Receiving it is, "Wow,

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.179 align:middle line:84%
interesting judgment I
see that you have of me.

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:34.147 align:middle line:90%
Go on through.

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:35.648 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your judgment."

00:23:35.648 --> 00:23:37.683 align:middle line:84%
Get this, for every
judgment you're willing

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:40.386 align:middle line:84%
to receive you make
$5,000 more that year

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:44.657 align:middle line:84%
or $5,000 pounds depending
on your local currency.

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:46.325 align:middle line:90%
Euros. $5,000 Euros, thank you.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
[Audience laughter]
I was just --

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing a class
in London for four days.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.599 align:middle line:84%
It was like -- I have no idea
where the hell I am anymore.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:56.769 align:middle line:84%
[Audience laughter] Okay,
nor the currency, may I say.

00:23:56.769 --> 00:24:00.606 align:middle line:84%
So $5,000 Euros more for
every judgment you're willing

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:01.974 align:middle line:90%
to receive.

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:07.213 align:middle line:84%
For every judgment you try
to refuse, you lose $10,000.

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:10.483 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you know why your
income looks the way it does.

00:24:10.483 --> 00:24:11.617 align:middle line:84%
[Audience laughter]
Everything [inaudible] destroy

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.686 align:middle line:84%
or create a place, right
or wrong, good and bad,

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
POC and POD, all nine,
shorts boys and beyond.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:22.795 align:middle line:84%
Wow. Okay, so what judgment
are you unwilling to receive

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:24.163 align:middle line:90%
that if you allowed yourself

00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:28.734 align:middle line:84%
to receive would change your
financial situation completely?

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:31.804 align:middle line:84%
Is money -- the scarcity
conversation,

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.906 align:middle line:90%
do you find it repetitive?

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:90%
All around the world?

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.675 align:middle line:90%
Around the world.

00:24:35.675 --> 00:24:37.843 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, yes, as in
all around the world.

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:40.913 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I also find
people who are like,

00:24:40.913 --> 00:24:43.249 align:middle line:84%
"What scarcity conversation,
what are you talking about?

00:24:43.249 --> 00:24:45.151 align:middle line:84%
I'm making more money
than I ever have."

00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:46.919 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, "Oh."

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:49.288 align:middle line:84%
Once again, your point of
view creates your reality.

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:50.623 align:middle line:84%
Reality creates your
point of view,

00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:53.259 align:middle line:84%
it's just more people
have been entrained

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:90%
to the scarcity paradigm.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.463 align:middle line:84%
And you know, entrainment is
where you learn to vibrate

00:24:57.463 --> 00:25:00.666 align:middle line:84%
at the same rate as
somebody is vibrating.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:02.435 align:middle line:84%
And so because we've
done that --

00:25:02.435 --> 00:25:05.438 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've talked about the
-- who does this belong to...

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:07.206 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...your thoughts,
feelings, and emotions,

00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:10.243 align:middle line:84%
that's how you learn
to create initially,

00:25:10.243 --> 00:25:12.511 align:middle line:84%
but then ideally what
happens is you go beyond

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.981 align:middle line:84%
that to how would
I like to create?

00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:16.916 align:middle line:90%
What would I like to create?

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle line:84%
And the question I like to ask
people is if you had not past

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:22.288 align:middle line:84%
and if you had no
projection into the future

00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:24.824 align:middle line:84%
about what it could or couldn't
be, and if you didn't have

00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:26.826 align:middle line:84%
to keep anybody in your
life that's currently there,

00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:28.728 align:middle line:90%
what would you choose?

00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:30.029 align:middle line:90%
What would you create?

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.931 align:middle line:90%
And paint that picture?

00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:34.367 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So do -- where do you
start, with the values list,

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:84%
do you start with the
place you would live?

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:36.736 align:middle line:90%
Where would you start?

00:25:36.736 --> 00:25:38.037 align:middle line:90%
No, you start with the energy.

00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Hmm. What energy would
I like my life to have?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.376 align:middle line:90%
Wow. Is peace a good place?

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:47.213 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, peace,
space, joy, abundance,

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:49.281 align:middle line:84%
and the way you can get the
energies of these things,

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of interesting.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:84%
If you ask yourself, "Okay,"
so here's an exercise we can do

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.719 align:middle line:90%
in maybe three minutes.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:54.387 align:middle line:90%
Okay, good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:55.021 align:middle line:90%
Want to do it?

00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:55.721 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay, cool.

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:56.922 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you do.

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.825 align:middle line:84%
Just get the energy of,
for example, having a job

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:03.029 align:middle line:84%
that pays you, let's say double
what you're making right now...

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:06.499 align:middle line:84%
Okay. ...and goes up to I
don't know, $5, $10 million.

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Get the energy
of that and just put

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.969 align:middle line:90%
that energy out in front of you.

00:26:09.969 --> 00:26:12.405 align:middle line:84%
Now, would you also
like to do something

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:15.174 align:middle line:84%
that changes people's
lives that contributes

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to the world, get
those energies?

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.511 align:middle line:90%
Like, "Oh, okay."

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:19.845 align:middle line:84%
Notice how it opens
up even more?

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:20.946 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.248 align:middle line:84%
You're like oh, that
energy would be cool.

00:26:22.248 --> 00:26:24.183 align:middle line:84%
Uh-huh. Notice we're
not defining it.

00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:25.418 align:middle line:84%
We're not defining
what the job is,

00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:27.153 align:middle line:84%
we're defining the energies
we'd like it to have

00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:31.223 align:middle line:84%
and then the universe can put
it in whatever form it can

00:26:31.223 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with you and
what you're willing to receive.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.062 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know what it is
when it shows up that way.

00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:37.263 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay, keep going.

00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:40.266 align:middle line:84%
So now also would you
like to be able to travel?

00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:42.468 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, most
people would, you know.

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, cool, so get
that energy, what'd it'd be

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.938 align:middle line:90%
like to travel with ease.

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you traveled,
would you like to be able

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to stay wherever you wanted
to whether it was, you know,

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.612 align:middle line:84%
a five-star hotel
or an apartment,

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.048 align:middle line:90%
or get the ease of that.

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:56.682 align:middle line:90%
A boat [chuckles].

00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:57.616 align:middle line:90%
Or a boat, yeah...

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:58.951 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...or a yacht,
or whatever.

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.519 align:middle line:90%
Get the way that would feel.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.421 align:middle line:84%
Now, also, would it
change all the time

00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
because you know how
quickly we get bored?

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.625 align:middle line:84%
So get the energy of it
changing all the time

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.261 align:middle line:84%
and actually getting greater
all the time, not lesser,

00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:12.198 align:middle line:84%
and not contracting into on
doing the same thing every day,

00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:14.467 align:middle line:84%
but, "Wow, look what
I get to do today."

00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:16.902 align:middle line:84%
And now get the energy of
being able to contribute

00:27:16.902 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to your family, contribute
to your life, and contribute

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.976 align:middle line:84%
to the world in the way
that you would like to

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:26.812 align:middle line:84%
with your amazingly
unique phenomenal gifts,

00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:29.115 align:middle line:90%
and get that energy there too.

00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:34.186 align:middle line:84%
Now, pull energy into that
energy bubble if you will

00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle line:84%
from all over the universe
and it's a big universe.

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.991 align:middle line:84%
Don't even stop at earth,
like big universe...

00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:41.227 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh. ...bigger, big --

00:27:41.227 --> 00:27:43.729 align:middle line:84%
more like that, and your
heart should open up.

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:45.664 align:middle line:84%
And now, let little
trickles go out to everyone

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and everything who's going to
help make it a reality for you

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.402 align:middle line:90%
that you don't even know yet.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.471 align:middle line:84%
That's how to start
creating a life

00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and living beyond what
you currently have based

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.043 align:middle line:84%
on the energies of all the
things that you would truly like

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:00.546 align:middle line:84%
and that would light you on
fire, and make you wake up

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:03.082 align:middle line:84%
and have such a sense
of possibility.

00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:04.884 align:middle line:90%
Breath space, yes, yes.

00:28:04.884 --> 00:28:06.852 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, Absolutely.

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:08.754 align:middle line:84%
And it takes all
those little problems

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:11.023 align:middle line:84%
and the scarcity
conversation and dwarfs them...

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:11.957 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ...makes them...

00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:13.559 align:middle line:90%
Because they're lies.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:15.494 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Remember, what's true
makes you feel lighter;

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:17.129 align:middle line:84%
a lie always makes
you feel heavier.

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:18.397 align:middle line:90%
All the scarcity conversation --

00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:20.166 align:middle line:84%
have you ever had a
scarcity conversation

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that made you feel
lighter [laughter]?

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.134 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:24.203 align:middle line:84%
No. Yeah. It makes
you feel small.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you don't get into a
room with people and talk

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.574 align:middle line:84%
about scarcity an all of a
sudden go, "Oh, I feel so light,

00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.476 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we had
this conversation."

00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:32.645 align:middle line:84%
When you do though, it's
so heavy and limiting.

00:28:32.645 --> 00:28:35.848 align:middle line:84%
I know -- it's because it's
a lie for us as beings.

00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:37.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes.

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.185 align:middle line:84%
And what we've done is we've
bought into this reality

00:28:39.185 --> 00:28:41.554 align:middle line:84%
and limited points of
view that people have,

00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:44.423 align:middle line:84%
and what they think is real
and has to be reality rather

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:45.491 align:middle line:90%
than going, "You know what?

00:28:45.491 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm standing for
something different.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.795 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing for a
different possibility

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:51.197 align:middle line:90%
and a different planet.

00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:52.398 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not standing --

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
," I don't say stand
meaning I'm going to fight.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "You know
what, I'm just going

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:57.603 align:middle line:84%
to know there's something
different

00:28:57.603 --> 00:28:59.138 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to live as that."

00:28:59.138 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You all can have your
scarcity conversation

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.043 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you enjoy it, and I
see it's not making you happier

00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:05.611 align:middle line:84%
and I'm tired of
not being happier.

00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:09.481 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be happier and
I'm going to be as spacious,

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.151 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, wealthy,
abundant, changing,

00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:14.587 align:middle line:84%
traveling as all these things
I just asked to create.

00:29:14.587 --> 00:29:15.988 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:18.524 align:middle line:84%
And do this thing once a week
maybe, once every few days...

00:29:18.524 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you're assuming you have
perfect health during all

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.361 align:middle line:90%
of this, as well.

00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:24.129 align:middle line:84%
So bring that into
the conversation.

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.364 align:middle line:90%
Yeah? Absolutely.

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like if
you had the energy of that?

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.704 align:middle line:84%
To go out, ride a horse, Jet
Ski, do whatever you want to do.

00:29:31.704 --> 00:29:33.305 align:middle line:84%
Yeah exactly, definitely,
all those things, yes.

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:34.573 align:middle line:90%
Ride a bike.

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:36.242 align:middle line:84%
You have that type of
freedom in your body, as well.

00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:37.977 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. To be able to
create at that level.

00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:40.212 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and what happens is
this is actually creation

00:29:40.212 --> 00:29:41.814 align:middle line:90%
by request of the universe.

00:29:41.814 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:84%
And the universe has been
hoping you would ask,

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:46.785 align:middle line:84%
but so many of the tools
we're given don't connect us

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.355 align:middle line:84%
with the universe to
allow it to give to us.

00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:51.957 align:middle line:84%
Okay, let's talk about
synchronicities, coincidences.

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:53.459 align:middle line:84%
Yes. What do you
think about those?

00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:56.362 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say -- I look
at that and I go, "Wow,

00:29:56.362 --> 00:29:59.064 align:middle line:84%
this is sort of the universe
coming together fortuitously

00:29:59.064 --> 00:29:59.865 align:middle line:90%
to contribute to us."

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:01.433 align:middle line:90%
Do you look for them?

00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:03.969 align:middle line:84%
No, they just happen
all the time,

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.971 align:middle line:84%
but I don't even call them
synchronicities anymore.

00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:11.377 align:middle line:84%
I just call it -- for me,
it's a natural actualization

00:30:11.377 --> 00:30:14.813 align:middle line:84%
of universal laws
in motion basically.

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:15.981 align:middle line:90%
You're like, "What?

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:17.449 align:middle line:90%
Was that English," you know?

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:20.986 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's like the
universe wants to contribute.

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.055 align:middle line:90%
The universe wants to show us.

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:25.524 align:middle line:84%
I think what we do is we go,
"Oh, that's a synchronicity,"

00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:27.993 align:middle line:90%
and in so doing we define it.

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:90%
Rather than going, "Wow,

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that's a miracle I just frigging
created, what would it take

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.332 align:middle line:90%
to have more of that?"

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:35.334 align:middle line:90%
Hmm. So for me they're miracles.

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They're like man, the
beauty of being alive

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.706 align:middle line:84%
because if you look it,
it's like these things

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:43.409 align:middle line:84%
when they happen and they
don't happen when we allow it

00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:46.412 align:middle line:84%
to happen, when we're willing to
receive it, and be there for it.

00:30:46.412 --> 00:30:47.846 align:middle line:84%
It's like they are,
they're the miracle

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.616 align:middle line:84%
that makes life worthwhile --
that makes living possible.

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:52.351 align:middle line:84%
But usually, you take
that miracle and go,

00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
"Oh God I had a miracle,
I'm just going

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.654 align:middle line:90%
to keep this over here.

00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:57.022 align:middle line:90%
I don't want any more miracles?

00:30:57.022 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, put it in a box.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.058 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] I've had
my fill of miracles

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:00.826 align:middle line:90%
for the day -- for the year.

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:02.194 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, "Gees, if I ask

00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:03.629 align:middle line:84%
for another miracle that's
going to be really bad."

00:31:03.629 --> 00:31:05.431 align:middle line:84%
Who am I to ask for
anything more?

00:31:05.431 --> 00:31:07.032 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. Yeah, that's
why that point of view.

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:08.367 align:middle line:90%
That was luck.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.069 align:middle line:84%
My point of view is how does
it get any better than this?

00:31:10.069 --> 00:31:12.438 align:middle line:84%
Once you have a miracle
happen go, "Wow universe,

00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
thank you so much this
is so cool, thank you me,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.941 align:middle line:90%
thank you body, okay."

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than this?

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:84%
See, that's the thing where
I said you want to ask it

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:22.114 align:middle line:84%
in a bad situation
or a good situation.

00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:24.383 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. That's thing, when
you create the miracle ask,

00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:27.553 align:middle line:84%
"How does it get any better than
this," and it keeps growing.

00:31:27.553 --> 00:31:28.821 align:middle line:84%
It actually keeps
getting better.

00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:32.458 align:middle line:84%
It keeps expanding even
further and creating even more.

00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:33.525 align:middle line:90%
Has anyone ever said to you,

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:35.561 align:middle line:84%
"Well that's your
reality, it's not mine??

00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Oh, absolutely and I
look at them and I go,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.966 align:middle line:84%
"Which of us is having more
fun, me or you [laughter]?

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:42.101 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] I say that I used

00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:44.203 align:middle line:84%
to be living a reality
that's a lot like yours.

00:31:44.203 --> 00:31:46.405 align:middle line:84%
"So I totally get if
you're not interested

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:47.806 align:middle line:84%
in what I'm talking
about, I totally get it

00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:50.142 align:middle line:84%
and I'm totally willing for
you to have that," I said.

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:53.379 align:middle line:84%
"But if you are, it's
so easy to get here.

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:55.848 align:middle line:84%
All it requires is a change
in your point of view,"

00:31:55.848 --> 00:31:57.916 align:middle line:84%
and literally, that's
where the access tools are.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.586 align:middle line:84%
I mean I consider it sort
of like the biggest toolbox

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:03.689 align:middle line:84%
on the planet for
possibilities for when you want

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:06.692 align:middle line:84%
to change something you dig in
and go, "Oh, I'll try this one,"

00:32:06.692 --> 00:32:07.893 align:middle line:84%
and it'll change things
and they're like, "Ooh,

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.661 align:middle line:84%
let me try this one,
let me try this one,"

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:12.297 align:middle line:84%
and the more tools you have the
more things you have to throw

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.099 align:middle line:84%
at any situation
that isn't working

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:84%
and the more tools you have
to create ones that you like.

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.872 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like an eight-step
process to prosperity?

00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:21.206 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly.

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:22.041 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:23.442 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles] Tell me.

00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:27.546 align:middle line:84%
Because each person's process,
path to prosperity, is theirs.

00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:31.383 align:middle line:84%
The thing about this is
let's find out what yours is

00:32:31.383 --> 00:32:33.752 align:middle line:84%
because literally in
a -- I literally --

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:38.057 align:middle line:84%
I worked with one
lady for 15 minutes.

00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:43.295 align:middle line:84%
Her business doubled within
12 months -- 15 minutes.

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were going
to say 15 years [laughter].

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.131 align:middle line:84%
Right, exactly --
you're like, "Okay,

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.266 align:middle line:90%
and what happened with her?"

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:49.401 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. No, literally, 15 minutes.

00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.303 align:middle line:84%
She had one point of view
that was sticking things.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:53.439 align:middle line:84%
I mean she basically had the
basic elements of success.

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:55.741 align:middle line:84%
Ahh. She had the elements of
gratitude, she had the elements

00:32:55.741 --> 00:33:00.512 align:middle line:84%
of joy, but she was missing
this thing about she being able

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:01.914 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to reality.

00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
I hear that a lot from my
listeners on my radio show is,

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:05.717 align:middle line:90%
"I'm doing this, this, this."

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.453 align:middle line:84%
Right. "I've got all of
the right ingredients.

00:33:07.453 --> 00:33:09.721 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not achieving XYZ?"

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.256 align:middle line:90%
Yes. I hear that a lot.

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:12.658 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, as do I.

00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:15.461 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting when
you see somebody who has that

00:33:15.461 --> 00:33:18.664 align:middle line:84%
and then you talk to them
for 15 minutes to an hour

00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can tweak that
thing in their world,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.168 align:middle line:84%
and then they have a different
world that they can create.

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:24.703 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you -- when
you're talking to them,

00:33:24.703 --> 00:33:26.672 align:middle line:84%
you realize what
they're limiting belief

00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:28.941 align:middle line:84%
or what their reality is,
what their judgments are

00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:30.642 align:middle line:84%
and then you start to
unlock and loosen those,

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:31.877 align:middle line:90%
is that what Access does?

00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.946 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, start to unlock
and loosen those and --

00:33:33.946 --> 00:33:35.747 align:middle line:84%
because why should you
walk around in judgment?

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.182 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you've got a
choice between walking

00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:40.419 align:middle line:84%
around in judgment or walking
in gratitude and joy...

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it makes you feel lighter.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.288 align:middle line:84%
...why are we choosing
judgment, again.

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:47.025 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude and judgment
are mutually exclusive.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.861 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude and joy are
mutually exclusive.

00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:50.596 align:middle line:84%
So you can have gratitude
and joy,

00:33:50.596 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:90%
which means you're not judging

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.601 align:middle line:84%
because any time you judge
you're not in gratitude and joy.

00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Right. But it's also got
to be really practical.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.938 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be really
practical...

00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:02.007 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...because it's not,
"Oh I'm out of gratitude,

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bad person," which is what
I used to get before Access.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.678 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, I'm not in gratitude,
I'm a bad person,

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:08.213 align:middle line:90%
but I want to be grateful.

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:09.581 align:middle line:90%
The world won't let me."

00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:11.682 align:middle line:84%
Right. These are the tools for
when you want to be grateful

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:13.452 align:middle line:84%
and the world won't let
you, you want to be joyful.

00:34:13.452 --> 00:34:14.385 align:middle line:90%
You would like to be happy.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.287 align:middle line:84%
You'd like to be
rich or whatever.

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:18.423 align:middle line:84%
What if none of it is wrong
and none of it is judge-able?

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:20.626 align:middle line:84%
What if it's all changeable
and what if it's all choice?

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:22.728 align:middle line:84%
Hmm, all right, take
a look at this.

00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:24.329 align:middle line:84%
There's some really, really
great teaching moments

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:25.697 align:middle line:84%
in this class that
you did in Dublin.

00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:26.965 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:31.603 align:middle line:84%
[Video] You could walk around
lowering your barriers.

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:33.405 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So every morning
what I'm going to ask you

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:38.644 align:middle line:84%
to do is lower your barriers
before you even get out of bed.

00:34:38.644 --> 00:34:43.282 align:middle line:84%
Just lower the barriers because
what happens is a lot of us,

00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:45.584 align:middle line:84%
you know, we'll go to bed
and we're okay and we wake up

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:49.921 align:middle line:84%
and we're like, "Oh, God it
sucks, why am I so unhappy?"

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.691 align:middle line:84%
You're not, you're picking
up on the unhappiness

00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:54.026 align:middle line:90%
of the world around you.

00:34:54.026 --> 00:34:55.727 align:middle line:90%
98% of your thoughts, feelings,

00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:57.396 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, don't
belong to you.

00:34:57.396 --> 00:34:59.131 align:middle line:84%
If this is your first
time hearing this,

00:34:59.131 --> 00:35:00.833 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to highly
suggest you do

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:03.602 align:middle line:84%
who does this belong
to for three days.

00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:06.071 align:middle line:84%
Okay? You'll get an
email after this class

00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:08.507 align:middle line:84%
with my little video explaining
who does this belong to,

00:35:08.507 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
but you want to ask who does
this belong to for three days

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.612 align:middle line:84%
to every thought,
feeling, emotion --

00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:15.714 align:middle line:84%
basically everything that
makes you feel heavy at all.

00:35:15.714 --> 00:35:18.684 align:middle line:84%
Any little drop of heaviness
that's not the space,

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:20.452 align:middle line:90%
just go who does that belong to.

00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:84%
And if it lightens up
at all it's not yours,

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.189 align:middle line:90%
return it to sender.

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:26.558 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And you'll do it for a
couple of hours, you'll forget

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:29.127 align:middle line:84%
for an hour, you'll do it for
an hour, forget for an hour,

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.196 align:middle line:84%
you'll do it for two hours,
you'll forget for two hours,

00:35:31.196 --> 00:35:33.198 align:middle line:84%
you'll do it for 20 minutes,
you'll forget for 30 minutes,

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:34.766 align:middle line:84%
you'll do it for an hour
and then you'll fall asleep

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:37.069 align:middle line:84%
in bed exhausted
after that first day,

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:39.404 align:middle line:84%
because it's the toughest
work you've ever had to do.

00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:41.907 align:middle line:84%
You'll do it again like that the
second day and the third day,

00:35:41.907 --> 00:35:43.809 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of the third
day there's this amazing thing

00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:47.479 align:middle line:84%
that happens - no
thoughts in your head.

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:48.714 align:middle line:90%
No points of view in your head

00:35:48.714 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:84%
and you realize you've
broken the mechanism

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:54.253 align:middle line:84%
that made you believe that all
those thoughts, those feelings,

00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.622 align:middle line:84%
those emotions, those
ideas of poverty,

00:35:56.622 --> 00:36:00.058 align:middle line:84%
those ideas you can't do it,
those ideas that you're less,

00:36:00.058 --> 00:36:01.894 align:middle line:84%
those ideas that you
need to be separate,

00:36:01.894 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
those ideas that you're
unhappy, none of them are yours.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.402 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Literally, 98% it's
actually more like 98,000%

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:13.205 align:middle line:84%
of your thoughts, feelings, and
emotions don't belong to you.

00:36:13.205 --> 00:36:16.108 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you
if you haven't done this,

00:36:16.108 --> 00:36:19.411 align:middle line:84%
please start -- you can start
now if you want to or start

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
when you go home tonight, or
start next time you listen

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.448 align:middle line:84%
to the audio because
you won't remember it

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
until then, no problem.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.486 align:middle line:84%
Okay? But you want to do
who does this belong to

00:36:27.486 --> 00:36:29.788 align:middle line:90%
and put sticky notes everywhere.

00:36:29.788 --> 00:36:32.424 align:middle line:84%
Who does this belong to
or WDTBT, which is short,

00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:37.729 align:middle line:90%
who does this belong to.

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:41.466 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And literally, you'll
start realizing that all

00:36:41.466 --> 00:36:44.069 align:middle line:84%
that crappy thought you had
about money was stuff you picked

00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:47.339 align:middle line:84%
up from other people your whole
life and thought was yours.

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:53.011 align:middle line:84%
So, what have you decided
money is that it isn't

00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:57.783 align:middle line:84%
that if you didn't have
that as your point of view,

00:36:57.783 --> 00:36:59.952 align:middle line:84%
would allow you to create
more money than God?

00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:04.323 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is right or
wrong, good and bad, POC POD,

00:37:04.323 --> 00:37:06.091 align:middle line:84%
all nine, shorts
boys, and beyonds.

00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:09.728 align:middle line:84%
So that clearing statement
that you have mentioned...

00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:13.231 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I learned that -- you
told me this, that there's

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.801 align:middle line:84%
like about eight pages
worth of definition

00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:17.069 align:middle line:90%
of that clearing statement.

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:20.205 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and so that one
statement that sounds so weird

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:23.241 align:middle line:84%
to people is literally short
for eight pages of material.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.743 align:middle line:84%
And rather than having to
read through eight pages

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:26.978 align:middle line:84%
of material every time you want
to change something, we're like,

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
"Okay we can short cut
it to this and this,

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.015 align:middle line:90%
and this, and this, and this."

00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:31.383 align:middle line:84%
What you can do if you want
to go to the website...

00:37:31.383 --> 00:37:32.751 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ..."Let Access Be You."

00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. That's all on
there, but if you want

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.688 align:middle line:90%
to just condense it -- so what

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that clearing statement
does is it packs the energy

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
from the massive clearing
that you put together.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.431 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did you create that?

00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:50.068 align:middle line:84%
It actually came together
over many, many years.

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.937 align:middle line:84%
Oh. See, the founder of
Access, Gary Douglas,

00:37:51.937 --> 00:37:54.072 align:middle line:90%
he founded it 25 years ago.

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.209 align:middle line:84%
He started by the awareness
of things should be able

00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:58.643 align:middle line:84%
to be different and
we should have --

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and I know we have a capacity to
change, how do we actualize it,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.181 align:middle line:90%
how do we make it easier

00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
than it's ever been
on the planet before?

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.519 align:middle line:84%
And so he realized if he could
go to the point of creation

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:09.388 align:middle line:84%
of where something
started and this is

00:38:09.388 --> 00:38:11.656 align:middle line:84%
where the clearing statement
started, which is the POC

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.725 align:middle line:84%
in the clearing statement,
point of creation.

00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:16.261 align:middle line:84%
If you could go to the actual
point of creation of something

00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:18.964 align:middle line:84%
and unlock it from
there, it was kind of like

00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.599 align:middle line:90%
if you had this big oak tree.

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:22.534 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's say you're
walking down the trail

00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:25.303 align:middle line:84%
of your life and there's a
cliff to one side and there's,

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:27.639 align:middle line:84%
you know -- or a mountain on one
side and a cliff on the other

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.876 align:middle line:84%
and there's this big old tree in
the way and you don't know what

00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:33.111 align:middle line:84%
to do and you're like,
"Well, I could chop it down

00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:34.646 align:middle line:84%
and hope it doesn't
regrow later,"

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:39.351 align:middle line:84%
or what if you could actually
magically go back in time,

00:38:39.351 --> 00:38:42.587 align:middle line:84%
follow a leaf down the branch,
down all the way and go back

00:38:42.587 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
in time to where the seed
started, and vaporize the seed

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.193 align:middle line:84%
out of existence at its point
of creation before it decided

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:50.228 align:middle line:90%
to become a seed of limitation.

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:53.098 align:middle line:84%
It's like literally using
your choice to go back in time

00:38:53.098 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to change what you haven't
been able to change until now.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.868 align:middle line:90%
At a quantum level.

00:38:56.868 --> 00:38:58.737 align:middle line:90%
At a quantum level and beyond.

00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:00.739 align:middle line:90%
Is that -- and beyond.

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:03.942 align:middle line:84%
Is that where Access
Consciousness came from,

00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:90%
is another point in time?

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.651 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, another point in
time, or space, or something.

00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:13.452 align:middle line:90%
Another reality.

00:39:13.452 --> 00:39:15.454 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, truly another reality.

00:39:15.454 --> 00:39:19.291 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I haven't really
wanted to tell people that

00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:21.293 align:middle line:84%
or say that because people
make things significant

00:39:21.293 --> 00:39:22.661 align:middle line:84%
and they're like,
"What do you mean?"

00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Well, I just mean
it's not about the same thing

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.965 align:middle line:84%
that everything else
seems to be about.

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:27.899 align:middle line:90%
Everything else seems to be

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:29.935 align:middle line:84%
about getting this
reality right."

00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:32.771 align:middle line:84%
Our point of view
is if this reality,

00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:90%
what if you could go beyond it?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.775 align:middle line:84%
Because if this reality were
right, we would have figured it

00:39:36.775 --> 00:39:38.743 align:middle line:84%
out by now, we've been
doing it long enough.

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:39.978 align:middle line:90%
When I say this reality,

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:42.547 align:middle line:84%
I just mean the common every
ordinary everyday things

00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.583 align:middle line:84%
that we all believe
we have in common,

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:47.185 align:middle line:84%
that what if they didn't
have to be that way anymore?

00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Like limitations, scarcity...

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.555 align:middle line:90%
Struggle. ...judgment, struggle.

00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:53.091 align:middle line:84%
That's this reality in
a nutshell and its like,

00:39:53.091 --> 00:39:54.793 align:middle line:84%
"Why do we have to
live that way?"

00:39:54.793 --> 00:39:56.161 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to.

00:39:56.161 --> 00:40:00.465 align:middle line:84%
So it's about actually being
able to access our consciousness

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and our definition
of consciousness.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.503 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting,
a lot of the big names

00:40:04.503 --> 00:40:07.439 align:middle line:84%
in self-help and that who talk
about spirituality and love

00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:09.574 align:middle line:84%
for so many years are now
saying the same thing,

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:11.209 align:middle line:84%
but they're using the
world consciousness.

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:12.911 align:middle line:84%
Right. Except they don't
actually have a definition

00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.012 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:40:14.012 --> 00:40:15.413 align:middle line:84%
Right. So our definition
for consciousness is

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
where everything exists
and nothing is judged.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.051 align:middle line:84%
And what we know about
it is, it's the way

00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.721 align:middle line:84%
to undo every limitation
that you've ever had.

00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So this clearing statement,
the way it came about,

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.225 align:middle line:84%
was Gary looked and went, "If we
could literally go to the point

00:40:27.225 --> 00:40:28.827 align:middle line:84%
of creation, truly
go to the point

00:40:28.827 --> 00:40:31.229 align:middle line:84%
of creation energetically,"
he started seeing

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:34.099 align:middle line:84%
that he did it energetically
first and walked people back,

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:36.368 align:middle line:84%
and things that they had
had as physical problems,

00:40:36.368 --> 00:40:38.303 align:middle line:84%
emotional problems
just dissolved.

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:39.504 align:middle line:90%
That's how that works.

00:40:39.504 --> 00:40:42.574 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I have seen people
get out of wheelchairs...

00:40:42.574 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ...eyesight be corrected.

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:46.311 align:middle line:84%
Right. I've seen
phenomenal things...

00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:47.579 align:middle line:90%
Right. ...in your workshops.

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:49.147 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it -- it's
the coolest thing.

00:40:49.147 --> 00:40:50.615 align:middle line:84%
See, I get excited
because that...

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:53.118 align:middle line:84%
Oh. ...that's the joie de
vivre, you know what I mean?

00:40:53.118 --> 00:40:53.952 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles] Yeah.

00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a reason to be alive...

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.188 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...for these
miracles that can occur

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.291 align:middle line:84%
and so many people are
walking around in their lives

00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:03.595 align:middle line:84%
and they don't realize
miraculous living is right here.

00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:06.131 align:middle line:84%
It's just having the
invitation, the inspiration,

00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly, the
tools to make it happen.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.969 align:middle line:84%
So, Gary found that he
could change these things

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.137 align:middle line:84%
energetically and
then he's like,

00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.972 align:middle line:84%
"You know what there's
got to be a way.

00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:16.641 align:middle line:84%
I can go back and help people do
this energetically, he thought,

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.944 align:middle line:84%
but he's like I want
everybody to be able to do it.

00:41:18.944 --> 00:41:21.213 align:middle line:84%
What if I actually
matched this energy

00:41:21.213 --> 00:41:23.348 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of to words?"

00:41:23.348 --> 00:41:26.785 align:middle line:84%
And so he started by matching
it to words, and so it started

00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:30.155 align:middle line:84%
with this POC and POD, going
back to the point of creation.

00:41:30.155 --> 00:41:31.289 align:middle line:90%
Uh-hum, uh-hum.

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:32.591 align:middle line:84%
That's the short form
of a clearing statement.

00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:33.825 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to do all
those weird words I said,

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:35.961 align:middle line:84%
you go POC and POD all that
and it will still work.

00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:37.362 align:middle line:84%
Point of creation --
point of destruction.

00:41:37.362 --> 00:41:38.997 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. POC, POD.

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.601 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Now I've always wondered
why you have the different terms

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:44.603 align:middle line:84%
and questions that you
ask because if I tried

00:41:44.603 --> 00:41:47.372 align:middle line:84%
to ask those questions,
I would scramble them.

00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:50.375 align:middle line:84%
They confuse me sometimes, which
I think is intentional, right?

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:52.244 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it actually is
because what it's designed

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:54.512 align:middle line:84%
to do is go beyond
your logical mind.

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:57.015 align:middle line:84%
See, your logical mind is the
thing that's created every

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.717 align:middle line:90%
limitation you have.

00:41:58.717 --> 00:42:01.186 align:middle line:84%
True. What we're doing is we're
going beyond the logical mind

00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:03.555 align:middle line:84%
because your mind is
like a big card catalog.

00:42:03.555 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember in libraries, before
computers, when they used

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.992 align:middle line:84%
to have the big old
card catalogs?

00:42:06.992 --> 00:42:08.059 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes [chuckles].

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.028 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is like a
big old card catalog

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.497 align:middle line:84%
and when it receives a new
piece of information it checks

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:14.132 align:middle line:84%
through every card
in that catalog,

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:17.502 align:middle line:84%
and if it hasn't already
stamped it okay, it goes reject,

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.437 align:middle line:90%
bad, wrong, don't do it.

00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:21.973 align:middle line:84%
So some of the greatest things
that could create miracles

00:42:21.973 --> 00:42:25.143 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, we have rejected
because our mind has said, "Oh,

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:26.678 align:middle line:90%
that's not our reality."

00:42:26.678 --> 00:42:27.912 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, "Yeah, but what

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:30.282 align:middle line:84%
if it could be what created
a far greater reality?"

00:42:30.282 --> 00:42:33.051 align:middle line:84%
Our mind has been limiting
us for far too long.

00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.786 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there are people
that have the point of view

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:36.421 align:middle line:90%
"I think therefore I am,"

00:42:36.421 --> 00:42:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and how much fun are
they to be around?

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:39.124 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:42:39.124 --> 00:42:40.225 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:41.359 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, yes.

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:43.295 align:middle line:84%
We know. A little too
much thinking, you know?

00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:43.828 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yes.

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:44.763 align:middle line:90%
So what's...

00:42:44.763 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Happens usually when
you go home.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.798 align:middle line:90%
You find that [laughter].

00:42:46.798 --> 00:42:48.099 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:50.835 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
about that was I had a lady

00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:53.838 align:middle line:84%
who sent me an email and she
said, "Thank you so much."

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I had done
a call about dealing

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.275 align:middle line:90%
with family at holiday season.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:00.345 align:middle line:84%
She said, "This is the first
time I've ever gone to my family

00:43:00.345 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and felt totally at peace.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.181 align:middle line:90%
I didn't cut off any part of me.

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:06.418 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy and my mom
came up and gave me a hug

00:43:06.418 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in six years."

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.188 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Really?"

00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:12.657 align:middle line:90%
Wow. Interesting change.

00:43:12.657 --> 00:43:13.725 align:middle line:90%
Yes [laughter].

00:43:13.725 --> 00:43:15.794 align:middle line:84%
But that's just part
of what can change.

00:43:15.794 --> 00:43:19.097 align:middle line:90%
If you were to envision a world

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:24.669 align:middle line:84%
that everybody understood
what you're talking about,

00:43:24.669 --> 00:43:29.374 align:middle line:90%
what would that world look like?

00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:31.776 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Well, okay,
you got me with that one.

00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:34.979 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the world
would have no borders

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:37.382 align:middle line:90%
between people or countries.

00:43:37.382 --> 00:43:40.719 align:middle line:84%
We would be able to embrace each
other arm and arm, hand in hand,

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:43.588 align:middle line:90%
see the beauty of each of us.

00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:46.257 align:middle line:84%
And when one of our brothers
or sisters didn't see it

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:48.760 align:middle line:84%
or were feeling downtrodden,
our awareness

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.096 align:middle line:84%
of their beauty would
be able to lift them up

00:43:51.096 --> 00:43:52.464 align:middle line:84%
and they'd actually
have the willingness

00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.265 align:middle line:90%
and capacity to receive it.

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:56.201 align:middle line:84%
We would actually see
the greatness in others,

00:43:56.201 --> 00:43:58.436 align:middle line:84%
rather than look to
judge them first.

00:43:58.436 --> 00:44:00.371 align:middle line:84%
We'd see the greatness
in ourselves

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.908 align:middle line:84%
and we'd actually receive
that we are a gift here.

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:06.544 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but we would
have a far greater connection

00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.812 align:middle line:90%
with this planet.

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:10.315 align:middle line:84%
We would actually ask the
planet before doing things

00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.417 align:middle line:90%
like putting thousands of tons

00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:14.619 align:middle line:84%
of concrete on earthquake
faults.

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:16.454 align:middle line:84%
We would go, "Hey earth, if
we do this, is this going

00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:17.922 align:middle line:90%
to work out well for us?

00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:21.126 align:middle line:84%
And earth, would you please
look after our stuff?"

00:44:21.126 --> 00:44:24.529 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the idea that this
kind of connection is possible,

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:26.898 align:middle line:84%
but in the world that
I see as possible,

00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:90%
there'd be such connection

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.336 align:middle line:84%
that it would flow
through everything.

00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What about killing, and murder,
and thievery, and all that?

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.509 align:middle line:84%
I know we've gotten off the
money topic for a second...

00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:38.843 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...but this
is good [chuckles].

00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:40.145 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:42.614 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because in
a world of consciousness,

00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:43.848 align:middle line:90%
could those things exist?

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.250 align:middle line:90%
No, you would hope not.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.219 align:middle line:84%
No. Well, no it can't because
that's the furthest end

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:50.955 align:middle line:84%
of anticonsciousness
and unconsciousness.

00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:52.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the furthest end of it...

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.894 align:middle line:84%
True. ...murder, genocide,
slavery, all the things

00:44:55.894 --> 00:44:57.362 align:middle line:84%
that we know we'd
like to change.

00:44:57.362 --> 00:44:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Those aren't judgments?

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.799 align:middle line:90%
No, that's an awareness.

00:45:00.799 --> 00:45:02.133 align:middle line:90%
Difference?

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:03.334 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
judgment and awareness?

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:03.968 align:middle line:84%
Well, judgment is where
you actually have a point

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:05.336 align:middle line:90%
of view about it.

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:07.806 align:middle line:84%
An awareness is, you can have
an awareness for example...

00:45:07.806 --> 00:45:08.873 align:middle line:90%
Oh, with no point of view.

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.308 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, with no point of view.

00:45:10.308 --> 00:45:12.544 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, you can even
look and see someone and go wow,

00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:16.247 align:middle line:84%
they're really selfish, but
that's not necessarily judgment.

00:45:16.247 --> 00:45:17.615 align:middle line:84%
We've misidentified
and misapplied

00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:19.717 align:middle line:84%
that if we have an awareness
like that, that it's a judgment

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:23.254 align:middle line:84%
because it seems negative
and our positive point

00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:26.257 align:middle line:84%
of view is not like, "Oh
they're so beautiful,"

00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:28.059 align:middle line:90%
or, "They're perfect."

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.694 align:middle line:84%
What if those could
be judgments.

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So the judgments are the
things that hook you.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.698 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. But the
awarenesses are the things

00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:35.066 align:middle line:84%
that you look at
from a distance.

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.301 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:38.803 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And so if you realize
that then you realize

00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:40.205 align:middle line:84%
that wait a minute, there's
a whole different way

00:45:40.205 --> 00:45:40.738 align:middle line:90%
of being in the world.

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:41.773 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:43.107 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. That's huge.

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:45.443 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So take that -- apply
that conversation to money.

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:50.815 align:middle line:84%
A judgment of money would --
would say that you're resistant

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:53.885 align:middle line:84%
to it, but an awareness
of money would embrace it?

00:45:53.885 --> 00:45:57.422 align:middle line:84%
Exactly and it -- if you get
over your judgments you --

00:45:57.422 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:90%
if you did nothing else other

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.091 align:middle line:84%
than make the demand
you're going to get

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:02.694 align:middle line:84%
over your judgments,
especially of you,

00:46:02.694 --> 00:46:04.229 align:middle line:84%
because that's the one
thing you'll judge more

00:46:04.229 --> 00:46:06.531 align:middle line:84%
than anything else
and then everything --

00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:08.733 align:middle line:84%
everyone and everything
else literally you start

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:11.936 align:middle line:84%
to receive money far more
easily than you ever imagined

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.239 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't have
the barriers up anymore.

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:16.174 align:middle line:84%
What most people do is they
live behind these walls

00:46:16.174 --> 00:46:17.575 align:middle line:90%
and these barriers, and they're

00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:19.911 align:middle line:84%
so defended all the time
thinking that they've got

00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:22.313 align:middle line:84%
to protect themselves
in order to live here.

00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:25.550 align:middle line:84%
In the world I envision, the
walls and the barriers come down

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.784 align:middle line:90%
and we embrace each other

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and embrace the possibilities
that are available.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.889 align:middle line:84%
And money is just
an afterthought,

00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:33.725 align:middle line:84%
which is everywhere for the
taking and not the taking,

00:46:33.725 --> 00:46:36.861 align:middle line:84%
but the receiving, the
gifting and receiving.

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:40.798 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that -- that --
that got me [laughter].

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:44.869 align:middle line:84%
Something in there
got stuck and that --

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:47.605 align:middle line:84%
I realized after I said
that about the judgments.

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.274 align:middle line:90%
Here's a perfect example.

00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:55.046 align:middle line:84%
Is -- once you get through
a certain layer of judgment

00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:57.782 align:middle line:84%
and you realize you have a
judgment about something,

00:46:57.782 --> 00:47:01.152 align:middle line:84%
it opens up the space to look at
the other layers that you have.

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:04.689 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah and if you can
do it without judgment,

00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:07.859 align:middle line:84%
if you can look and go, "Wow,
I realize I'm judging this,"

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:11.696 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up in a world
where I learned to judge first

00:47:11.696 --> 00:47:15.233 align:middle line:84%
and ask questions later if at
all, and realize you learn --

00:47:15.233 --> 00:47:16.534 align:middle line:90%
you grew up in that world.

00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
And what if you can look at
your judgment and the fact

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.306 align:middle line:84%
that you have judgments
without judgment?

00:47:21.306 --> 00:47:23.708 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles] Wow, it's a process.

00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.176 align:middle line:90%
It's a delayering process.

00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:26.511 align:middle line:90%
It is. But it's a...

00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:27.845 align:middle line:90%
It's a freeing process.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:31.616 align:middle line:84%
It is. It's a joyful, freeing
process of possibilities.

00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:33.384 align:middle line:84%
Because once you call
attention to the fact

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that there's judgments
beyond your judgments

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.221 align:middle line:84%
and then you realize
that you're starting

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:39.123 align:middle line:90%
to delayer those judgments...

00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...unravel
them, get to the seed

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:84%
from where they started, and
then disappear that back --

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.933 align:middle line:84%
back in time, from
whence it came...

00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:50.702 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...that's a
statement that you have, too.

00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Return it to whence
it came, right?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.539 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, when you have
those weird voices in your head

00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:57.408 align:middle line:84%
that tell you that you can't
or the energies that say,"

00:47:57.408 --> 00:47:59.711 align:middle line:84%
Oh you're bad, you're
wrong, you're terrible."

00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.347 align:middle line:84%
You go -- go back to from
whence you came, never to return

00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:03.848 align:middle line:90%
to me or this reality.

00:48:03.848 --> 00:48:06.718 align:middle line:84%
Go back to from whence
you came, never to return

00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:08.186 align:middle line:90%
to me or this reality.

00:48:08.186 --> 00:48:10.254 align:middle line:84%
Go back to from whence
you came, never to return

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.456 align:middle line:90%
to me or this reality.

00:48:11.456 --> 00:48:13.424 align:middle line:84%
Go back to from whence
you came, never to return

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:14.625 align:middle line:90%
to me or this reality.

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.394 align:middle line:84%
Go back to from whence
you came, never to return

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:17.795 align:middle line:90%
to me or this reality.

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:20.965 align:middle line:84%
As many times as it take to get
a sense of space and openness.

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:23.868 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
it's almost like people

00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:25.837 align:middle line:84%
out there, as I'm doing
that, are going, "Oh,"

00:48:25.837 --> 00:48:28.339 align:middle line:90%
like it lightens up your world.

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:29.407 align:middle line:90%
I felt that instantly...

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.775 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that's...

00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:34.078 align:middle line:84%
>...around the fourth
time you said it...

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:36.514 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. ...I felt it, yes, yes.

00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:39.083 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
is all about.

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.686 align:middle line:84%
Imagine living from
that lightness,

00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:44.155 align:middle line:84%
but not from disconnecting
from this reality,

00:48:44.155 --> 00:48:47.659 align:middle line:84%
not from disconnecting from
the wonderful things here,

00:48:47.659 --> 00:48:50.661 align:middle line:84%
but by embracing them all
and embracing them all

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:54.699 align:middle line:84%
with no judgment, and
embracing everything else you'd

00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:90%
like to choose here.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.369 align:middle line:90%
Because what I'm saying is not,

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:00.038 align:middle line:84%
"Let's go live on
another planet.

00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:01.539 align:middle line:90%
Let's go live on a mountain."

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying there are wonderful
things like chili burgers

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.779 align:middle line:84%
and ice cream, and
motorcycles, and jet skis,

00:49:07.779 --> 00:49:12.517 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful parks, and I
mean just -- beautiful animals.

00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:84%
They're amazing things
to live with here.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:17.021 align:middle line:90%
Let's not discount all of that.

00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:20.425 align:middle line:84%
Let's get over our judgments
and get over our points of view,

00:49:20.425 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:84%
and get over our
unwillingness to receive

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
so we can experience it all even
greater and create the money

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:31.235 align:middle line:84%
so we can create it and have it
too, and also change the world.

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:32.437 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes, hear, hear.

00:49:32.437 --> 00:49:33.638 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's take a
look at that [laughter] --

00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:36.741 align:middle line:84%
another video from Dain
here as he's talking

00:49:36.741 --> 00:49:39.977 align:middle line:90%
in Dublin, Ireland again.

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:40.778 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:41.846 align:middle line:90%
...[inaudible].

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:42.747 align:middle line:84%
Okay, when I came back
to my normal life,

00:49:42.747 --> 00:49:43.748 align:middle line:90%
notice the point of view.

00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:46.184 align:middle line:84%
Here's what you've
got to get, guys,

00:49:46.184 --> 00:49:48.086 align:middle line:84%
your point of view
creates your reality.

00:49:48.086 --> 00:49:49.754 align:middle line:84%
Reality does not create
your point of view.

00:49:49.754 --> 00:49:52.557 align:middle line:84%
Your point of view
creates your reality.

00:49:52.557 --> 00:49:54.659 align:middle line:84%
Reality does not create
your point of view.

00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:57.428 align:middle line:84%
So when you go, "I came
back to my normal life,"

00:49:57.428 --> 00:49:58.429 align:middle line:90%
what have you just created?

00:49:58.429 --> 00:49:59.664 align:middle line:84%
You just created
going back number one

00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
to where you were before
you went to your meditation

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.033 align:middle line:84%
and got a glimpse of you, and
now you have to be normal.

00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:03.434 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the thing.

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:04.836 align:middle line:84%
You look at that and go, "Well,
why are you even having this --

00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:06.204 align:middle line:84%
," because that's exactly the
point of view that's creating

00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:07.405 align:middle line:84%
that reality and if you can
POD and POC the point of view,

00:50:07.405 --> 00:50:08.473 align:middle line:84%
what happens is rather
than going back and rather

00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:09.407 align:middle line:84%
than having to be
normal, you go forward

00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:11.109 align:middle line:84%
into a phenomenal
life and living.

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:13.277 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:17.181 align:middle line:84%
Now please, this is the stuff
that is sticking us right here.

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:19.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff right
here that is sticking us.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.418 align:middle line:84%
That is why I'm having
the conversation.

00:50:20.418 --> 00:50:22.687 align:middle line:84%
If it were irrelevant, I
wouldn't talk about it.

00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:24.255 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't address it.

00:50:24.255 --> 00:50:26.891 align:middle line:84%
Okay? You've got to get this is
the same thing that's sticking

00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:28.092 align:middle line:90%
you with money.

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:30.428 align:middle line:84%
Same thing that's sticking
you as when you go, "Oh,

00:50:30.428 --> 00:50:32.897 align:middle line:84%
I've got to go back
to my family now.

00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.199 align:middle line:84%
I've got to go back
to my job now."

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:37.301 align:middle line:84%
No, you don't ever
want to go back.

00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:38.402 align:middle line:90%
You want to go forward and go,

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:39.704 align:middle line:84%
"How does it get any
better than this."

00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:42.373 align:middle line:84%
And the people that actually
do this, who don't think,

00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:84%
"Oh it's just semantic fluff
and it's just semantics,

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.245 align:middle line:84%
and it's just semantic
crap," the people

00:50:47.245 --> 00:50:49.847 align:middle line:84%
that actually do this,
their lives start changing

00:50:49.847 --> 00:50:53.851 align:middle line:84%
and their money starts changing,
money flows starts changing.

00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So please, the only
reason I'm --

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.024 align:middle line:84%
I would not talk about it
I it were not relevant.

00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:03.594 align:middle line:84%
Being in this conversation
is so empowering because it,

00:51:03.594 --> 00:51:05.763 align:middle line:84%
again [chuckles], you
explained it perfectly.

00:51:05.763 --> 00:51:07.832 align:middle line:84%
It's not from this
reality, but it needs

00:51:07.832 --> 00:51:09.467 align:middle line:84%
to become this reality
[laughter].

00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:10.701 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, truly.

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. One of the interesting
things Gary Douglas --

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.139 align:middle line:84%
when he said -- one of
the first things he said

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:16.541 align:middle line:90%
to me, he said, "You know?"

00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:18.709 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Gary you're doing this
great stuff that's changing a

00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:19.944 align:middle line:90%
lot of people's lives.

00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:21.345 align:middle line:84%
Like what's a measure
of success for you?"

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:22.747 align:middle line:90%
He said, "You know what?

00:51:22.747 --> 00:51:24.148 align:middle line:90%
Two things -- ."

00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, " I know I'm a success
if I change one person's life

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.618 align:middle line:84%
for the greater because
they will go

00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:29.020 align:middle line:90%
out and change the world.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.022 align:middle line:84%
Second, I'll know I'm a
success when everybody

00:51:31.022 --> 00:51:34.659 align:middle line:84%
on the planet is using these
tools and nobody knows my name."

00:51:34.659 --> 00:51:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And I went, "Wow.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.329 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so you really don't care
if anybody knows your name?"

00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:41.265 align:middle line:84%
He's like, "No, I just want
people to have access to this."

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the
same point of view.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.535 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if anybody
knows my name.

00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:46.337 align:middle line:90%
I want them to know their name.

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:47.438 align:middle line:90%
You know? Yeah.

00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:49.407 align:middle line:84%
Truly, it's like --
that changes the world.

00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:53.711 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've noticed that there
are a lot of spiritual teachers

00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:56.214 align:middle line:90%
on the horizon lately.

00:51:56.214 --> 00:51:59.183 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And they come
in with an ego

00:51:59.183 --> 00:52:04.322 align:middle line:84%
so that you know it's their
material, their message

00:52:04.322 --> 00:52:06.891 align:middle line:84%
and it is -- there's
definitely --

00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this lately
as a separation...

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.329 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...a separation
and it's a separation

00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:14.799 align:middle line:84%
and I don't understand
it sometimes.

00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:17.702 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's also because
what you're looking

00:52:17.702 --> 00:52:19.270 align:middle line:90%
to do is empower people.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:20.504 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:23.941 align:middle line:84%
that happens is we don't
see how people can function

00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:26.944 align:middle line:84%
from such a totally
different reality than we do.

00:52:26.944 --> 00:52:28.446 align:middle line:84%
You know, you would
look and you'd go,

00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:30.314 align:middle line:84%
"Why would you not
just empower people?

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:31.949 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we all just get along?

00:52:31.949 --> 00:52:33.618 align:middle line:84%
Why won't you show them
the greatness of them?"

00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:35.886 align:middle line:84%
Well, their reality is
something totally different.

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.022 align:middle line:84%
So how do you deal with
that when you're in a job

00:52:38.022 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:84%
where you have someone
who's got a --

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.859 align:middle line:84%
big ego and you don't
want to play [chuckles]?

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:43.327 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:46.664 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's all kinds of
tools that we have available.

00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:48.733 align:middle line:84%
One is there's a
clearing that you can use.

00:52:48.733 --> 00:52:51.802 align:middle line:84%
You can say, "What
stupidity and I'm using it

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:55.039 align:middle line:84%
to create the resistance
I am choosing."

00:52:55.039 --> 00:52:56.073 align:middle line:90%
And when it...

00:52:56.073 --> 00:52:56.774 align:middle line:84%
So you take -- put
it back on yourself?

00:52:56.774 --> 00:52:58.109 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay.

00:52:58.109 --> 00:53:00.645 align:middle line:84%
But it's not -- it's more like
in order for you to resist

00:53:00.645 --> 00:53:02.546 align:middle line:84%
and react -- and when I
say stupidity I don't mean

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.415 align:middle line:84%
that you're stupid, please
don't take it that way.

00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:06.717 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. What it is, is you're
actually way more aware

00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:08.486 align:middle line:84%
than you've given
yourself credit for.

00:53:08.486 --> 00:53:10.488 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is you're
saying what unawareness am

00:53:10.488 --> 00:53:11.322 align:middle line:90%
I using...

00:53:11.322 --> 00:53:13.557 align:middle line:90%
Okay. ...to resist this jerk?

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:14.258 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Ahh.

00:53:14.258 --> 00:53:15.660 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.361 align:middle line:84%
Why -- like why would -- just
because somebody has a big ego

00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're arrogant, why would
I have to resist and react

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.632 align:middle line:90%
to that if I've got me.

00:53:21.632 --> 00:53:23.701 align:middle line:84%
So you go what, "Stupidity
am I using

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to create the resistance I
am choosing; right and wrong,

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.539 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, POC and POD, all
nine, shorts boys and beyond.

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:29.807 align:middle line:90%
POD and POC all that."

00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And then one other tool that's
probably even more valid

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.681 align:middle line:84%
in a wider range of situations
is you look and you get

00:53:36.681 --> 00:53:40.017 align:middle line:84%
that energy, that resistance,
or those barriers that come up

00:53:40.017 --> 00:53:41.919 align:middle line:84%
and just say to that
energy, "Interesting point

00:53:41.919 --> 00:53:43.454 align:middle line:84%
of view I have this
point of view."

00:53:43.454 --> 00:53:45.823 align:middle line:84%
Uh-huh. Then again,
"Interesting point of view.

00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:47.658 align:middle line:84%
I have this point of view,"
and it should shift each time.

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:49.327 align:middle line:84%
And then you go,
"Interesting point of view.

00:53:49.327 --> 00:53:50.628 align:middle line:90%
I have this point of view.

00:53:50.628 --> 00:53:51.996 align:middle line:84%
Interesting point of view,
I have this point of view,"

00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:54.298 align:middle line:84%
and after four times
it's usually gone.

00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:56.534 align:middle line:84%
What about the 1%
conversation --

00:53:56.534 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the 99% talking about the
1% having all the money

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.006 align:middle line:84%
in the world and then
destroying the planet?

00:54:02.006 --> 00:54:04.742 align:middle line:84%
Is that a judgment and
how do you clear that?

00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Here's my question.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.812 align:middle line:84%
Does it make you feel lighter
when you talk about it?

00:54:07.812 --> 00:54:10.047 align:middle line:84%
When I hear about it on
the radio, it doesn't seem

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:11.916 align:middle line:84%
like the people talking
about it feel any lighter.

00:54:11.916 --> 00:54:13.684 align:middle line:84%
No, they definitely
do not feel lighter.

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:15.619 align:middle line:84%
And what they're doing
is they're going, "Oh,

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:18.622 align:middle line:84%
it's a conspiracy and these
people are holding us down."

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.558 align:middle line:84%
Well, just in taking
that point of view --

00:54:20.558 --> 00:54:23.060 align:middle line:84%
remember, your point of
view creates your reality --

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.395 align:middle line:90%
just in taking that point

00:54:24.395 --> 00:54:27.531 align:middle line:84%
of view they have just made
themselves less than people

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.568 align:middle line:84%
who have money, which means that
they've just taken themselves

00:54:30.568 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
out of being able to be
the people who have money.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.007 align:middle line:84%
But if they were willing to
be the people who have money,

00:54:36.007 --> 00:54:37.241 align:middle line:90%
they could have enough money

00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to undo what they think
the other people are doing.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.446 align:middle line:84%
Maybe -- what if money isn't
necessarily the end goal,

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:45.783 align:middle line:84%
but it's the essence of
wealth and abundance,

00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:47.551 align:middle line:84%
and personal joy
that is the angle.

00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:48.319 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:49.553 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, really, right?

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:52.656 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, yeah, and that's
the thing is it truly --

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:56.027 align:middle line:84%
once again, money follows
joy and like you said,

00:54:56.027 --> 00:54:58.129 align:middle line:84%
what if money isn't
actually the target.

00:54:58.129 --> 00:54:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Right, what if joy
is [laughter].

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:00.331 align:middle line:90%
What if it's actually living.

00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:02.099 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly, what if joy
is actually your target?

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:05.102 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So if joy is actually
your target, you -- you make --

00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:07.738 align:middle line:84%
you do things from a
totally different place.

00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:09.306 align:middle line:84%
But once again I
want to say this,

00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:11.809 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be practical
and pragmatic.

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:13.944 align:middle line:84%
See a lot of people go, "Well
I'm just going to be joyful

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:15.479 align:middle line:84%
so I'm never going
to work again."

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:18.382 align:middle line:84%
Is that really joyful or did
you come to the conclusion

00:55:18.382 --> 00:55:19.950 align:middle line:90%
that that's what you would do,

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.019 align:middle line:84%
that's the only time
you could be joyful.

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:24.188 align:middle line:84%
For me, I love the
work that I do.

00:55:24.188 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:84%
What about going to a job
that you don't like in order

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.359 align:middle line:90%
to get the money to be joyful?

00:55:28.359 --> 00:55:30.194 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now what you've
got to look at in

00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:33.164 align:middle line:84%
that is does this job you
give you enough money?

00:55:33.164 --> 00:55:36.333 align:middle line:84%
Is it paying you enough to do
something you don't want to do?

00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:39.503 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, in the short
term -- no problem...

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:40.704 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:43.207 align:middle line:84%
...if it's not, don't just
go quit the job to prove

00:55:43.207 --> 00:55:45.242 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
something different now.

00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:47.011 align:middle line:84%
Once again, be practical
and pragmatic.

00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:49.413 align:middle line:84%
Look at it and go, "Okay,
I just finally am willing

00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:51.048 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge this job
doesn't work for me."

00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:52.917 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's being
present with what is

00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:55.019 align:middle line:84%
and then you ask the question,
"What's it going to take

00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:58.055 align:middle line:84%
to change this,"
and then, "Universe,

00:55:58.055 --> 00:55:59.924 align:middle line:90%
what have you got for me?

00:55:59.924 --> 00:56:01.058 align:middle line:90%
Show me something different."

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:04.161 align:middle line:84%
Do that exercise of what
you would like to create

00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:05.930 align:middle line:84%
as the energy of
what it would be.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:07.164 align:middle line:84%
You know, the exercise we
did with the energy here.

00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:08.833 align:middle line:90%
That was a great exercise, yes.

00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:11.335 align:middle line:84%
That's a way to know --
now here's the thing,

00:56:11.335 --> 00:56:13.204 align:middle line:90%
that has an energy to it, right?

00:56:13.204 --> 00:56:15.673 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in this job that
you don't like, what you want

00:56:15.673 --> 00:56:17.341 align:middle line:84%
to do is you want to
start looking for things

00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:18.776 align:middle line:90%
that have more of that energy.

00:56:18.776 --> 00:56:20.277 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
somebody invites you

00:56:20.277 --> 00:56:21.912 align:middle line:90%
to New York for example.

00:56:21.912 --> 00:56:23.013 align:middle line:84%
They're like, "Hey,
do you want to come

00:56:23.013 --> 00:56:23.747 align:middle line:90%
to New York for a weekend?

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.115 align:middle line:90%
I'll buy you a ticket."

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.350 align:middle line:84%
You're like, "Wow, it feels
just like that energy, sure."

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.786 align:middle line:84%
While you're there, you meet
somebody who has a yacht

00:56:28.786 --> 00:56:30.988 align:middle line:84%
and they need somebody to direct
their -- you know what I mean?

00:56:30.988 --> 00:56:32.456 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes. But that's --

00:56:32.456 --> 00:56:35.092 align:middle line:84%
this thing, this one
tool is actually a way

00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:38.028 align:middle line:84%
of knowing the energy
to follow to get

00:56:38.028 --> 00:56:39.196 align:middle line:90%
where you would like to go.

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:42.533 align:middle line:84%
And you took the focus
off of hating the job...

00:56:42.533 --> 00:56:44.768 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...disappointment
with what is.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.371 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You've opened it up to
possibilities and maybe you got

00:56:47.371 --> 00:56:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that phone call to New York
because you were at your desk

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.307 align:middle line:90%
at the job you hate [laughter].

00:56:50.307 --> 00:56:51.675 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:52.943 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't matter anymore...

00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:54.945 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...because it led
to another possibility.

00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:56.547 align:middle line:90%
Yes. So the bottom line is

00:56:56.547 --> 00:56:58.782 align:middle line:84%
to keep your mind open
to the possibilities.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.317 align:middle line:84%
Keep your mind open
to the possibilities.

00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:01.886 align:middle line:90%
Keep asking the questions.

00:57:01.886 --> 00:57:03.587 align:middle line:84%
And POC and POD everything
that gets

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:04.889 align:middle line:84%
in your way, you
know [laughter].

00:57:04.889 --> 00:57:08.926 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know -- and I
say play with these tools.

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:10.861 align:middle line:84%
Take them and just use
them, and see how they work.

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:12.663 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't tell you the
number of emails I've gotten

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:84%
from people who say, "Oh my
gosh; I played with this tool

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:17.668 align:middle line:84%
and it totally changed
something."

00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:20.271 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're very
humble, but I have seen you

00:57:20.271 --> 00:57:24.742 align:middle line:84%
in workshops just take
people out of wheelchairs.

00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:27.945 align:middle line:84%
I've seen you bring passion
into somebody's entire body.

00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:32.783 align:middle line:84%
I've seen things happen
that are incredible.

00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:33.617 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:34.718 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:36.854 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
being with us again.

00:57:36.854 --> 00:57:37.922 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:37.922 --> 00:57:39.123 align:middle line:90%
And -- absolutely.

00:57:39.123 --> 00:57:40.991 align:middle line:84%
The audience loved you
so much they wanted more,

00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.393 align:middle line:90%
wanted to hear more...

00:57:42.393 --> 00:57:44.862 align:middle line:84%
Hey. ...because this is so new
and different for many people.

00:57:44.862 --> 00:57:48.432 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for being
here and thank you so much

00:57:48.432 --> 00:57:50.534 align:middle line:84%
for being here, as well and
