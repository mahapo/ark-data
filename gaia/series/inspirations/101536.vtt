00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.809 align:middle line:90%
I'm.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to wake up
our true meaning of life.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the soul shift
that my guest today

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
talks about in her latest
book called "Soul Shifts."

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Barbara DeAngelis is one of
the most influential teachers

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:84%
of our time in the field
of personal development.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And for 25 years, she has
reached tens of millions

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:90%
of people throughout the world.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
She has 14 bestselling
books to her credit,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
selling over 10 million copies.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
So great to have you here today.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.241 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA DEANGELIS: I am
so thrilled to be here.

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So thrilled to be with such a
conscious audience watching us,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.912 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have a soul
shifting journey together.

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Soul shifting
conversation.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, did it take
you a while to write this book?

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like it has
so much of your work in it,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
yet it takes people to a whole
other level at the same time.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.104 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: It does.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
It's my 15th book.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And
it's really there

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to not just alchemize
everything and put it together,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
but to be a practical handbook,
a manual for people for what

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.262 align:middle line:90%
I call practical spirituality.

00:01:18.262 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I've written a lot of
books about spirituality,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:90%
about relationships.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to write a
guidebook, in a sense,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
so that people
could have a manual.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say, I want
to grow, I want to shift,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to think positive.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But how do you do
that day by day?

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.229 align:middle line:84%
All of us have our soul shifts
and our great high moments,

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
when maybe we're
meditating, or we're

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:84%
doing yoga, or
watching your program,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
listening to your
great radio show.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens afterwards?

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we're with
the person we love.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, we're at work.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
consciousness go?

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to have
a taste of something.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you integrate it?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote "Soul Shifts"
because I really do

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
believe-- and I think you and
I have talked about this--

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a very
powerful, accelerated time

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of transformation,
where a lot of people

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
are having what I call
the divine discomfort.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:90%
They've achieved a lot.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:90%
They understand a lot.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:90%
There's something missing.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a restlessness
to go faster.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that is something
calling to us to truly shift,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and to help other people shift.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Since I've been doing
that for decades,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I really felt it was
my time to do that.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And I waited eight years
to write "Soul Shifts,"

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.195 align:middle line:90%
the longest time between books.

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I've written so many books.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was the next
book, the next book.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Something said, stop,
go even deeper inside.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Work with my community
of people who I teach,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and get everything so distilled
that people can read the book

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:90%
and get the transmission.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.319 align:middle line:84%
And the response has been
so overwhelming to me,

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
more than any book
I've ever written.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It debuted number one spiritual
book on Amazon and Kindle.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And people are feeling the shift
in the vibration in the book,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:84%
not just the information,
but the transformation.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken
them on a journey.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And even the people,
if they read it,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
if they hear me on the radio, or
if they're watching right now,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
it means you are
the soul shifters.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You are the people who are
here to really transform

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:90%
everybody else.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So it is, as you
said beautifully,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.009 align:middle line:90%
it's time to wake up.

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.592 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not just
another book on purpose.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And yes, if you've been
on your personal journey

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
for a little while
now, you're done

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:90%
with that type of conversation.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, I got my purpose, and
now I'm working my butt off

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.732 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill that purpose, and
I'm losing myself in my purpose.

00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Or that there's
a collision between-- we

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:90%
all have our highest.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.676 align:middle line:84%
We've all had moments
of our highest.

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And then we
have moments of our lowest.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And then there's
everything in between.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
My premise is if you
can experience yourself

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the most conscious, the most
loving, the most identified

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
with the expanded part of
you, that means it's there.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing missing in you.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
people need to get.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we
need to get more,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
it's that we disconnect
from that highest.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:90%
What gets in the way?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.609 align:middle line:90%
What unplugs us?

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or pulls us back?

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.191 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Pulls
us back, or what I

00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.852 align:middle line:90%
call drifting from our highest.

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And we all know what
drifting feels like.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
You drift a little bit one
day, but it's not so bad.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
you're depressed.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't just happen.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And the premise of
"Soul Shifts" is

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to wait for a
traumatic event, or an a-ha,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
or a trip to Peru, or whatever
it is to have a soul shift.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.542 align:middle line:84%
You can have that any moment if
you understand the principles.

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what the readers
have been experiencing.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you can have many.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.567 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's plural.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: That's why
it's-- it's not one thing.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It's plural, and you can have
many in a day, in a moment.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
One practice that
I teach, you can

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
shift in a second out of a
very contracted state to a more

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
expanded state, and
that's what's so powerful.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's been so wonderful
for me because, as you know,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
it's one thing to
teach something,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to write it,
to practice it yourself.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody you've
never heard of from Alaska,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
or Italy, or Japan is
writing me, saying I'm

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
on chapter three, and I
completely just rearranged

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
my understanding of myself.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I just let go of something
I've carried for 25 years.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I am shifting.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
My relationship with
my kids is shifting.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
understand why yet.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, I know that I've
done good service.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this definitely
happens in my life as well.

00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And I host a radio show every
day around transformation,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
so that's my chance
every single day

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:90%
to get back into that space.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is
that every single day, I have

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:90%
to get back into that space.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is a familiar
conversation with you,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So I really paid
attention to the things

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that pull me off that track.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.225 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to be
unconscious conversations.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Correct.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not just mundane
bills, and things like that.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.466 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: No.

00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's things that
are hurtful, or go wrong,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
or that people say, or
that aren't working.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And those tend to
pull me off my track.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.078 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: They pull
you off your track

00:06:07.078 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because they're what I
call a disappointment

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and disconnection in spirit.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
something really deeply

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and meaningful for you, and
really, for everybody watching.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said,
if you're watching,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
you are part of the
cosmic advance team,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and that means we're
here to do something.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.837 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: One of
the deepest wounds

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.459 align:middle line:84%
people on a spiritual
path have-- and you

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
can be in a spiritual path
whether you've done it

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
for 45 years like I have, or
you just started recently,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and you just discovered this TV
program-- is facing the reality

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:90%
of this world as it is.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The heartbreak of
the insensitivity.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
The heartbreak of the world.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
The heartbreak of
the unconsciousness.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Many people who grew up,
and they were seekers,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know
what the word meant,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.527 align:middle line:84%
had a hard childhood even,
or a hard adolescence,

00:06:57.527 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
because they thought,
what's wrong with the world?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.276 align:middle line:90%
It's screwed up.

00:07:00.276 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are people so mean?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And it can create depression.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It can create a feeling of,
I don't want to do this.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It can create coldness
or detachment,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's
the pain of saying,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I know it can be different.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I seem to almost remember
it's supposed to be different.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Why is it like this?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
This goes even more personally
when we're with people.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
We love somebody.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
We have a friend.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:90%
We have an employee.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And we see the highest in them.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.906 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual people tend to
see the highest in others.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:28.738 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, always.

00:07:28.738 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And when
that person isn't holding

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that vision of themself,
and they disappoint us,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
it's not just they
we're upset with them,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
it's that pain of humanity.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Why can't people rise up?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's a cosmic heartbreak
that I think a lot of seekers

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:90%
are feeling.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.152 align:middle line:84%
And I think for
you when you say,

00:07:48.152 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
stuff happens in
our conversations,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
disappointment, there's that
feeling inside not of grief,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's not just about that
day, it's about the whole deal.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I absolutely know
people can relate to this.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's those things that
knock us off our path-- I mean,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you can go to a great weekend,
or have a great session,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
or be in just a really
fantastic space,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't take much
to knock us off our path.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:90%
But that shouldn't be the case.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: It shouldn't be.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly why
I wrote "Soul Shifts."

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Because transformation
isn't an experience.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a state.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
An experience is, I felt great
for those two hours or that

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:90%
three days at that retreat.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
That's an experience.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
A state means your
consciousness has shifted,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and things may
buffet it, but you're

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
anchored to something
that nothing and no one

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:36.975 align:middle line:90%
can take away from you.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
That's freedom.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a state shift
that's permanent.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's permanent
as we practice it more.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
something and infusing it,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and then it washes
out infusing it.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
it doesn't go away.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's a choice.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the "Soul
Shifts" practices

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that I love the most, it's so
simple, is when we're feeling

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
off, depressed, upset,
angry, irritable,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is to just ask a simple
question: what am I

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:90%
choosing in this moment?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
What am I choosing to do?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing to
blame my husband.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing to be pissed off.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing to feel
sorry for myself.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
To actually, what
I'm choosing, meaning

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%
it's not happening to me.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And then a second
question, what's

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.767 align:middle line:84%
a more enlightened choice
I can make right now?

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I can have compassion
for that person.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not about
your thoughts.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Just the thought, what
am I choosing instantly

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
pulls us out of the
feeling of being a victim.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
What is a more
enlightened choice?

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
The minute we say
enlightened choice,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
our highest in our brain,
literally our brain,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:90%
get activated.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.099 align:middle line:84%
And our file on enlightened
choices opens up.

00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like Google in your brain.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So it says here's 25
million enlightened choices

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:84%
that you already know because
you actually are that being.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
The minute we say it,
we've already shifted.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's unbelievable
how that works.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And people can try
that as a simple thing

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.574 align:middle line:84%
this week, when you're
feeling off at all.

00:10:04.574 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can
just ask yourself,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
what choice am I making here?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: What am I making?

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I'm
not doing anything.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
He's doing it.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I'm choosing
to-- whatever it is,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and to keep asking.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:90%
You can write them down.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then say, is there another,
more enlightened choice?

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And you will shift
in that moment

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:90%
in so many profound ways.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what you talk
about in the book about soul

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:90%
accomplishments?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Is that what little soul
accomplishments are?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
They can happen collectively,
on a little moment

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
to moment basis?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Or big basis?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.155 align:middle line:90%
We could do a lot of them?

00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: To me, one of
the most important parts

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
of the book is about
soul accomplishments.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:90%
All of us have goals every day.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.744 align:middle line:90%
Everyone watching has a goal.

00:10:42.744 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Goals for your relationship.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.826 align:middle line:90%
Goals for your health.

00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Goals of your business.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.943 align:middle line:84%
And your to-do list, and
then your everyday chores

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:90%
you have to do.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the way we evaluate
ourselves on a daily basis

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is, how much did I get done,
or did I achieve a goal?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Did I sign up somebody?

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Did I sell something
to somebody?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Did I whatever it is?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Did I help somebody get in a
good mood who's in my life?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And they're all on the outside.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:90%
We can't control most of those.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So if someone says,
how was your day,

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
we usually look at how
many of the external things

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
went right or wrong, and
we say good day, bad day,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.776 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: To make the
soul shift with this means

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to understand that those
accomplishments will not

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
stick with you.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments is
a phrase I came up with.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's those things where
we are rising to our highest.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
They're the accomplishments
that will really mean something.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:90%
They have value.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.996 align:middle line:84%
They polish our diamond
of our consciousness.

00:11:39.996 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They're the things we take away
with us at the end of our life.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
They're the things
that really become

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
part of our soul, our radiance,
and give us true self-esteem

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and true confidence.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So in the case you
just said, today,

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of beating myself
up about a mistake,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I found a way to
be compassionate.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Today, instead of feeling
really disappointed in somebody,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I allowed myself
to be disappointed

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and to not pull away from them
and shut off, or punish them

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments are
internal, invisible things

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:90%
we do.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.784 align:middle line:84%
It's not, I ate well
today, I went to the gym.

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about inner
shifts, where I basically

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
rose to my highest.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:84%
If you make a list of
soul accomplishments,

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
if you start looking
for them every day,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.949 align:middle line:84%
actually look for
them-- all right today,

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look for my soul
accomplishments in each moment.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I made this choice
instead of this one.

00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Totally shift you.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it shifts the
way you identify.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I call this a shift
in identification

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
from the external mastery
to internal mastery.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are into
management, managing our life,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
managing our thoughts,
managing people, controlling.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And when things don't work
that way, we feel bad.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Mastery is about the inside.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So the shift that I talk
about in one of the chapters

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
is how to shift from
managing everything

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:90%
all the time to mastery.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Mastery, you can control.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the management
causes that overwhelm,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.914 align:middle line:90%
that exhaustion, doesn't it?

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It causes
overwhelming exhaustion

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.407 align:middle line:90%
because it is doomed to fail.

00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It's doomed to fail.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
can we do instead?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Say, for instance,
something goes wrong,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
something gets canceled,
you're disappointed.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.885 align:middle line:90%
You're let down.

00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually start
to use some of the magic

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.169 align:middle line:84%
during that time to
less exhaust yourself?

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Am I asking this the right way?

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So say you get disappointed
about something.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
That there was just a
flat out shut door, no.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you lift yourself
into that place

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the
possibilities in order

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle line:84%
to take the stress
of that moment off?

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: The
stress at that moment

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
comes from our
rigidity of saying,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
this is supposed to
be a certain way.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.357 align:middle line:84%
How do you know-- one of my
favorite things in the book

00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:58.815 align:middle line:84%
is in the beginning
chapters, where

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I talk about what looks like
a wall, and it's a door.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Talk to me about that.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's a
great dream I had.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a powerful dream.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.467 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to ruin it,
because people write me and say

00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:90%
they cried when they read.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's about climbing up, and
thinking that there's a wall,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.585 align:middle line:84%
and you can't climb over it,
and you can't climb over it,

00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly realizing that
it's actually not a wall.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.683 align:middle line:84%
There's a tiny key, and
there's a tiny door.

00:14:19.683 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And so you said the no.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Something slams in your face.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Those things happen,
but they're doorways.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
They're gateways.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not there to tell
us something is wrong.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
They're there to redirect us.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
They're there to teach us
something, show us something.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And what looks like
a no to one thing

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to be yes
to something else.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that life
isn't about that rigidity,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
it's either working or
not, closed or opened,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
having a more expanded
view allows us to say,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
this was disappointing.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't like what happened.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.855 align:middle line:84%
And again, what is the
highest thought about this?

00:15:01.855 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
What is another choice I
could make in this moment?

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Look for the
keyhole, look for the door.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: What is
another choice I can make?

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I call that the third door.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.459 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us are,
it worked or it didn't.

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: That's
not really true.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.819 align:middle line:84%
Now in hindsight, we can,
oh yes, that happened to me,

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and it was bad, but it was the
best thing that ever happened.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.734 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's always
in hindsight.

00:15:20.734 --> 00:15:23.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: We can be
enlightened in hindsight.

00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We're very enlightened looking
backwards onto our life,

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We are.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's how do we
bring that into the moment?

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's what the soul
shifts practices are about.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not about sounding
smart, collecting revelations,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
collecting spiritual
experiences.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It's grounding it, and
making choice after choice.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.425 align:middle line:84%
How do I show up in my
highest under all conditions?

00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take
a look at this video

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
where Barbara's talking
about her superhero.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: My
real life superhero

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
is my first
spiritual teacher who

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I met when I was 18 years old,
and taught me how to meditate.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Taught me about what's inside,
and not just what's outside.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I began my career that I'm
well-known for now in my 30's.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And from the time
I was 18 until 30,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I was in a very deep inner path.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was back in
the 1960s and '70s,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
when these things weren't really
popular like they are now.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So he was my superhero,
because he taught me

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:90%
to go inside deep, deep, deep.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
came out, it would

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
be coming from a place of
power, a place of alignment,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:90%
a place of strength.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I started my
career later on in life,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
it was like an arrow
that was shot and hit,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because I had gone very deep
first, and then very far out.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
That made him a superhero
to me, because he

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:84%
taught me to have the
superpowers of finding

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:90%
the power within myself.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Every day, one of the things
that I do that I've actually

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
written about in my
new book "Soul Shifts"

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is acknowledge and
appreciate what

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I call soul accomplishments.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Each day, usually at the
end of the day, we think,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
what did I get done on my to-do
, list did I make any deals,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
did I make money, did I finish
the phone calls I should make?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And those things are important,
but the real accomplishments

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that stay with us are what
I call soul accomplishments.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments
are invisible.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Did I motivate myself
past my fear today?

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Did I forgive somebody
instead of just

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:90%
being impatient with them?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Did I honor myself for things
I did instead of thinking,

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
but here's five
things I didn't do?

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Soul accomplishments are the
things that will stay with us.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll take them with us
at the end of our life.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They are what carves us and
polishes us as a human being.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually the
only ones that really matter.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
want to offer everybody

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is instead of judging yourself
for what you have or haven't

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
accomplished on the
outside, to make sure also

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.617 align:middle line:84%
to honor your soul
accomplishments every day.

00:18:08.617 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And it could have
just been calling up

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
somebody you know is suffering,
or stopping for a moment

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and being able to feel
grateful for your dog,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
or taking a little extra moment
with one of your children.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Those soul
accomplishments are what

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
will fill you with a kind of a
peace that nothing and no one

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:90%
can ever take away from you.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot about how I
would like to be remembered,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.414 align:middle line:84%
because I've lost a lot
of people close to me

00:18:33.414 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:90%
in the last few years.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
My parents, friends, my
beloved animal companions.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And really, understand
that life is

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:90%
so precarious and so fleeting.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I live every day in
a way that I hope

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I will feel at the end of the
day I've given as much love

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
as possible to
myself, to others,

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I've created upliftment
wherever I go.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I've made a difference
not because, again,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of what I've
achieved, but because

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of how I've showed up
vibrationally as a person.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to be remembered
for my acts of love,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
my acts of compassion, and the
tremendous ability that I've

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:84%
had to be able to bring
out love in others,

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to create love in others,
to create light in others

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
like the way we think
about a sunny day,

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
or the way we think
about a beautiful place.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Something that created
upliftment, which

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:90%
means that we were lifted up.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
My life's been about
lifting people.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be remembered
for lifting everybody up,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
so that they can continue
to lift others up,

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and it passes on,
and on, and on.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
change the world.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us think
about the legacy

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
we're going to leave
at the end of our life.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
What will we have
accomplished, what

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:90%
will people remember us for?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Every day, we leave a legacy.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I invite all
superheroes to do

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
is think, what's the legacy
I want to leave today?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Not at the end of
my life but today.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Did I leave for love?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Did I leave more vision?

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Did I leave more hope?

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
To actually think that
each day is a legacy day,

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and to think about at
the end of that day,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
the imprint you will
have made on the world.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:90%
What will it have been?

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Will it be better because of how
you loved, how you showed up,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:90%
how you communicated?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Everyone of us can change
the world every single day,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
if we realize we are
leaving a legacy,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
whether we realize it or not.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you took a long
time on your spiritual journey,

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
like from a very young
age, when you were 18.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
What inspired you to start
journeying at 18 looking for

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and finding spiritual teachers?

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.595 align:middle line:84%
Most 18-year-olds
are not doing that.

00:20:41.595 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: My
cosmic alarm clock

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
went off, as I talk about in
the beginning in the book.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.433 align:middle line:84%
And there was so many
readers writing me

00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and saying, that's it.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
My cosmic alarm clock just
went off reading this.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic alarm clock,
something inside of us

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly
begins to instill us

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
with the desire to ask what
I call the sacred questions.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people's questions are,
how do I find a boyfriend?

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
How much money?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older, our
questions get more mature.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Seekers have
different questions.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm supposed
to contribute something,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not sure what it is.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.919 align:middle line:84%
Can I still contribute
when I'm not perfect?

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:27.085 align:middle line:84%
See, these are all-- aren't
these the questions that

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:90%
have been in your heart?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Am I a fraud
if I'm teaching something

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe in, and
yet I had a bad day?

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
These are the
questions of seekers.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I had these questions
at a very early age,

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and I think anyone
watching this,

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
your cosmic alarm
clock has gone off.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And most people push the snooze
button and go back to sleep.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you wake up, you
can't go back to sleep.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.737 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
when we wake up,

00:21:54.737 --> 00:21:56.445 align:middle line:84%
if you've been sleeping
or taking an nap,

00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:58.967 align:middle line:84%
or you fell asleep, you go,
oh my god, what time is it?

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember anything.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What day is it?

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: The thing
about being asleep

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.565 align:middle line:90%
is we don't know we're asleep.

00:22:03.565 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The thing about being
unconscious in life

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.797 align:middle line:84%
is we don't know we
were unconscious.

00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't know we
were having patterns.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't know we were
carrying emotional baggage.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We just think we're normal,
until we start to awaken.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
awaken, whether it's

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.625 align:middle line:84%
reading, or coming to
a seminar like mine,

00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or watching your show, all of
a sudden the first thing that

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
happens when we awaken
is we go into shock.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.907 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Out of regret?

00:22:28.907 --> 00:22:30.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Because
we're seeing the things

00:22:30.739 --> 00:22:31.704 align:middle line:90%
we hadn't seen.

00:22:31.704 --> 00:22:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
no one else talks about.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you can't go back.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: People
think, oh, I'm

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.605 align:middle line:84%
gong to start working
on myself, and I'm just

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
going to feel better
every single day.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is when you turn
the light on in a room that's

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.354 align:middle line:84%
been dark, you look and
you see all those things

00:22:45.354 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
noticed that have

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:90%
been stuffed under the bed.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.622 align:middle line:90%
This is a symptom of awakening.

00:22:50.622 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I talk a
lot about in "Soul Shifts,"

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
symptoms of transformation
that most people are thinking

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
are symptoms that
something's wrong with them.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So people stop there.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: They stop, or
they think, I'm just depressed,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
or why am I so impatient
with everything?

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the
divine discomfort.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So for me going back
to your question,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I was really unhappy
early adolescent,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like a
stranger in a strange land.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't relate to anything.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I was asking these questions.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
There was no personal
growth movement.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:90%
There was no GaiamTV.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
There was no
nothing at the time.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:90%
There was psychiatry.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
anyone like me.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading
existential French literature

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and poetry, and trying
to find answers.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I went to my
first week of college,

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a poster at
University of Wisconsin.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.144 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "Learn
to meditate."

00:23:45.144 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
meditation was.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
There was no popular
meditation then.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a picture
of a beautiful Indian man,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
who happened to be
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I saw it, I
went, I don't know what this is,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:90%
but I recognize this.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Something about
this is familiar.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I went to the lecture,
and I started my--

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and that was my
cosmic alarm clock.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I began
the inner journey, I went,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the direction I
was supposed to go in.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I taught meditation and did
very deep spiritual work

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:90%
for years in seclusion.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't start my
career, this career,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.375 align:middle line:90%
until I was 32 years old.

00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me about that.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
ever thought back,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:84%
or I'm sure journeyed back into
a past life through regression,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and realized that you were
alongside those teachers,

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.455 align:middle line:90%
or in that asheron?

00:24:40.455 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Yes.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: I'm
a very old soul.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And I remember a lot.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:52.372 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
us-- because it's not

00:24:52.372 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:90%
so much interesting about me.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of us
remember the emotional energy

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:90%
without the content.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things
I help people a lot with.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Somebody feels, I'd like
to do more for the world,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
but I'm afraid people
will make fun of me.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Where's that coming from?

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Many times it's coming from
having been persecuted,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
having done it wrong,
having made mistakes,

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't trust
ourselves again.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that's in there
that is programming our life

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
and limiting us.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And so we have those collisions.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
One part of us are
saying, go do this,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and the other part's
saying, no, don't do it.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
That collision is important
to investigate, to look at,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to work with the techniques in
"Soul Shifts" and understand,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:90%
something's trying to birth.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's us.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's our purpose.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.876 align:middle line:84%
And it's our assignment
to the world.

00:25:42.876 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:90%
We're here to do something.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- and I
really want to say this,

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.965 align:middle line:84%
because people can look at you,
they can look at me and say,

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
wow, you're making a difference.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.255 align:middle line:90%
I don't know have a show.

00:25:53.255 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't write a book.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Every single person
watching makes

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:90%
a difference every single day.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
a business card that

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.426 align:middle line:90%
says you're a teacher.

00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
We are all making a
vibrational difference,

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:90%
whether we believe it or not.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Every thought, every
way we look at people,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the way we walk
through the world,

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to say
a word, and we're

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
broadcasting energies out.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
difference everybody

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
can make every day is to show
up with the highest vibration

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.060 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, we're
just a walking blessing.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And that means doing
whatever we can

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to clean up our own emotional
and spiritual vibration.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.256 align:middle line:84%
And that itself will
be such a contribution.

00:26:38.256 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And we all know that.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You meet somebody, two
seconds, I don't like them.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:90%
They haven't said a word.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or vice versa.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Or I just want
to be near their energy.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.954 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can think, don't
you want to be the person,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
people say, I want to
be near your energy.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
That means getting
yourself aligned inside,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
so that there's inner harmony,
so that you don't have

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of-- I call it our
emotional asteroid belt,

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of junk that
people have to get through.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
That we are living in an
inner, peaceful planet

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:90%
inside of ourselves.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So people want to come onto our
planet, they want to hire us,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.425 align:middle line:90%
they want to be near us.

00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:90%
As opposed to--

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we can make
conscious choices too,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.148 align:middle line:84%
with the food that we
buy, and the food that we

00:27:18.148 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
put in our bodies, and the
clothes that we choose to wear.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can go
through all of that

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and make a difference in
the world in small ways,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily in--

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.283 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: We can.

00:27:27.283 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But to me, again, I'm
going beyond that.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking really about
the internal shifts.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.046 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, we all
can do things every day

00:27:35.046 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And you smile at someone.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about consciousness.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
How we actually
show up, so that we

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:90%
become a vibrational blessing.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a word in
Sanskrit, darsana.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Darsana means literally sight.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:90%
The divine sight.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It's used how you experience
a great being, like the Dalai

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Lama, a great Indian Saint.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And they say you
have the darsana of.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
It means in the presence
of a high being.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
They have so much light,
such a vibration of peace,

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to
hear them talk even.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You just sit near them.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
People in India will go
for thousands of miles

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to have quote, "the
darsana of the saint,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:90%
or to go just get the blessing.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what they mean.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:84%
All of us are giving people
our darsana in a way.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Every time, we're
either blessing people

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and uplifting them, or
we're creating agitation,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
even if we don't talk.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's like, oh my god, now
I have even more responsibility.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought if I didn't say
anything, no one felt it.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.360 align:middle line:90%
But of course, they do.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking about, how
do we shift our vibration,

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
so that we can literally
vibrate, broadcast out,

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.317 align:middle line:90%
the highest energy all the time.

00:28:48.317 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can just do
that with our frequency?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
We can just do that
with being linked.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.174 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: We
can't just do it.

00:28:53.174 --> 00:28:57.016 align:middle line:90%
A We can't just do it.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
This is what "Soul
Shifts" talks about.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
What creates our
vibrational frequency?

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It thoughts.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Its feelings.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It's old things we
haven't let go of.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's choices we're making.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It's inner battles that
we're having with ourselves.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
When we shift that frequency--
scientists measure this

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:84%
all the time-- then we are
literally broadcasting out.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just
vibrating matter.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Physics tells us this.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
We may look like we're-- I
say we're frozen consciousness

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Popsicles.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Because consciousness,
when it gets more frozen,

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.290 align:middle line:84%
or matter when it gets more
dense, gets slowed down,

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:90%
gets to be something we can see.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:84%
When it's sped up,
it's invisible.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So right now, this is
matter, we just can't see it.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're very dense
consciousness.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Very dense matter
that we say is solid.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.262 align:middle line:84%
So to change, we have to change
at the vibrational level.

00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then,
we can take that,

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.259 align:middle line:84%
and we can emanate it
out into that field?

00:29:57.259 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: We
don't emanate it out.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It emanates out.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're
all vibrating out.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The simplest way to
understand it is what we said.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Somebody walks into a room,
you go, I don't know why,

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:84%
but I just get tense around
them, or I like them,

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:84%
or they seem right,
but I don't trust them.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
They haven't said a word.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But we all really
are broadcasting.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I call it the soundtrack of
our soul in "Soul Shifts."

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.794 align:middle line:84%
Kind of when you watch a movie,
there's the scene that you see,

00:30:23.794 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:90%
then there's the soundtrack.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
watching "Avatar,"

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
or you're watching whatever.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.191 align:middle line:90%
Some movie that's romantic.

00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the actors,
and they're kissing.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But what if the background
music was scary, or angry,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:90%
or cartoons.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
You'd think, they're kissing,
but the music doesn't match.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:90%
The music is vibration.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration says,
this is an emotional moment,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:90%
or this is a scary moment.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Or this is an exciting moment.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We all have the soundtrack
playing vibrationally

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:90%
behind us.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you can
imagine, what's the song?

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So we could be going, oh,
hello, I'm motivational person.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But behind us, we could
have scary music, our fear.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to do it.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Like "Jaws."

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.621 align:middle line:84%
So we're there going, I'm
going to help enlighten you,

00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to eat better.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But behind us,
there's this music.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:90%
People feel it.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Or we could have a message about
the fact that we are loving,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:84%
but behind us, we have very
angry music from energy

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't cleared.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're going,
I love everyone.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
sharpness to it.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:90%
People pick this up.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
you'll go, oh my god,

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:90%
I know people like that.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
That person, I was
impressed when I met them,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.644 align:middle line:90%
because I've heard of them.

00:31:42.644 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But they had a
soundtrack that didn't

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.875 align:middle line:90%
match what they were saying.

00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: We all
have a soundtrack.

00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about what's the
soundtrack of your soul.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
There's some great techniques in
"Soul Shifts" to find that out.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:84%
People go, oh my
god, my soundtrack

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
has been the Apocalypse,
except that I'm there going,

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:90%
everybody should believe in God.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I mean about
vibrational transformation.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.089 align:middle line:84%
I call that our
vibrational heritance?

00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:84%
No one has talked
about these things.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I created them.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: They're
really very practical ways.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: I'm known for
taking-- Deepak Chopra always

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:84%
says, I take the complex
and make it simple.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking these things
that you might think, oh,

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%
these are esoteric.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
They're so basic the
way I explain them.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get
letters from people,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.459 align:middle line:84%
it's their first
transformational book

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:90%
they've read.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.328 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And they said, I
don't like any of this stuff.

00:32:38.328 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:90%
This, that.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:39.980 align:middle line:90%
they.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Totally get it.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Totally get it.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because it's practical.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Yes.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.123 align:middle line:84%
And people who've been
doing this for a long time.

00:32:45.123 --> 00:32:49.885 align:middle line:84%
And they are saying, this is
integrating so much for me.

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:51.032 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So the soundtrack.

00:32:51.032 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to the
vibrational transformation--

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.656 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: I
know you like that.

00:32:54.656 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so true.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with people's
authenticity as well.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So, being authentic
with who you're being.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So say, for example, you
do find that you've got

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the "Jaws" soundtrack going
on, and you're talking

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
about something different.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.247 align:middle line:90%
How do you align the two?

00:33:09.247 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you get those two--

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.746 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You
don't align them.

00:33:11.746 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to shift.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
You can't align them,
because your fear

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.339 align:middle line:84%
and your positive
message are dissonant.

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to be in alignment.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
This is why a lot of people get
nervous speaking, by the way.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as
really fear of speaking.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's that what happens when
we speak is, I'm here saying,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach you today
about drinking green drinks,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have a twin who comes
on the stage with us, who's

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.197 align:middle line:90%
there the entire time.

00:33:41.197 --> 00:33:43.113 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the twin's there
with a little checkbook

00:33:43.113 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and then going, uh-huh,
that sounded stupid.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:90%
No one laughed at that joke.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking, but
we're feeling the judge.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Or our mother's on stage, or
our ex-husband's on stage.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.950 align:middle line:84%
When I teach people
about speaking,

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I teach how many people
are with you in the room

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking, or
when you're doing anything,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
or when you're having
a conversation.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Those are all pieces of us
that need healing and need

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.150 align:middle line:90%
alignment.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are just
the kind of-- I

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.540 align:middle line:84%
mean, they're such great
analogies because you go,

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, it's true.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.269 align:middle line:90%
There's ten of me.

00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:16.989 align:middle line:84%
Or there's five of me
in a job interview.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm on a date, and my every
ex is there with me in bed,

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I
mean about shifting.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
We can't do it by
thinking positively.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about shifting
from positive thinking

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to positive vibrating.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.159 align:middle line:84%
Actually doing the
work, the real work.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Understanding more about
yourself is not transformation.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the beginning.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.546 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the first step.

00:34:42.546 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: It's revelation.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Revelation is not.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
Transformation it would be
like saying, oh my god, water.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
If I want to transform the
water, I have to freeze it,

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I have to vaporize it.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So oh my god, I'm
afraid of everybody.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I know
I'm a divine being.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not transformation.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the work.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.857 align:middle line:90%
It's baking the cake.

00:35:03.857 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
My favorite analogy in the book.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Not collecting the
ingredients and going,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:90%
this will make a cake.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a cake yet.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Baking.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:90%
How do we bake?

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the process of making
these choices in each moment,

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:90%
shifting.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.677 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly,
we are vibrating

00:35:18.677 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:90%
at such a different level.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.065 align:middle line:84%
It takes one second to
shift our vibration.

00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Even right now.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I
was going to ask you.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Everything
in the universe

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
either creates expansion
or contraction.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Every thought, everything we
see, every TV show, everything.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.875 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it goes
back to the choices.

00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:38.425 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: So to say
what contracts me--

00:35:38.425 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
it's worth it just to get
"Soul Shifts" for that chapter.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:90%
What contracts me?

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:90%
What expands me?

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Who contracts me?

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Who expands me?

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:90%
What kinds of choices?

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
noticing not good or bad,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:90%
but is this expansive for me?

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this contracting me, then we
start adjusting in each moment.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing
things that are going

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to expand our energy
and our vibration,

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
contract them, just

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.460 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand
that, reading

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.319 align:middle line:84%
about it through the techniques,
we can shift in a second.

00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if I said
everybody, think

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.770 align:middle line:84%
about someone you love, a
beautiful place in the world,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:84%
notice how your body's
feeling, you're relaxed,

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.370 align:middle line:84%
your breathing settles
down, you're expanding--

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're happy.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Think about
somebody you're frightened of.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Think about something
you haven't done.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel [WHOOSH].

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So everything is having
that effect on us.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:84%
To look at our life
in terms of, am I

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:84%
doing things that are
expanding my energy, creating

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:90%
a shift in my vibration?

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Or am I holding onto things
that are not doing that?

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
before authenticity.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And one of those
phrases that I've come up with

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.734 align:middle line:84%
and I teach people is
vibrational credibility.

00:36:47.734 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
phrases in the.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Book vibrational credibility.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:84%
That what you're saying and
the vibration are matching.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's not behavior.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It's that when somebody's
talking about love,

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:90%
you're feeling love.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:84%
When somebody is
talking about hope,

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:90%
you're not telling their fear.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I say when you show
up, who shows up?

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Not what you're telling people.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Not the words.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Words are wrapping
paper for our vibration.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all they are.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's the vibration
that gets people.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And you know this.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.011 align:middle line:84%
5%, 7% of what we
say, people here.

00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.926 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Like, most people
have glazed over everything

00:37:28.926 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
we've been saying, but they're
getting a vibration, hopefully

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:84%
of hope, of excitement,
of feeling I'm not alone.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Most people work on their
words, their presentation.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't shift
your vibration,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:90%
you can't sustain it.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So vibrational credibility
means that you're not wobbly.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And we see people all the
time in the public eye talking

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.030 align:middle line:90%
about this, standing for this.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.840 align:middle line:84%
They're so wobbly, that
then their life falls apart,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.290 align:middle line:90%
because they're not living it.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not
talking about choices.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
inside, so that you

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.246 align:middle line:84%
are vibrating everything
that you're believing.

00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen overnight?

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.563 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:06.563 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It takes work.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.910 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:08.535 align:middle line:90%
And experience.

00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: But
what we here for,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.640 align:middle line:90%
but to polish that diamond?

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Vibrational credibility
will get you

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:90%
more in life than anything else.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great point.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Because
people will trust you.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll want to invest in you.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not just I say, very
impressive, or she's pretty,

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:90%
or that was a good proposal.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To be true to
who you are, it's--

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: They'll
feel that you are that.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You
can't fake that.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:34.807 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: And you can't
do that at the last minute.

00:38:34.807 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You
can't suddenly go OK--

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you don't have
to prepare for it either.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.803 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You
can't prepare for it.

00:38:38.803 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, OK, I got to
be vibrationally credible.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.694 align:middle line:90%
You have to just be that way.

00:38:44.694 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
good start, though.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You
can being that way,

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but it's not about
how you're acting.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
If you say, I'm going
to be really loving

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:90%
right now, forget it.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It has to be who you are being.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's the
culmination of choice

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:90%
after choice after choice.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Before you know it, you have
shifted into a different way

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.370 align:middle line:90%
of vibrating.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And that soundtrack that
used to be all mish moshy,

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and have strange things going
on, is now the most uplifting,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:90%
positive, , inspiring music.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a soul symphony.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you feel good.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You feel good, and
people want to listen to it.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth
is people are always

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.081 align:middle line:84%
listening to the
sound of our soul.

00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, take a look
at this video here

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.380 align:middle line:84%
where Barbara talks
about waking up.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And yes, we are all alive.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:90%
We are all awake.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: All over
the world right now,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
there are people
sleeping, walking

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.850 align:middle line:90%
through their lives asleep.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
will never wake up.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
came here to this planet

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and don't remember why.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And have spent their
whole lives trying

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to remember, what's
wrong, what is missing,

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing here?

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:84%
All over the world, there
are people suffering,

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:84%
with no hope of understanding
the secret for freedom that's

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:90%
You, my dear ones, are awake.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [CHEERING]

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You, my dear
ones, have chosen to wake up.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:90%
And I honor you for that choice.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And the world honors
you for that choice.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in our waking up,
we are waking up the planet.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:90%
We are waking up hearts.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:90%
We are waking up souls.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Wakefulness, in this moment,
on this sacred mountain,

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:84%
with this ancient
land that we are upon,

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.930 align:middle line:90%
we come together to awaken.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We come together to awaken
fully, not partially.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, fully.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: We come together
to remember why we are here,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:84%
why you are here,
why you have chosen

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to come right now, at
this time, on this earth.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.040 align:middle line:84%
We come together on this
mountain today for love.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.370 align:middle line:90%
For the reminder of this moment.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It is only in this moment
that joy can be found.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Not when you make $10 million.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Not when you find
your soul mate.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Not when your life
looks perfect.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Not when you lose the weight
you think you need to lose.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Not when the things happen that
you think will make you happy.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is not an acquisition.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a skill.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a skill.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:54.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can't right now sitting
on this beautiful mountain

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:58.330 align:middle line:84%
among your loved ones
in this divine reunion

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that we are a part of, if you
can't feel happy right now,

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.410 align:middle line:84%
no matter what else is
going on in your life,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:84%
when you get that stuff, you
will just have more stuff,

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.755 align:middle line:90%
and still be unhappy.

00:42:11.755 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: So
this is the moment.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:24.460 align:middle line:84%
While I transmit to you, while
you sit here with each other,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.840 align:middle line:84%
while you look at the beautiful
clouds, Mother Nature who

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:34.090 align:middle line:84%
has so cooperated with us
to bless us with the most

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:38.804 align:middle line:84%
magnificent display, as if she
dressed up in her best, best,

00:42:38.804 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:84%
best because she knew Seminar of
the Century was coming, to say

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.330 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for bringing
blessings to my mountain.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for bringing
love to the planet.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
bringing remembrance.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
With all of that in
this moment right now,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.520 align:middle line:90%
breathe in happiness.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in happiness.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:90%
You are alive.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.440 align:middle line:90%
You are here.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: You have such a
way of presenting in such--

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:90%
you are your motivation.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You are motivation.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to speak
and motivate people.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Who you're being
is so motivating,

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a great example of what
you're talking about in terms

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:90%
of vibrational credibility.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:84%
When you speak on stage, you
inspire and motivate people.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:90%
You have a gift there.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It comes out.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.790 align:middle line:90%
How do we learn to do this?

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
said you can't learn it.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But in a vibrational context,
how do we become that?

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You know,
you just said to inspire.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the word
contains "in spirit."

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:84%
When we're connected
to our on authenticity

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, whatever it is,
it could be that we're nervous,

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:84%
it could be that were very
emotional about something.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
In that moment,
we're in alignment.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:84%
A better speaker
would be somebody

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:06.130 align:middle line:84%
who's there, and is nervous,
and is talking about what

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
it was like to be
there, as opposed

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to the person who has
practiced it so much,

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's perfectly polished,
but they're not even present.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.856 align:middle line:84%
So when any of us are
connected to spirit--

00:44:16.856 --> 00:44:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not talking
about spirit,

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about spirit-- our
own essence, our own heart,

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.190 align:middle line:84%
we will be authentic
in that moment.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.640 align:middle line:90%
That's why we love children.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Because kids can
be so inarticulate.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They can't even
speak English yet.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But in one minute,
they'll say something,

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much joy in
it, and so much aliveness,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that we just have
to stare at the.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:84%
If there was child
here, no one would

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.440 align:middle line:90%
be listening to either of us.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Right.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.478 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: They'd
be just staring

00:44:45.478 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:90%
at the child going, hey.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they're
still connected to spirit.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: And it's so
beautiful to watch.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.584 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:52.584 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Every
question you've

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
asked me has the same answer.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Connect back inside.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we open up
ourselves to not

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.280 align:middle line:90%
being upset by what's going on?

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Finding that inner anchor.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It's finding that place
inside of us moment by moment.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Really being conscious
of what we're doing,

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
so that we can make the
highest inner choice.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Soul shifts are
invisible, inner shifts

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.400 align:middle line:84%
in attitude or understanding
that no one else can see.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.485 align:middle line:84%
But because they're
shifting us on the inside,

00:45:29.485 --> 00:45:30.860 align:middle line:84%
everything shifts
on the outside.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.984 align:middle line:90%
And again, this is physics.

00:45:31.984 --> 00:45:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You change things at the atomic
level, everything changes

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.870 align:middle line:90%
on the outside.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:90%
So we go to the finest place.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I say our responsibility
as planetary transformers

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is to rebirth ourselves
over and over again.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: It happens.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: To truly say,
I am not done growing.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:84%
That I need to be the most
enlightened, the most awakened

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.670 align:middle line:90%
person I can be.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: What's the difference
between this and wisdom,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Barbara?

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Wisdom
is knowingness.

00:46:07.285 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
information and wisdom

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.451 align:middle line:84%
is something really important
for people to understand.

00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us collect
information about ourselves,

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.480 align:middle line:90%
about life.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's not wisdom.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom comes from an alchemy
of information and experience.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So that you're not
just saying, oh, yes,

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and we're all positive energy.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: You've had experience.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's
coming from knowingness.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Knowingness is a beautiful word.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing something
in the deepest

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:84%
place, where you're not
accessing it actually

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:90%
from here.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
accessing it from here.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of my meditations
that I offer in my website

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is, how to find the
knowingness in your heart.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We just get confused
by our minds.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So, wisdom comes from
constantly coming back

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to your own
knowingness, and having

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:90%
it be a grounded reality.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.925 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: Is that different
than a soul shift?

00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like it is.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's the
result of many soul shifts.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.635 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Oh, OK.

00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: You see,
wisdom isn't an action.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.530 align:middle line:90%
It's an effect.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.489 align:middle line:90%
You can't do wisdom.

00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: But you can't
do soul shift either.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Yes, you can.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.220 align:middle line:90%
In two seconds.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You can make a soul
shift at any moment.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.840 align:middle line:84%
By all the things we
just talked about.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Oh, OK.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.344 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:47:22.344 --> 00:47:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: I do
them on my radio

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
show for people all the
time, in two seconds.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Because they're shifting to the
soul level, the higher level,

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.680 align:middle line:84%
instead of-- as I
said, what choice

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.990 align:middle line:90%
am I making in this moment?

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.840 align:middle line:84%
How do I bring love
to this situation?

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.070 align:middle line:84%
There's so many questions I
ask in all of the soul shifts.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going into something
saying what can I get from you,

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.260 align:middle line:84%
what can I give to you,
they shift our vibration,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.667 align:middle line:84%
so that we're actually like
interacting differently

00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:52.250 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: So take an
example of relationships.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The couple, money is a main
problem in relationships.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They tend to fight
a lot about money.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Well, actually,
in my earlier books--

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.450 align:middle line:84%
the real issue in
relationship is power.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Power struggles.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And the way those power
struggles manifest

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:90%
is money, sex, children, family.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And we fight about those
things, but we're really

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.490 align:middle line:90%
fighting about power struggle.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:84%
About do I feel I'm getting
what I want from you.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel you're getting
what you want from me.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You can fight about who
unloaded the dishwasher

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:90%
the right way or about money.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.342 align:middle line:84%
If you're not acting in
harmony and in oneness,

00:48:41.342 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:90%
you can fight about anything.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.508 align:middle line:84%
You can fight about what
you're fighting about.

00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:46.300 align:middle line:84%
You can fight about
who started the fight.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Then you can fight about
who's continuing the fight.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And we all know that.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.099 align:middle line:84%
But we're never fighting for
the reasons we think we are.

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Good point.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Great point.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.514 align:middle line:84%
And then, how can you do
a soul shift that can help

00:48:56.514 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:90%
you end the power struggle?

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.120 align:middle line:90%


00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: If we're struggling
to feel we're in control,

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:84%
it's because we're
feeling out of control.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
We are never going to get
that by feeling control

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.430 align:middle line:90%
over somebody else.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.507 align:middle line:90%
Again, same answer, inner power.

00:49:15.507 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Inner power.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: People who
need to be always in control

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and have power over others
who are terrified people.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel powerful.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: That's true.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.031 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: People who feel
they need to have approval

00:49:29.031 --> 00:49:30.240 align:middle line:90%
all the time don't have it.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I love when people
are happy with me.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I love when people buy my book.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I love when the book is
doing well like it is now,

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.219 align:middle line:84%
but I don't need it to
know it's a brilliant book.

00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Or to know who you are.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: I don't need it
to feel good about myself.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.390 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's different
from needing it.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I give it to myself
all the time.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are very love
starved from within.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
to actually have

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that dynamic intimate
relationship with ourselves,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:90%
which I also talk a lot about.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It's so important to do that.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're
going to be starved

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.547 align:middle line:84%
looking for emotional
handouts all the time.

00:50:04.547 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: From others.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: From
everybody else.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: What does giving
yourself self love mean?

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
What is giving yourself
love look like?

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It
means, number one,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.530 align:middle line:84%
noticing all the ways we
don't love ourselves first.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:23.555 align:middle line:84%
It means noticing the I'll
love myself when list.

00:50:23.555 --> 00:50:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll love myself when
I'm the perfect weight.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.591 align:middle line:84%
I'll love myself when
I have this much money.

00:50:28.591 --> 00:50:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And then getting harder.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.507 align:middle line:84%
I'll love myself when
my kids are doing well.

00:50:31.507 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll love myself when my
husband's in a good mood.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're completely
out of control,

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.530 align:middle line:84%
because they're things
we can't control.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is loving
ourself conditionally

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
based on what other people do
or what happens is a dead end.

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I love myself because I
know I am a being of light,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do everything
I can to make choices

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.590 align:middle line:90%
from my highest.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So today, I shifted myself
into love over and over again.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I pushed through
whatever it was.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I honored myself for that.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
talk about, is really

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
seeing things not as burdens
in life, but as blessings.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:11.550 align:middle line:84%
How to really turn
the things even

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.180 align:middle line:84%
we see about ourselves
into blessing.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Into soul shifts.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DEANGELIS: Into soul shifts.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: All right.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to take a
look at this next video.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Barbara takes us through
a beautiful visualization

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.160 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:90%
So just sit back, relax.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a nice long process where
you can go into a journey.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.260 align:middle line:84%
There's beautiful visuals
that go along with it.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted you to take
this experience for yourself,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and have a soul shift
from this experience.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: Finding the
knowingness in your heart.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:58.223 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to become very
quiet and close your eyes.

00:51:58.223 --> 00:52:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And imagine as you close your
eyes that you're standing

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.535 align:middle line:90%
in front of an elevator.

00:52:08.535 --> 00:52:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And that elevator can
take you from your head,

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:90%
your mind, down to your heart.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.660 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yourself
right now standing

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:31.620 align:middle line:84%
in front of your forehead,
just pushing a button,

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and imagining your
forehead opening as you

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:43.070 align:middle line:84%
step into it like an elevator,
stepping into your thoughts,

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.590 align:middle line:90%
stepping into your brain.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a panel in front
of you with glowing lights.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.296 align:middle line:84%
All the different floors
of your consciousness.

00:52:57.296 --> 00:53:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom is a beautiful
red, glowing heart light.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.165 align:middle line:84%
Push that light
with your finger.

00:53:08.165 --> 00:53:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Take your finger in
front of you and imagine

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.070 align:middle line:90%
pushing the red heart light.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, feel your
awareness settling down

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:29.530 align:middle line:84%
from your forehead, down
your face, down your throat,

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
down into your chest
where your heart is.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.840 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the elevator stop.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.140 align:middle line:90%
The doors open.

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yourself walking out
into a beautiful space filled

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:90%
with shimmering light.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Filled with shimmering love.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.726 align:middle line:90%


00:53:55.726 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:90%
The heart space.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Walk out into that space
and feel instantly expanded.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself melting into
the space of the heart.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:29.210 align:middle line:84%
In that heart space,
there is knowingness.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Knowingness is not the
same as information.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.025 align:middle line:84%
It is your wisdom,
your knowingness.

00:54:41.025 --> 00:54:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself in
that space of the heart.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.710 align:middle line:84%
You can even place a hand gently
over your heart on your body.

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.382 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
have to understand

00:55:00.382 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:90%
what knowingness means.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.115 align:middle line:90%
Your heart just knows.

00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:08.930 align:middle line:90%


00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Your heart knows
if you're troubled.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Your heart knows when you
are frightened, even if you

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.530 align:middle line:90%
tell yourself it's no big deal.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Your heart knows when you
are longing for something,

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.490 align:middle line:84%
even when you tell yourself
you don't need anything.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Your heart knows
when you need help,

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.520 align:middle line:84%
even when you tell
yourself you're fine.

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And your heart
knows when there is

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
healing going on in
the heart, healing

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:56.640 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be more free,
more powerful, more loving.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.204 align:middle line:84%
Healing is clearing away
the dust and cobwebs

00:56:01.204 --> 00:56:02.120 align:middle line:90%
in your consciousness.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:14.680 align:middle line:84%
In this moment, with your
hand over your heart,

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.710 align:middle line:90%
take a deep breath.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:26.910 align:middle line:90%


00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into the heart space.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Breathe into your
own knowingness.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:41.815 align:middle line:84%
And whisper to yourself,
my heart knows.

00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.000 align:middle line:90%
My heart knows.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.955 align:middle line:84%
Fill up with the
peace that brings you.

00:56:52.955 --> 00:57:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank your heart
for guiding you.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Thank your heart for
allowing its knowingness

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to penetrate your doubts, your
fears, to help light your way.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, heart,
for it's devotion

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.905 align:middle line:90%
to you and your freedom.

00:57:26.905 --> 00:57:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Thank your heart for
not letting you forget

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:36.950 align:middle line:90%
your purpose and your path.

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:41.780 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.504 align:middle line:84%
Again, whisper to
yourself, my heart knows.

00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:49.990 align:middle line:90%
My heart knows.

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Smile, and feel what
joy that brings you.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:03.677 align:middle line:84%
Take a few moments just
to be with the knowingness

00:58:03.677 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Once more, thank your
heart for its knowingness.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:28.110 align:middle line:84%
it is always there to serve
you if you just become still

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.086 align:middle line:90%
and listen.

00:58:29.086 --> 00:58:32.502 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.502 --> 00:58:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Take another big, deep
breath, feeling so much more

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.145 align:middle line:90%
connected to your heart.

00:58:39.145 --> 00:58:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: That was very,
very beautiful and helpful

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.430 align:middle line:84%
for people to be able to watch
that over and over again.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.737 align:middle line:84%
They can watch a replay and
go through that journey.

00:59:08.737 --> 00:59:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Especially to have
that enlightenment.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to thank
you for joining me here

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.804 align:middle line:90%
in Denver, Colorado.

00:59:13.804 --> 00:59:15.220 align:middle line:84%
We're at the Hay
House Conference,

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and you're speaking tomorrow.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going to be
soul shifting experience.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Barbara.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.949 align:middle line:84%
>>DEANGELIS: It's always
soul shifting being with you.

00:59:25.949 --> 00:59:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And I hope people have had
shifts even just sitting here,

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and that they honor
them, and realize

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.700 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing missing.

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.366 align:middle line:84%
They have everything
they need inside already.

00:59:35.366 --> 00:59:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: That's great.

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:37.910 align:middle line:90%
