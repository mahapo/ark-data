00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations," coming

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.430 align:middle line:10%
to you from our
beautiful studios

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
here in Los Angeles, California.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that 55
million people a day

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
deal with the loss of a
loved one and, on average,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:10%
people can suffer over six
to eight years over grief?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Would it help you if you knew
that although grieving is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
inevitable, there's a
handbook, so to speak,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with
grief in 30 minutes?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So when that debilitating
grief surfaces,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
there is actually a
step-by-step process

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that can help you
handle the next moment

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:90%
with a little bit more peace.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're grieving
the loss of a job

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
or a divorce or
any other loss, it

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
helps if you have a grief
coach-- or better yet, you

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:90%
become your own grief coach.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is Aurora Winter,
whose firsthand experience

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:84%
with grief taught her how
to help others find a sense

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of peace within the loss.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Great to be here
with you, Lisa.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You're so brave,
and you're such an inspiration

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to so many people.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So tell me
about your experience

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
when you suddenly had to handle
an enormous amount of grief.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.846 align:middle line:10%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, well,
my story is that, you know,

00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:10%
I thought my life was perfect.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And it was just on the cusp
of getting even better.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:10%
My husband and I had
launched a multimillion

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:10%
dollar business from scratch.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.876 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Oh my goodness.

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:10%
We had a beautiful
four-year-old son,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:10%
who was adorable as only
four-year-olds can be.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We were building our
dream home on the lake.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd just met Mel
Gibson and Goldie Hawn

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and John Badham, who
directed "Stakeout."

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm, like, yeah.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm being paved and hired to--

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh my gosh.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:90%
---to write a screenplay.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, yeah,
everything's perfect

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and just about to get better.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then my 33-year-old
husband died suddenly.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.221 align:middle line:84%
And he died, you
know, right beside me.

00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And--
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It was devastating.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt like my entire
life shattered.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I felt like Humpty Dumpty,
you know, smashed to pieces.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea how to put
the pieces back together again.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: When you
were on such a high

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and then this-- out
of the blue-- I mean,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when you're
on that kind of a role,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, nothing bad is
going to happen to me, right?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm super-person, right?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how I felt. I felt
like I was in a golden glow.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I tried everything
to get better, you know.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I worked out as if I was
training for the Olympics.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I read every self-help book
I could get my hands on.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:90%
You know, I did therapy.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I went to church, but
nothing really helped

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
until I put together a recipe.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
First, I stumbled
across it for myself--

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:90%
put it into use in my own life.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.761 align:middle line:84%
And now, that just
changed everything.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy.
I'm peaceful and effective.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, I mean, let
me take you back to that moment

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.956 align:middle line:90%
when you were dealing with that.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you had--
I mean, were you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
dealing more with your own
grief or the grief of your son

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that he was-- that your son
was going through or both?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you have
time to grieve yourself?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's almost
like asking, like,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
did you have time to
deal with the tidal wave?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
No, you don't have-- you
know, but you have no choice.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I-- it was so intense for me.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It was so unexpected.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was so in love
with my husband.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was just hit
with a tidal wave of emotions.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was so raw.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
raped emotionally.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It was horrific
and heartwrenching.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I wanted
to be there for my son.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was not at my best--
LISA GARR: Right.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.191 align:middle line:90%
---to say the least, yeah.

00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And the questions
that he was asking-- I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
mean, when I read your book,
"From Heartbreak to Happiness,"

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I read it in one night.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was in tears the entire
time because of-- oh, you

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
write-- first of all
the journaling process

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that you did that helped you
get through these moments--

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
these step-by-step moments.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
How did you get yourself
to be able to even write?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.751 align:middle line:84%
Some days, it was
just one sentence.

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:53.149 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, I've written
a diary since I was nine,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't a new
thing that I took on.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a habit.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And thank God, I had
that because that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:90%
was really my lifeline.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if-- if you can't
feel it, you can't heal it,

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I've since learned.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And journaling actually
is a simple thing

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
people can do that
will really help them

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
discover their own
wisdom and exorcise

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.120 align:middle line:90%
those demons, so to speak.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, as you
read in my book,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:84%
one of the toughest
moments was telling my son

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:90%
because he was only four.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.386 align:middle line:84%
And he kept asking, you know,
when is Daddy coming home?

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, aren't
the doctors going

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:90%
to make Daddy's heart better?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't spit
out the word dead at first.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Not that
he would comprehend.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.623 align:middle line:84%
No, not that a
four-year-old understands--

00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah.
---dead.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So I told him again and again
Daddy's not coming home.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that day-- you know,
the 24 hours after my husband

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
died-- that actually the
death was horrific but telling

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
my beautiful four-year-old,
with so much hope in his eyes,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that Daddy wasn't
coming home, that was

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
like, ugh-- knife in my heart.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So how did
you go through even

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
healing that process-- and
take him along with you?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: It was a journey.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.235 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes, it
didn't happen overnight.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.405 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: It
didn't happen overnight.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And that's
important, right there,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:90%
for people to understand.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It is a process.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: It is a process.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Healing is a process.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Edward [INAUDIBLE] has
done extensive research.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you said in the
opening, people can typically

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
suffer five to eight years.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And my life's work now is
to change that because I

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
think it takes five to
eight years because we

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
don't know any better.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not people's fault.
They don't have a recipe.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a system,
and they just wait.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But just as if you
had a broken arm,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make sense
with a broken arm

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to ask, well, how
long should I wait

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
before going to see the doctor?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But people ask that
with a broken heart--

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
like, how long should I
wait before doing anything?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait!

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Do something now.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Don't,
like- do what though?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, OK.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I mean,
grieving groups,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%
processes, things like that?

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, well,
you know, I have a process.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.147 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into that in depth.

00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to share that
because it's something

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:90%
people can immediately do.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: There
was a moment that I

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
read about that
you had that was--

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
it was a dream, wasn't it?
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
A moment of acceptance, which--
how long after your husband

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
passed did you have
that-- that dream?

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I had
a life-changing dream

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
on the second
anniversary of his death.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And up until that moment,
I still felt like a victim.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I shouldn't
be a single mom.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't, you
know, be a widow-- uh,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:90%
horrible word to even get out.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And our son shouldn't
be without his father.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so my late husband
came to me in this dream,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and he asked me three questions,
and they changed my life.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The first question was, if you
had it to do all over again,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:90%
would you still marry me?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.219 align:middle line:84%
I thought about
all the good times,

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, I'd still marry you.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
The second question was--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
powerful right there.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.635 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I'm
fighting back tears.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.499 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: I can see that.

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But I
mean, for you to even

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
get to that point of would you
go through this all over again?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And that you loved him that
much that you would go through

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.662 align:middle line:84%
that all over again is huge.
Yeah.

00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And, OK, you got me.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was wonderful to get
those questions in the dream.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The second question was, if you
had it to do all over again,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
would you still have our son?
LISA GARR: Oh.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like, of course,
he's the light of my life.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:90%
He's my joy-- my blessing.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade
him for anything.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: No.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And the third question
really changed my life

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
because he said, well,
given those two answers,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
would you want to know
that I would die young?

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I searched my heart in the
dream for a very long moment.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
the answer was no.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I would not want
to taint the joy

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.157 align:middle line:90%
that we did have with dread.

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That makes sense.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every moment
you would be--

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Dreading it.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Hm mm.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.893 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: And that
changed everything.

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed
that victim energy

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to just evaporate and be
replaced with gratitude

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:90%
for the time that we did have.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And for those first
two years, you know,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:90%
grief is not one emotion.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.196 align:middle line:84%
It's a cacophony of emotions.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:01.095 align:middle line:84%
And you read in my book,
"From Heartbreak to Happiness."

00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:01.794 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But I did in general have a
lot of victim energy around it.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But after that dream, that
sense of being a victim

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.385 align:middle line:90%
permanently evaporated.

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Well, I want
to expand on those two

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:10%
years for a second because you
do an amazing job of putting

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:10%
words to those feelings
that people are having about

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:10%
their joy being taken away--
about the victimization of it

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be this way--
of are they in pain--

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.417 align:middle line:10%
all of that, any kind of loss.
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: As I
mentioned earlier,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
it could be the loss of a job.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.501 align:middle line:84%
It could be explaining the
loss of a pet to a little one.

00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.
LISA GARR: Yeah, all right, so--

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well, I really
define grief as the loss

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:90%
of hopes and dreams.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't have to be death.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.971 align:middle line:84%
You know, a divorce
has got grief--

00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
---because of the loss
of hopes and dreams.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.859 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
If you lose or change
careers, there can be grief.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Financial loss grief--
having a special needs child

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
with autism, I also define
that as the loss of hopes

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.714 align:middle line:90%
and dreams, so there's grief.

00:08:56.714 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I define grief very,
very broadly because it's

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:90%
not what happens exactly.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It's what did you
expect to happen?

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:90%
What were your hopes and dreams?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you just
allow your dreams

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to be stillborn without honoring
that and processing that

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
somehow, it's going
to weigh on you--

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
whereas if you acknowledge
that, then you can grieve it.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there opens
a space for new dreams

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%
and new possibilities.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.476 align:middle line:84%
But coming back
to your question--

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:24.576 align:middle line:84%
or did you want
to say something?

00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:25.842 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah,
well, it was actually

00:09:25.842 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that-- what you just said about
having a child with autism.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I heard somebody
from your-- that

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:84%
had been through your
workshops and your process

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
explain that was her experience
of when she found out

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
her child had autism,
that she really

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.221 align:middle line:84%
felt like she was robbed from
having a normal child, right?

00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.
LISA GARR: That experience.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
She had a life-changing
"aha" at one of my Grief

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Coach Academy workshops.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And she went from thinking
that her special needs daughter

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
was driving her
insane to realizing

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that she was driving her sane.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was really calling
her forth into her greatness,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
into being grounded,
into being peaceful,

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
into being the best
human being and mother

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:90%
she could possibly be.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's shifted from
feeling like this shouldn't be

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
happening to me, like--
to feeling like gratitude

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.405 align:middle line:90%
and it changed her life.

00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:16.804 align:middle line:84%
So in a moment,
[SNAPS]

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:90%
---we can change our thinking.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's our thinking that
keeps us stuck in grief.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Do you think we have
to go through a two-year period

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
before we get there?
AURORA WINTER: No!

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.926 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: No?

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: No.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.687 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I mean, 30
minutes, Aurora-- really?

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Really.
-Really.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.683 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Really.

00:10:31.683 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And here's-- when
I coach people,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
they can sometimes have
a meaningful but welcome

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:90%
shift in 30 minutes.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they have
a life-changing shift

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in 30 minutes or less.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And just like you
can get totally clean

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and have a luxurious
shower in 30 minutes,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that
you only do it once.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you're not
going to get dirty again.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Right.
LISA GARR: Exactly.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: So
the same with grief.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're really in
the midst of something,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
do the peace method
every day for 30 minutes

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
until you get peaceful--
until you feel grounded.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
can do at home.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do it as a
journaling process.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really in
the depths of despair,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
it's going to work
better if you come

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to a workshop or work with
a certified grief coach,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But 30 minutes a day
will change your life.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's great.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be teaching
that in just a little bit.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But so if somebody
would start off though

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
after they're fresh after
having somebody leave

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
their lives that they love
or a situation or a job,

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.237 align:middle line:84%
would you recommend starting
with the journaling process?

00:11:31.237 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I would recommend
starting with the journaling

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
process and really
allowing all-- just to vent

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
those feelings because I
think unexpressed feelings are

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%
like food poisoning.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.131 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep the
food poison inside

00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
stuff it-- because you

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
know it's going to be a
little bit messy, it's toxic.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:90%
So journaling is easy.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
It's cheap-- all you need is
a pen and a piece of paper.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
discover a lot.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and I got
so much of my energy

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.557 align:middle line:84%
out by writing it down--
and later became the book,

00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
"From Heartbreak to Happiness."

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But I never intended
even to reread it myself

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:90%
when I was writing it.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Some
people don't know

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the scale-- the
level that they're

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:90%
at in terms of grieving.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And you've basically
put that together

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a grief wheel to
show people kind of to wake

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.531 align:middle line:84%
up to where they are on
the grieving scale, right?

00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yes.
LISA GARR: It's a great idea.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:10%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah,
the grief relief wheel

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:10%
is a wonderful thing so
that you can see at a glance

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:10%
where your life is off
balance, and you can

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:10%
see what you can do about it.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:10%
So just like you want a wheel in
your car to be nice and round,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:10%
you want your life to
be nice and rounded.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And people who are in grief tend
to-- even more than normal--

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
go to their strong suits
and ignore their weak suits.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So they can get very lopsided.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And so it just encourages you.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's something very simple
that people can do on their own

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
or they can do with a coach
and help them see what to do--

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:90%
what specific action to take.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: We're going to take
a look at a video that explains

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.767 align:middle line:90%
the grief wheel a little bit.

00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can explain a
little bit more after that.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:10%
So what is the Grief Wheel?

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:10%
Here's what it looks like.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:10%
It's just a circle, and it shows
you-- it's a self-rating thing.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:10%
You can do this
every day, and you

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:10%
look at how do you rate
yourself on a scale of 1 to 10

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:10%
in these various areas?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:10%
So let me just talk
you through it.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:10%
So there's no wrong or right.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of clarity.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this
Grief Wheel every day,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
you'll rate yourself
on a scale of 1 to 10

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
on Acceptance and Forgiveness,
on Self-expression,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
on Spiritual Connection, on
Support Systems, on Self Care,

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
on Finance and Legal, on
Career and Profession,

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
on Family and Parenting,
on Physical Activity,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and on Maintaining
Daily Routine.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just a snapshot in time.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So it can change
from day to day.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And also the good thing
is, as you take activities

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and you do this every
day for the next 30 days,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
you gradually take
small steps to increase

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the numbers that are low.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that your wheel
changes very dramatically.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And your peace, your
productivity, your ability

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
challenge also changes

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
and increases dramatically.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at an example.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:10%
This is for a mother
who's got a special needs

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:10%
child with autism.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:10%
She's dealing with
that diagnosis.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:10%
This is something new for her,
and this is what her Grief

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:10%
Wheel might look like.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is something
she'd do every day for 30 days,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
so it would change over time.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Here's what it looks like.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:10%
And as you can see if this
was a wheel on your car,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:10%
your car would not
be running smoothly.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the same way when this
is a wheel on your life,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
your life is not
running so smoothly.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's see how she could use
the Grief Wheel to get her life

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
in greater balance
and get everything

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
running much more smoothly.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:10%
So she's given the
self-assessment,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:10%
and this again is just
a snapshot in time

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:10%
how she is doing today.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow could be different.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
A month from now
will be different

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:90%
if she does this every day.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:10%
So she's given herself an 8 on
Acceptance and Forgiveness, a 3

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.875 align:middle line:10%
on Self-expression, a 9 on
Spiritual Connection, a 2

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:10%
on Support Systems, a 5 on Self
Care, a 7 on Finance and Legal,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:10%
a 5 on Career and Profession, a
5 on Family and Parenting, a 9

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:10%
on physical activity-- she's
a marathon runner so she's

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:10%
getting a lot of
activity there-- and a 7

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:10%
on Maintaining a Daily Routine.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So when she looks at this
Grief Wheel, what stands out?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, what stands out, of course,
is the low score of only a 2

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
on Support Systems and only
a 3 on Self-expression.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:90%
So what would plus 2 look like?

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.705 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
look necessarily

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
at what a 10 in
Support Systems would

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
be like, but just go
for an easy peasy step

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:90%
that she can do today.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:10%
So to go from a 2 in
Support Systems to a 4

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:10%
on Support Systems for her
could look like that today,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:10%
she'll just make a plan for
what the perfect Support System

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:10%
scenario might look like.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:10%
She might not actually even need
to take any action on it today.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:10%
Maybe she'll do that tomorrow.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:10%
But today, she could feel
like a 4 in Support Systems

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:10%
as she gets more clear where
she could hire more support

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:10%
or ask for more support.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever crisis, heartbreak,
or stress you are dealing with,

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
this tool will be very
helpful for you to get

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:90%
your life back in balance.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, if you use this
every day for the next 30 days,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
it will change your life and
increase your sense of peace,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:90%
productivity, and clarity.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Great, great tool.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
this a little bit.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically like
taking a self-assessment, like

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:90%
being your own grief coach--

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Like being your
own grief coach-- exactly.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
---to see where you're at on the
scale every single day in these

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
various different segments.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, and
it's nice to give yourself,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, thumbs up-- you know,
we're doing 8 on something.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:10%
But also just don't try to
stretch from a 2 or 3 to a 10,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:10%
but just do something easy
peasy and make it manageable.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.204 align:middle line:10%
And then just check it
every day for 30 days

00:17:07.204 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:10%
and just be gentle
with yourself.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:10%
Be kind to yourself is very key
when you're dealing with grief.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And yet if you take a little bit
of action every day, gradually

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:10%
you'll get those lower
numbers much higher.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the first 100
days of my husband's death,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.981 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was
really shattered--

00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
---using the British
sense of the word.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:90%
I was really in deep grief.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, I finally went to
see a coach or a therapist

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
because I just
couldn't handle it.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Every night when I fell
asleep, I would again and again

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
see him dying in front of me.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.077 align:middle line:90%
And I lost 15 pounds.

00:17:41.077 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's shocking.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.309 align:middle line:84%
I was haggard.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Hm mm.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I mean,
post traumatic stress.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Absolutely.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: So they, uh--
my acceptance was not-- was,

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:90%
you know, 2.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The therapist said-- I said you
have to make these dreams stop.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I cannot deal with
these nightmares.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I couldn't sleep.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I was haggard.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I was a mom.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I needed to get my act together.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.401 align:middle line:84%
And the coach said to me,
well, tell me a little bit more

00:18:06.401 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
about your life.
I'm like, I just want results.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to cry.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.822 align:middle line:84%
Just make the
dreams stop, please.

00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.676 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
you know, tell me

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:14.800 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about your life.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, my husband
died a few months ago.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
How are you getting
through the day?

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I just pretend
he's away on a business trip.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I get
through the day OK.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, so you
get through the day

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
by pretending that he's
away on a business trip?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah,
what's it to you?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
She's like, well,
maybe the dreams--

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe the nightmares
aren't the problem.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're the solution
because they're calling you

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
to accept what is the reality.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
He's not away on
a business trip.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, he's dead.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.425 align:middle line:84%
So that one coaching
session shifted me from a 2

00:18:50.425 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
on Acceptance to,
you know, an 8.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So it can happen quite
quickly but just to notice

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:90%
where you are.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It might be something you need
somebody to coach you through.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Or with the example that
we just had on that video,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
it could be as simple
as taking some action

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:90%
to get more support system.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So small things
that you can do can

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
really make a big
difference in getting

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:90%
your life back in balance.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that these
are steps that you--

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that just one by
one, sometimes you

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:90%
go eight rungs up the ladder.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you drop back three.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's a process.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
tangible things

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
you have to deal
with, for example,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
finances and the paperwork
and the details and so

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
forth of-- yeah, it gets to
be-- I mean, not only are you

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a huge
amount of emotions

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:90%
but you have all of that stuff.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER:
This is where it's

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
so helpful not to do it alone.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:10%
I think kindness is key.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:10%
And the second thing
people need is connection.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:10%
So connection, too, might be
a finance, legal, bookkeeper,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:10%
might be a coach,
might be a friend,

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:10%
might be a spiritual advisor--
whatever is the weak link.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it's interesting
that you say that.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I studied
honors economics.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I come from a family of PhDs.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I wrote and designed
a tax shelter.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But after my husband died,
I could not pay the bills.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand it.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when you
have a really big trauma,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.391 align:middle line:84%
the dominant side of
your brain can switch.

00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So I want the-- your audience
to know you're not going crazy.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not Alzheimer's.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:90%
This is temporary.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But one of the symptoms of
major trauma or deep grief

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
can be like you feel
like you're stupid.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not stupid.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.296 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.083 align:middle line:90%
You're just grieving.

00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:33.482 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Hm mm.
Absolutely.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it common to dive into a
routine or of physicality--

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
like, I noticed
that you mentioned

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
you went into working--
I have a friend

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
who also is dealing with a very,
very rapid loss of her husband.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And she is in the gym
three to four hours a day,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.461 align:middle line:84%
just because it's something
that she can handle.

00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.
-Is that common?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I think
it's common that whatever

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
is a strong thing for you--
that was working for you

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:90%
before that you redouble that.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was
already writing before.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a release for me before.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I-- it was my
lifeline after he died.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I was already exercising before.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I redoubled that.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But where coaching
can come in handy

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
is that can make your life
even more lopsided sometimes

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
if you don't also
look at how are

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.729 align:middle line:84%
we going to get the bills paid?
LISA GARR: Right.

00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Simple, practical things.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really invite people,
especially the first three,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:90%
four months, be gentle with you.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you're doing, it's OK.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.315 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Is it OK if you
sit and stare at walls?

00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:35.117 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.117 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: You might
not want to stare at walls.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.215 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really good to
get outside, in the sunshine,

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
get some vitamin D, walk,
move, breathe, sleep.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I drank
after my husband died.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And I've never been a drinker.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It was only one beer a night.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it seemed
like I'm alcoholic.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
OK-- whatever you need.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But after, say,
maybe six months,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:84%
you really need to start
saying yes to life.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And-- and you can
use these processes

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
as a way to say yes to
life or work with a coach

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is for you.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.062 align:middle line:84%
Don't stay hanging out
too long in the dark

00:22:09.062 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:90%
looking at the wall.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, it's great to
know that there's organizations

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:90%
like yours that are out there.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
Grief Coach Academy.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
How did you start it?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
How long after your husband
passed did you start that?

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER:
Oh, it was quite--

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
my husband died a long time
ago now-- 20 years ago.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I started the Grief
Coach Academy in 2006.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's like Oprah
says, sometimes you

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
choose your career, and
sometimes it chooses you.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really honored
and privileged to be

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a catalyst for changing how
people think about grief

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and get through it.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But I was a film and
television executive producer.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite
happily doing that.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But then "From
Heartbreak to Happiness"

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
was published and endorsed
by my hero, Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, that's
my gift to grieving people.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to
being a film and television

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:90%
executive producer.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But the book brought
grieving people to me.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And so first, I just, you
know, had coffee with them

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and helped them out.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I got to
the point where, like, hm,

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to, uh,
either turn people away or--

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Take a look at this.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
---or start charging because
this is time consuming.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was stunned to find
that if I-- when I set it up

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
as a business and started
charging as a coach, more

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:90%
people came to me.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they wanted to know they
could talk to me every week.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they-- and they didn't want
to impose on my good nature.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And then my clients
said, wow, you've

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
helped me more in one
session than my therapist

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:90%
helped me in two years.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Can you teach me?

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, why not?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:10%
So fast forward to today,
we now have a school

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:10%
devoted to giving coaches the
skills they need to help people

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:10%
release grief, transcend
grief, and become happy

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:10%
again much, much more quickly.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And each coaching session
is 30 minutes or less.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's such
an incredible story

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that you have of how you
turned a tragedy into something

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that is so purposeful
and so aligned

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:90%
with helping other people.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And just as the
woman that you know

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that had to suffer the loss
of her child to create MADD,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's these different
experiences-- that I look

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
at people like you and
go, oh my god, I mean,

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:90%
this is your purpose.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:90%
This is your destiny.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well,
it's really a choice.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when something
devastating happens,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:84%
you can become bitter or you
can decide to become better.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel now--
I truly feel in my heart

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that before I was born--
before I was born,

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:90%
God asked for a volunteer.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And He said, can I
have a volunteer?

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Who'd like to teach
people how to go

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.056 align:middle line:90%
from heartbreak to happiness?

00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, hey,
pick me-- pick me.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a
cool life mission.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he asked
for a volunteer

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
who'd be willing to teach
me what I needed to know.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.545 align:middle line:90%
And my late husband volunteered.

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So with that point of view,
there's nothing but gratitude.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.475 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You really
can embrace that.

00:24:47.475 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
You really can.
AURORA WINTER: I do.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that before, and I
have never really actually seen

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:90%
somebody fully embrace that.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to talk to
you about this because you

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
really have embraced that.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.514 align:middle line:84%
That is your path before you got
here, and it's your path now.

00:25:04.514 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I
think there really

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:90%
must be a reason in suffering.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, initially,
when I was suffering,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought God was cruel or
I must be a terrible person

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:90%
to deserve this suffering.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Hm mm.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.285 align:middle line:84%
But I now believe that there
must be meaning in that.

00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, my background
is as a screenwriter.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So what is the difference
between a tragedy

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and a really great drama?

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It's that the hero faces
obstacles in both cases,

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's what the
hero decides to do.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So I-- I'd love to invite
everybody in the audience,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, choose that your
life is a hero's journey.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
How can you respond
heroically to whatever

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:90%
your challenges are?

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
beautifully put.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.053 align:middle line:84%
That's beautifully
put, especially

00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:45.397 align:middle line:90%
from one with experience.

00:25:45.397 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.264 align:middle line:84%
going to teach a little
bit of the Peace Method.

00:25:48.264 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take a quick break.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
Aurora is going

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to take us through
the process that she

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
teaches of grief in 30 minutes.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It is possible.
AURORA WINTER: It is.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn a little
bit about it when we come back.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take a quick break.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back with
Aurora Winter.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: What if there was an
online channel where you could

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
find thousands of videos devoted
to really changing your world?

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
What if this channel
offered programming that

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
cared about the things
that mattered most

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to you-- your well-being,
your community, and the world

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:90%
beyond.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Most people really are
thinking the same way every day,

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.570 align:middle line:10%
acting the same way, and
feeling the same way,

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:10%
but really hoping
something will show up

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.237 align:middle line:10%
differently in their
life, and it never does.

00:26:33.237 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: And
what if it was also

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.490 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to yoga,
fitness, and alternative

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:90%
approaches to health.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:10%
You don't focus on
what holds you back.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:10%
You focus on what's
already there.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: History
and spirituality.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Ego is the belief that
you are separated from God,

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
terrifying thought

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%
that could ever happen to us.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: What if it
offered solutions to many

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:90%
of the problems we face today.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that there
is something I don't fully

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:10%
understand about life--
the understanding of which

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:10%
would change everything?

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: What if it went
that extra mile to help

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.040 align:middle line:90%
you find passion and purpose?

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing what you're
supposed to do, doors open.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: What if this
channel didn't have any ads

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and instead used its
valuable airtime to engage?

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE VOICE: You
will accomplish

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:90%
so much more if you're happy.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
VOICEOVER: Entertained
and enlightened.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:10%
We are spiritual beings
immersed in a human experience.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:10%
VOICEOVER: With many of the
top thinkers and visionaries

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:10%
from around the world.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
MALE VOICE: We started
this film by asking

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with the world.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up discovering
what's right with it.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:90%
VOICEOVER: Well, guess what?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:10%
Inspirational films, original
interviews, engaging series.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to GaiamTV.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of streaming videos
to fuel your life's journey.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And my guest is grief coach
Aurora Winter, author of "Grief

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:10%
Relief in 30 Minutes."

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And there is a method
that Aurora teaches

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:90%
called the Peace Method.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically for
anyone who's experiencing

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:90%
any type of loss, right?

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Exactly.
-OK.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:10%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, I'm so
excited about this process

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:10%
because after "From Heartbreak
to Happiness" was published,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:10%
people were like, wow, I
really connect to your story,

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:10%
but how can I get through
this more quickly?

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:10%
So we have many tools at
the Grief Coach Academy.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But if I had to
pick just one, it

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
would be the Peace
Method-- the fastest

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
way to cut through grief
and get to happiness again.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Peace Method
is really easy to use.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:90%
You can-- I'll explain it here.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And people can do it
as a journaling process

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:90%
immediately and do it every day.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.601 align:middle line:84%
They'll feel much
better very quickly.

00:28:52.601 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- the P stands for
be in the present moment.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So first, you identify
whatever emotion is going on.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion is
linked to a thought.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So catch like a-- like
a Sherlock Holmes,

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
catch the thought that's
linked to that upset feeling.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then one thought at
a time, you'll take it

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:90%
through the Peace Method.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So a painful thought
is like a brick.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's imprisoning you.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
You're imprisoned
in a brick prison.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you just try to take the
whole prison wall down at once,

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to
get a sore shoulder.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus on one brick at
a time and work on the mortar,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
you may get it to
loosen or even pop out.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.861 align:middle line:84%
And then you will focus
on another painful thought

00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and another.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the good news
is-- just like escaping

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
a prison-- you don't have
to take down every brick.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
You just need a big enough
hole to escape into the garden

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Peace Method is a really
powerful way of focusing on--

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give an example
here of one thought at a time.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.694 align:middle line:84%
So may I explain
what it stands for?

00:29:51.694 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah, because
I'm thinking-- I mean,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.493 align:middle line:84%
that's the first
thing I was thinking

00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:84%
is that someone's present moment
might be just too painful.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing when
you do this-- and I've

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:90%
coached many people through it.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And it usually
takes me 15 minutes.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
So 30 minutes is ample time.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do is
identify the painful thought.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So in my example, it might be
my husband's death is the worst

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:10%
So the P is come into
the present moment.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:10%
The E is express your feelings.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:10%
The A is look to accept or even
can you appreciate something?

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:10%
The C is consider the contrary.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:10%
And the E is to find
something that you

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:10%
can be enthusiastic
about being or doing.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.491 align:middle line:10%
So let's use an example
and walk it through.

00:30:34.491 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: So
I'm self-coaching--

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:90%
imagining I was journaling.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So I feel upset and I write,
my husband's death is the worst

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:90%
So P of the peace method.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
and another one.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And just literally
come into your body--

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
come into the present moment.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And then ask is that painful
thought-- my husband's death is

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:84%
the worst thing
that ever happened

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to me-- is that about the past,
the present, or the future?

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's about the past.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can never
change the past.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We can only forgive,
make amends, let it go,

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:90%
heal, transcend.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But we can never
change the past.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And if it had been
about the future,

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.231 align:middle line:84%
we can never solve all
potential future problems.

00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Hm.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We can-- we can deal with the
one problem slash opportunity

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that's right here-- right now.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So already that first
step brings clarity.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What if in
that moment of pain,

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
you're still-- what is present
is a child who is grieving

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
or a bill that's not being paid.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So that moment is painful
in that very moment.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: That's OK.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Then what you do is you--
rather than pushing away--

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be feeling sad.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be feeling pain.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
You welcome it and just notice
where it is in your body.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Notice other painful thoughts.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But you need to focus
on one brick at a time.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
If you just do a
little bit on all,

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.360 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to go right.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an unpaid bill,
what is the painful thought?

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Is the painful thought I
don't have enough time?

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Or is the painful thought
I don't have enough money?

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Or is the painful
thought my husband

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.321 align:middle line:84%
used to take care of the bills?
LISA GARR: Right.

00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Or he's not here.
-Don't do 49 at once.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.280 align:middle line:84%
See which of those
thoughts is the most

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
sticky, icky, upsetting--
and then follow that one

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:90%
all the way through.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And then if you want
to do another one,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:84%
follow another one
all the way through.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.159 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So would you like
me to continue giving

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:90%
the example around my husband?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Or did you want to
change it to a bill?

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.440 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: No, no, that's-- I
mean, you answered my question.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.006 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
AURORA WINTER: All right.

00:32:36.006 --> 00:32:37.610 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Because I'm just--
I'm just imagining this

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.510 align:middle line:90%
as you're going through it.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: But the next
step of the Peace Method

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.450 align:middle line:84%
does give you more
opportunity to express

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts and feelings.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So using the example
of my husband's death

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is the worst thing that
ever happened to me,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I came into the present moment.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.839 align:middle line:84%
It's about the past.
OK.

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The past is not
going to change--

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much I think it
should have been different.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And I'm here
in this present moment.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.209 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:56.209 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So then E allows you to express
your feelings that come up when

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:02.187 align:middle line:84%
you think the thought my
husband's death is the worst

00:33:02.187 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.297 align:middle line:84%
So journal-- vent
all of the thoughts--

00:33:05.297 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Talk about it.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.950 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: All
of the feelings.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Get it off your chest.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe take two, three,
five minutes on that step.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll--
you'll also welcome it.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it has some
wisdom for you.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I think you know,
like, if you had

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
a four-year-old--
I know you have

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.349 align:middle line:84%
a daughter who's 10 now, right?
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:33:23.349 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But when-- imagine when she was
four and she skinned her knee.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And she'd come in
running, Mommy, Mommy,

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.678 align:middle line:90%
I skinned my knee.

00:33:28.678 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And to her, it's like
the end of the world.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Right
-Would you go stop crying?

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:90%
No, you'd say come on my lap.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
What happened?
LISA GARR: Right.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:36.899 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's the energy we want to
have with our painful thoughts.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:84%
When we make war
with our thoughts,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:90%
we increase our stress.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And just like a
four-year-old child,

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
their tantrum will increase.
LISA GARR: Ah, yes.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Because they have some--

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It does drive
the thoughts deeper.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.573 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: They have
something to tell us.

00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:53.897 align:middle line:90%
Just like my nightmares--

00:33:53.897 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Are
telling you something.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Every
night, you know, seeing him

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:90%
die again and again and again.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I did not enjoy that.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But it had some gift hidden
in that-- to call me to wake

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:90%
up to the present moment.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So our painful thoughts have
a gift for us if we can--

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: A beautiful
way of looking at it.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.350 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: --find it.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.916 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes, if you
can find the gift in it.

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:12.735 align:middle line:90%
But they're there.

00:34:12.735 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: They are there.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:84%
And then A for the Peace Method
stands for can you accept it?

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So my husband's
death is the worst

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
The acceptance would sound
like, well, that could be so.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I can allow that.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:90%
I can accept that as true.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.885 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to make
war with that idea.

00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So-- and even just
that is more peaceful.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
When we make war with ideas,
it increases our stress.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.401 align:middle line:84%
It-- it prematurely ages
ourselves by up to a decade.

00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Wow.
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:45.769 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah, I
can understand that.

00:34:45.769 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:90%
That adds aging to grief.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: As you go through
this process, again and again,

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
different times of the day or
if it's different days, do you

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:84%
notice that it gets
easier and easier?

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to continue
to go through the process.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But does--
AURORA WINTER: It gets easier.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It gets faster.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
You become friendly with your
own wisdom-- your own guidance.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Why do we want to
speed up grieving so much?

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've been asked this.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well, who--
I want to speed it up, too.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm all about let's get to
the nut of this quickly.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, people suffer
five to eight years typically.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's not their fault
they don't know what to do.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But my experiences with
the Peace Method, people

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
can get through it sometimes
in one 30-minute session.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in a month doing it
on their own-- 30 minutes a day.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But you can get through
it much more quickly.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- there's
two kinds of pain.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.660 align:middle line:90%
One is sort of the clean pain.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:84%
My husband died--
clean the pain.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like agony.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I loved him.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But the dirty pain is all
the thoughts that I project.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It was my fault is dirty pain.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll always be
alone is dirty pain.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.270 align:middle line:90%
My son won't be OK-- dirty pain.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Those are all-- so
it's-- like tears

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:90%
are a shower for the soul.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to erase
grief in my point of view.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the clean
part of grief is just-- it's

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
the front of the hand--
the back of the hand--

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.090 align:middle line:90%
grief, love, grief, love.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
If you are a person with a
whole heart, you will love

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and you will grieve.
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to have the
dirty pain with the getting

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the well of
grief-- with being

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:90%
paralyzed and immobilized.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.821 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And projecting all
of your thoughts around it.

00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, and not
being able to get out of bed

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:90%
or not being able to love again.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So we want to let
go of those parts.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.582 align:middle line:90%
And then it can even be sweet.

00:36:40.582 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, when my son gets
married, I will have a moment.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I might even cry.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, gosh, I wish
my husband was here.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:90%
But it will be tears of love.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It will be a beautiful thing.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It won't be tears of anger.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.745 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: The tears
that debilitate you.

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.310 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: No.
-Yes.

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: It'll
be a celebration

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that I still love him and
would have loved to have him

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:90%
be at my son's wedding.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
verbs to conjugate.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Anyway, so go
back to the Peace Methods?

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes, yes.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: OK,
so you can do-- the A

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.370 align:middle line:84%
can either just be to
allow or accept what

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is without making a war on it.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can even look,
is there something

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
you can appreciate-- just like
the front of the hand, back

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:90%
of the hand.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So I could appreciate my
husband's death as the worst

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I would only feel that way
if we had had a great love.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So I can appreciate
the time we shared.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:90%
I can appreciate the love.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.605 align:middle line:90%
I can appreciate our son.

00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:34.422 align:middle line:84%
I already start to feel
better, right-- appreciation.

00:37:34.422 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Then, the next step
of the Peace Method

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:90%
is to consider the contrary.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So considering the
contrary, what's

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the opposite to
my husband's death

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:84%
was the worst thing that
ever happened to me?

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious it was the best
thing that ever happened to me.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's a big step.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.750 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: That's a big
step but just try it on.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's like going shopping.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Like if you and I go shopping
together, and I say, Lisa,

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you would look awesome
in that red dress.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.925 align:middle line:84%
You might say red
is not my color.

00:38:02.925 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, just try it on.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.960 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to buy it.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.469 align:middle line:84%
So you try--
LISA GARR: OK.

00:38:07.469 --> 00:38:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You try it on-- just
like you do at the store.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can go, holy moly,
you were right, Aurora.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:90%
This dress-- I look awesome.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to buy it.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Or you can go, I tried it on.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.804 align:middle line:84%
It's not me.
All right.

00:38:18.804 --> 00:38:22.051 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, just
try it on playfully.

00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And--
LISA GARR: Try on the phrase.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.917 align:middle line:84%
Try on the idea of acceptance
of that that's the best

00:38:26.917 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:90%
thing that could have happened.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.416 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: The whole
thing-- just try it

00:38:29.416 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%
on to discover your own wisdom.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I try on
my husband's death

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
was the best thing that
ever happened to me,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.772 align:middle line:90%
I find deep truth in that.

00:38:38.772 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:90%
In some ways, it was.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Through his death, he became
my greatest spiritual teacher.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Through his death, I got clear
on what really matters in life.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not making
a lot of money.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not having the big house.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
It's people.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.320 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes, relationships.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's being of service.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:90%
It's making a difference.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And through his death, you
know, fast forward now 20 years,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a catalyst
for other people

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to get through their loss, to
shine their light brightly,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and to make a
difference in the world.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I can really take that on
and say, yeah, that's true.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But how long do
you think it should take

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.347 align:middle line:84%
someone to get to that place?
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.347 --> 00:39:19.180 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I mean, you went
through this great process.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And now you're helping
other people with it.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's a-- that's a
wonderful thing to do.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you coach people, do
say five years-- five months--

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.520 align:middle line:90%
or is it different for everyone?

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, the honest answer
to that is I think

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
should is about the most violent
word in the English language.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I catch myself
even to replace

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.630 align:middle line:90%
should with could or would.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
much a limiting belief

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's to honor
the person who

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
died to stay mired in grief.
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like how long should it
take for a broken arm to heal?

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Months, weeks, maybe,
you know, not five years.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:90%
So but--

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.621 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Not days, either.
-Yeah.

00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right?

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But-- but you do
you take action.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:90%
You go to the doctor.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:90%
You put on the cast.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:90%
You da da da da da.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:90%
People get stuck in grief.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And partly, I think it's--
you know, grief, I think,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:84%
is like you're walking along the
park on a beautiful sunny day.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.041 align:middle line:84%
You don't notice, and
you walk into a hole.

00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:23.740 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can stay stuck in
the bottom of that dark hole

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:84%
forever, but with-- but
with a step-by-step recipe--

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.060 align:middle line:84%
if somebody comes
along or if you

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:84%
use the Peace Method at
home alone, you can go,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:90%
hey, I'm not alone.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's a road map, and
step-by-step I can walk up.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have a grief
coach, you know,

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
they'll shine a flashlight down
there-- say you're not alone.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:84%
A friend can say
you're not alone.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.594 align:middle line:90%
I'm here and have patience.

00:40:47.594 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, and there's
a lot of cultural beliefs also

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that go along with
honoring the dead

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and taking the time to grieve.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And it can be decades.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
certain cultures--

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've
heard from in the process

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:90%
of you bringing out your work.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.540 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well, I say
honor your relationship

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.300 align:middle line:84%
with the person who died
by making their death be

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.560 align:middle line:90%
meaningful not meaningless.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And how you can best make it
meaningful is transcend it

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:84%
yourself and then do something--
whether it's just to be

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
a better mother to your own
children because you can get

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:84%
out of bed-- or whether it's
Mothers Against Drunk Driving

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's starting the
Grief Coach Academy or becoming

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
a grief coach or like what
you're doing, Lisa, spreading

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.480 align:middle line:90%
the word-- helping people--

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.720 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right, right.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to honor your love
by doing something of meaning.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.975 align:middle line:90%
That's my challenge.

00:41:36.975 --> 00:41:39.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That makes
a huge amount of sense.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.430 align:middle line:90%
It gets you unstuck, too.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can be a sponsor
to someone who is grieving.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like an AA sponsor
is someone who's recovering,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:84%
you could-- you
could do anything,

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.750 align:middle line:90%
even if it's in a small way.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You could spend those moments
of grieving to go and spend

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
more time with your children or
something and do something fun.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.030 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of my
friend, and I-- I-- I mean,

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:84%
there's so many things that
you're talking about that

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.551 align:middle line:90%
could so much help her.

00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well, I think
Mother Teresa said it right.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.010 align:middle line:90%
We can do no great things.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.200 align:middle line:84%
We can only do small
things with great love.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's very true.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it-- it is
not a small thing

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to call somebody who's
heartbroken and say, hey,

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll listen.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not a small thing to say,
hey, I'm not a grief coach,

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:90%
but I'll pay for you to get one.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not a small thing to just
say, I don't know what to say.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But I could come on over
and babysit the kids

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like to go to the gym.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk a little
bit about what to say

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and what not to say to
someone who is grieving.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you've really
written the handbook on this.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it-- it's
saying things that people

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
say just because we've
always heard them.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.054 align:middle line:84%
But they are more harmful
than they are good.

00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:45.920 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Absolutely.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me come to that
in just a second.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And let me just finish
the Peace Method.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:49.529 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The last step is the E of the
Peace Method is for enthusiasm.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
consciously choose?

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And so that could be an action.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be helping
somebody else.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:90%
It could be going to the gym.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It could be eating better.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be, like, I consciously
choose that-- you know,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to help other people get
through grief more quickly.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:84%
First, I chose to share my story
"From Heartbreak to Happiness"

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
to help other people
know they're not alone--

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:90%
that grieving is a process.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the founder of
the Grief Coach Academy,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
give them a tool--
the Peace Method,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.740 align:middle line:84%
which they can work through
their grief in 30 minutes.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But what is it for you
on your painful thought?

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So don't just leave it with
exploring your feelings.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Make a decision and take
some action-- no matter

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.890 align:middle line:84%
how small-- even if it's
only to write one email

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:84%
or spend five minutes
checking out something

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%
or go out for a walk or spend
five minutes in the sunshine.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.169 align:middle line:84%
Take some action no matter
how small at the end

00:43:41.169 --> 00:43:42.035 align:middle line:90%
of doing the Peace Method.

00:43:42.035 --> 00:43:43.580 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That gives
you a little bit of joy.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: A
little bit of joy.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.341 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Back and then those
little moments of joy stack up.

00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Eh.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
mean by enthusiasm?

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.939 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: They really do.

00:43:48.939 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what I
mean by enthusiasm.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I chose the
word enthusiasm

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.611 align:middle line:84%
because it means, like, "en
theo," to be filled with God.

00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:56.310 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Hm.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
choose to be filled

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
with God or spirit about?
LISA GARR: Very good.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that,
as you said, exercise.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It can be sunlight.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.910 align:middle line:90%
It could be a connection.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything--
looking at the veins

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in leaves-- whatever
gives you just

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:90%
a moment of connection and joy.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.123 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: A little bit
of joy-- fresh raspberries.

00:44:14.123 --> 00:44:15.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Fresh
raspberries-- good.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.310 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Exactly.
LISA GARR: Good for you.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.009 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:44:17.009 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So
that's a great way--

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that's a great thing
to say, though--

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.600 align:middle line:84%
the chips in a
chocolate chip cookie--

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.774 align:middle line:90%
little things like that--

00:44:22.774 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Little things.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.750 align:middle line:90%
---is really what it means.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.550 align:middle line:10%
AURORA WINTER: And helping
other people is the fastest

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:10%
way to get out of yourself.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.780 align:middle line:10%
So if you're feeling really low,
paradoxically getting out there

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:10%
and helping somebody
who is dealing with even

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:10%
more challenges can be great.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:10%
So the Peace Method,
just those five steps:

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:10%
come into the present moment,
express your feelings,

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:10%
accept or appreciate,
consider the contrary,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.510 align:middle line:10%
and end with enthusiasm.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And then now, do
you-- the Grief Wheel,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is that a part of
the Peace process?

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: The
Grief Wheel is actually

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.190 align:middle line:84%
a different coaching
process that we teach

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:90%
at the Grief Coach Academy.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:10%
So I teach over a dozen
different coaching processes

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:10%
that take about 30
minutes each to give

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:10%
people a step-by-step recipe.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.790 align:middle line:10%
And they can get some videos
with some free coach training

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.464 align:middle line:10%
online, as well, at
griefcoachacademy.com.

00:45:06.464 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Which is great.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.704 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
train coaches, right?

00:45:08.704 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: And
I train coaches.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Which is a terrific way for
people to be able to continue

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.104 align:middle line:84%
on and to help, as well.
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:45:14.104 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And I like
the fact that you have

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
several different tools because
it's not just one tool that's

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.564 align:middle line:90%
going to work for everyone.

00:45:19.564 --> 00:45:20.330 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Exactly.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
levels of the processes where

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.920 align:middle line:90%
you go in and out, up and down.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So going through
the different tools

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.020 align:middle line:84%
is just a way of staying
in action about something.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Staying in
action is so important.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I like about the
Peace Method is kind of like

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.210 align:middle line:84%
if people want to get
fit, what would be

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:90%
one class that you'd recommend?

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So the Peace Method is
kind of the equivalent of

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.960 align:middle line:90%
your favorite power yoga class.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It hits five different
muscle groups.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.279 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:45:45.279 --> 00:45:46.930 align:middle line:84%
---so to speak, but
that doesn't mean that

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not important to also
eat right and meditate

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and do other things.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have other processes
at the Grief Coach Academy.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Did you want me to talk
about what to say--

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.920 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes.
-And what not to say?

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Very,
very helpful, yes.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.460 align:middle line:84%
What-- what would you say to
someone that would be-- well,

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.571 align:middle line:84%
let's start with
what not to say.

00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: OK.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the
most common stuff.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:03.855 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Basically--

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I've said
this before to people.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.239 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Basically if
it's coming out of your mouth

00:46:08.239 --> 00:46:11.096 align:middle line:84%
automatically and everybody else
says it, probably not helpful.

00:46:11.096 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Such as--

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.774 align:middle line:84%
Such as I'm sorry--
not so helpful.

00:46:14.774 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Not so helpful.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.880 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you
why in a second.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It was just God's will.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Be grateful you had him so long.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Um, I--

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You'll
find another husband.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:90%
You'll find it or you're young.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.690 align:middle line:90%
You can have another child.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.114 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes.
Ooh, yeah.

00:46:30.114 --> 00:46:31.710 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are not so helpful.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Basically anything that tries
to minimize the person's

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.550 align:middle line:84%
authentic experience with
some automatic shield comment

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:90%
is not helpful.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm sorry
is kind of a 50-50 one--

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.610 align:middle line:84%
if people who knew my husband
said I'm sorry, that was

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:90%
fine because they were sorry.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:53.480 align:middle line:84%
They knew him.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody who never
knew him-- didn't know me

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, asked me
out on a date and said,

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, how long
have you been divorced?

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, well,
actually, I'm a widow.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're like I'm
sorry, it's disconnecting

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because it projects this
whole story about me.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.767 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
even know who I am.

00:47:10.767 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: So it's inauthentic?

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.891 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: It's inauthentic
and it can convey pity.

00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:15.590 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Hm.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So my son hated it when people
said I'm sorry because he's,

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:19.910 align:middle line:90%
like, I'm not a victim.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't throw your
pity party on me.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sorry can land like that.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's better to
if you knew the person,

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.220 align:middle line:84%
say, gosh, I really--
I really loved Peter.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I especially remember this
one time when we went hiking

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.170 align:middle line:84%
or he was so kind when my
son was looking for a job.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He did da da da-- like,
tell a little story

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.881 align:middle line:84%
about it, that's helpful.
LISA GARR: It is?

00:47:40.881 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
People love to share
those cherished memories.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And try not to project
on the other person.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Let them be wherever they're at.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Grief is not sadness.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Grief, as you know
from reading my book,

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.610 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole bunch of
different emotions.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:56.400 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.799 align:middle line:84%
It's anger.
It's fear.

00:47:57.799 --> 00:47:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It's denial.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a moment of
going I'm alive.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.494 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what a miracle.

00:48:03.494 --> 00:48:04.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah, yes.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Not taking things for
granted, like, huh, life.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's true.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.650 align:middle line:84%
When death brushes us
by, we have a wake-up call

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:90%
that we may not have 40 years.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it calls us into,
wow, take a moment.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Just look at-- enjoy the moment.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.974 align:middle line:84%
Look at the sunset.
So--

00:48:22.974 --> 00:48:24.140 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then
you can go back

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.566 align:middle line:84%
to denial and anger
and resentment

00:48:25.566 --> 00:48:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and fear and all that.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.190 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.950 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And then
you can go back

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:28.640 align:middle line:90%
into those moments [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.173 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: But I
think it's like a slinky.

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You go back around-- you come
back around anger or denial.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.071 align:middle line:84%
But you start on the floor,
and you're working your way up.

00:48:35.071 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: OK.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so some
good things to say

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:84%
are-- you'll remember
this because it'll

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.555 align:middle line:84%
be your truth if this
is what's coming up--

00:48:42.555 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to say.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Fine, because it's authentic.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
will be-- much better

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to have an authentic I
don't know what to say

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:90%
than an automatic I'm sorry.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.920 align:middle line:90%
My heart goes out to you.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.924 align:middle line:90%
You're not alone.

00:48:58.924 --> 00:49:00.680 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Those are acceptable?
-I'm here.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Those are things
you would want to hear?

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:02.630 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yes.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:03.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Hm mm.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got a support
team, and I'm on it.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's not so much
about what you say as just

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.610 align:middle line:84%
being willing to
be a space to hear

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.200 align:middle line:90%
whatever's going on for them.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:90%
They may want to talk about it.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.640 align:middle line:84%
They may not want
to talk about it.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And that could change
from minute to minute.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:24.126 align:middle line:84%
You had said once is it
OK to say to someone that,

00:49:24.126 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:84%
um-- that there are resources
available, or is that--

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.260 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah,
I think you want to--

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:84%
in that initial conversation
with somebody heartbroken,

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.180 align:middle line:84%
your third step would
be around resources.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But first, you want to
acknowledge the situation;

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:84%
then, listen without fixing;
and then, your third step

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.170 align:middle line:84%
is to give hope
and encouragement,

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.780 align:middle line:84%
which could be like there
are resources available.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.810 align:middle line:84%
There are grief
coaches available.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:52.005 align:middle line:84%
You can visit the Grief Coach
Academy-- get some free videos

00:49:52.005 --> 00:49:58.140 align:middle line:84%
or free book, you know,
or other experiences like

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.260 align:middle line:90%
"From Heartbreak to Happiness."

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I thought that
would be my only gift

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:90%
to grieving people.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's helpful to know,
hey, you know, I suffered.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I was heartbroken,
and I'm happy now.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I could-- I did it.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:90%
You can, too.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So encouraging somebody
can show up different ways.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But you first want
to acknowledge

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:14.961 align:middle line:90%
and then listen without fixing.

00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:16.860 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Let's talk about
that-- listen without fixing.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into
that for a second.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that active listening?

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.607 align:middle line:84%
What is an example of
listen without fixing?

00:50:22.607 --> 00:50:24.040 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: You're
a natural coach here.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.580 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I-- I
want to dive in.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I want to find out.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.780 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Well, there
are three levels of listening.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we teach at
the Grief Coach Academy

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is to listen with that deep
level three of listening.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So most people--
normal population--

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.574 align:middle line:90%
they're waiting to talk.

00:50:38.574 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They're not really listening.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.044 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right, right.

00:50:41.044 --> 00:50:42.210 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER:
Level two listening,

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:84%
you hear what the person
is literally saying.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But level three of listening,
you hear what they're saying.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.547 align:middle line:84%
And you hear also
the hidden messages--

00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:52.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Underneath.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.060 align:middle line:84%
---underneath, and
you meet them where

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.970 align:middle line:90%
their emotional energy is.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So somebody might
say the same thing,

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and I would respond
quite differently

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.340 align:middle line:84%
depending on what's not
being said-- you know,

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.570 align:middle line:90%
the energy around it.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So somebody might
say, oh, I just found

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:90%
out my mom has got cancer.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know, level
two listening-- well,

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:84%
level one listening is, oh,
well, my friend had cancer,

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and she died last week.
Not good.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right, right.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Level two listening is, oh,
they have this new cancer

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:24.030 align:middle line:90%
resource available.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.200 align:middle line:90%
That's still not too great.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But level three
listening might be

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to hear that she
wants some support,

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, wow, you
know, tell me about it.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to come over
so I can have dinner with you?

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Or what was your
relationship like--

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.620 align:middle line:84%
good, fair, poor, mixed-- give
her an opportunity to share.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So go and just
allow the space and be quiet.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, one of
the keys to being a great coach

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:53.750 align:middle line:84%
is to have befriended every
part of your own life.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The reason why most people
aren't good listeners is

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.890 align:middle line:84%
because, if I said to you,
I just found out my mom's

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:84%
got cancer, all the
buttons within you,

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.400 align:middle line:84%
you know-- what if
my mom gets cancer?

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.000 align:middle line:90%
What if I get cancer?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.650 align:middle line:84%
What if-- you know,
all that comes up.

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't leave you
available to be a really great

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.266 align:middle line:84%
coach to-- I'm not saying
you personally, but you know,

00:52:14.266 --> 00:52:15.610 align:middle line:84%
as an example.
LISA GARR: Right, yeah.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And so part of
being a great coach

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is to really befriend and
transcend all of your buttons

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:24.510 align:middle line:90%
so that you can be there.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:26.240 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I think
everyone can use

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.520 align:middle line:90%
that advice, Aurora, really.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- listening is
such an important part of being

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.530 align:middle line:84%
a person and to have the first
word out of your mouth always

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:90%
be "I" is so disconnecting.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm very sensitive to that.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And yes, to have-- to even when
you're talking with a friend

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:44.670 align:middle line:84%
about a bad day or if it's
a situation that happened,

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.755 align:middle line:84%
oh, I had a situation like
that doesn't serve anyone.

00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:49.520 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: No.
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.150 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: No, it doesn't.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:54.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Just-- just a little
moment of awareness that I-- I

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:55.291 align:middle line:90%
appreciate you saying that.

00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:56.490 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah,
and that's what

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I love about the Peace Method.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It invites you to listen
to yourself, you know,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.870 align:middle line:84%
because you can
do it by yourself

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:90%
as a journaling process.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And there's great wisdom there.

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Self-censoring--
a little bit,

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:90%
yeah, a little bit, yes.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So have you seen people really
transform grief in 30 minutes--

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.500 align:middle line:90%
one chunk at a time?

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.330 align:middle line:84%
As it is-- I mean, what have
you seen in your experience?

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.700 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: I like to under
promise and over deliver.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But the honest
answer to that is I

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
have seen people have one
30-minute session with me

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and have a life-changing shift.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not guaranteeing that.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not every time, but--
LISA GARR: Right.

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It-- it-- it has happened
that people have had something

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:84%
weighing on their heart
for 4 and 1/2 years--

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.561 align:middle line:84%
really grieving.
One session--

00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:41.260 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS]

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.050 align:middle line:84%
---less than half
an hour, completely

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:45.750 align:middle line:90%
seeing it another way.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And that woman, you
know, said her eyes

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.630 align:middle line:90%
were a different color.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:50.330 align:middle line:84%
She had joy in her
heart that she hadn't

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:52.210 align:middle line:90%
felt for 4 and 1/2 years.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Three months later, I
checked in with her.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.100 align:middle line:84%
She was able to make more
money, be more joyful,

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.920 align:middle line:84%
be more present for her
kids, started dating-- like,

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.440 align:middle line:84%
her whole life shifted
from one 30-minute session.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't guarantee that.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.460 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.777 align:middle line:90%
But it-- even if--

00:54:05.777 --> 00:54:06.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Her
life started again.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.930 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Her life--
yeah, her life started again.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like a booster
cable on a car.

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And I-- I've
always wondered-- I

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.840 align:middle line:90%
always ask you about your son.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In his process of
grieving-- and I

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
know you have a lot of great
advice for parents of children

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:26.320 align:middle line:84%
who are dealing with grief,
as well-- how is your son now?

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And how has he coped
with everything, and--

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:29.870 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: He's so great.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my biggest worry
was was my son going

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to be permanently
damaged from his dad

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:35.770 align:middle line:90%
dying when he was only four?

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that so
weighed on my heart.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything I
could to try to help him.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But the quick answer
on that is the best

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.505 align:middle line:84%
thing parents can do
to help their kids

00:54:44.505 --> 00:54:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is get support yourself.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Because once mommy was
fine, my son, you know,

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.660 align:middle line:90%
worked through his grief.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:49.880 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That makes
sense because you're

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.170 align:middle line:90%
always going to be a model.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.070 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.300 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And how
you relate to it

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.780 align:middle line:84%
is how they're going
to relate to it.

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.410 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: Yeah, so--
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.380 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: It took-- he
grieved when the dog died

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.480 align:middle line:90%
four years after Daddy died.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.410 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Ah, OK.

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, whoa, the tears-- but
it wasn't just about the dog.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It was about his father.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.550 align:middle line:90%
But by then, I was grounded.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.880 align:middle line:84%
He knew I could hold
a space for him.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Kids are so sensitive to
how's mommy and daddy doing.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.219 align:middle line:84%
So--
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:55:14.219 --> 00:55:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Quick answer--
focus on yourself.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.290 align:middle line:84%
That is the biggest
gift for your child.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But my son now is
designing video games.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:22.330 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, so he's thriving.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:23.045 align:middle line:90%
He's thriving.

00:55:23.045 --> 00:55:25.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you help
so many people thrive.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.330 align:middle line:90%
And I so appreciate what you do.

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And to assist you in any
way to get your message out,

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.767 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful to be able
to have the opportunity to do.

00:55:32.767 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Thank you.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.984 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Aurora.

00:55:35.984 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:84%
AURORA WINTER: It's an honor
and privilege to be part

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.444 align:middle line:84%

You're awesome.

00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, I got to
say that you are a gift.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:41.560 align:middle line:90%
AURORA WINTER: Thank you.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.320 align:middle line:84%

right through to their hearts.
