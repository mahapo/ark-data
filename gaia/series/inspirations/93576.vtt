00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So, would like to live forever?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.120 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It means that you can live
healthy past 150 years old,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:90%
but healthy is the key.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
Bill Andrews is committed to.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
He is a molecular
biologist and athlete

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and the CEO of Sierra Sciences.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Bill is committed
to curing aging,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and he is pushing the envelope.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
He wants to extend
human longevity

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
using regenerative medicine.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And his motto is "live
forever or die trying."

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Bill is joining us
today with his wife,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Molly Sheridan, also
an ultra-marathoner who

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is on this journey with Bill
for life, however long that is.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.697 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BILL ANDREWS: Thank you.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MOLLY SHERIDAN: Thank you.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.773 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So glad to
have you guys here.

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And your energy
level is so high,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I just have to ask you,
just right off the bat,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:90%
about the ultra-marathons.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that you
do for joy and you love it?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you absolutely love
ultra-marathoning, Bill?

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.862 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I actually consider
them restful vacations.

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A 100 mile race?

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.095 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: It's like, yeah.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:90%
What an escape from it all.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:90%
They're fun.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
If I don't do one
like once a month,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I go through withdrawals.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Once a month?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, do you
train in the meantime?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.362 align:middle line:84%
So you run a 100 mile
race, without sleeping.

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Right.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For-- how long
does that take you?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I've never
broken 20 hours, but typically

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
between 20 and 24 hours.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow!

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.878 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And
sometimes, depending

00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:43.066 align:middle line:90%
on the course, a lot longer.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.399 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then what about you?

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:90%
When did you get into this?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: I started running,
actually, when I was 48.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So I was a late bloomer.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's right.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: And
so I just thought

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
it was fascinating,
reading about people

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
that went distance.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
it was amazing.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.955 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just
a grand adventure.

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you are both in
this wonderful movie called

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
"The Immortalists."

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And you are one of the
stars of the film, where

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
you are committed to living
forever or dying trying.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
What gives you that type
of motivation, Bill?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: I just love living.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
It's-- I mean, I've even--

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It all started, I
guess, when I was 10.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
My father said, you
know, Bill, since you're

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
so interested in science and
medicine, when you grow up,

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
you should find
a cure for aging.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I had always,
even at 10, I wanted

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to be there when we find
life on other planets.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And the future was always
so interesting to me.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that, you
know, I might miss the future,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
because I might die of
old age before then.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.522 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
first things first,

00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
cure aging, and then

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do all
the other things.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
when I was 10.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.118 align:middle line:84%
And all through high school,
college, everything, everybody

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
knew me as somebody who was
determined of try to figure out

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the aging process
and how to stop it.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still doing it.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.121 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk
about the science behind this.

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:04.255 align:middle line:84%
Now can you tell us
about the discovery that

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
was made about the telomeres
and the scientific Nobel

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Prize that was won around that?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.387 align:middle line:84%
Why was that such a
significant discovery?

00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Well, OK.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the, let's say,
late 1970s, early 1980s,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
it was discovered that
telomeres get shorter as we age.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.493 align:middle line:84%
And there seemed to be a strong
correlation between the length

00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:32.717 align:middle line:84%
of your telomeres
and your overall age.

00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, the
length of your telomeres

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and your overall health.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
People started noticing that
there were some people that

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
were really sick
at young ages had

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.775 align:middle line:84%
short telomeres
like old people do.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a big
correlation determined,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and people start speculating
that maybe this had something

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.072 align:middle line:84%
to do with our
health and our aging.

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
This was Blackburn, Carol
Greider and Jack Szostak

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.795 align:middle line:84%
won the Nobel Prize in Medicine
for elucidating all this

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and showing the
correlations and stuff.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered an
activity in a single cell

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
pond scum organism,
called Tetrahymena, that

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
seemed to keep the
telomeres from shortening.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Telomeres are like the
tips of our chromosomes.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
You think of a chromosome
like a shoelace.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The caps on your shoelaces
are the telomeres

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:90%
of our chromosomes.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when the caps on
our shoelaces get short,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle line:90%
our shoelaces fall apart.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the same
thing that happens

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
when the telomeres on our
chromosomes get short.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Our chromosomes fall apart.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we discovered that
this telomere shortening

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
occurs in every cell of our body
except our reproductive cells.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And if it did happen in
our reproductive cells,

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
then our children would be born
older than we, or-- yeah, older

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
with shorter
telomeres than we are.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there had to be something
they kept them from, ah,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:90%
shortening.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered this
enzyme called telomerase.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.494 align:middle line:84%
And that enzyme keeps the
telomeres from shortening.

00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm just
curious, but what

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
is the telomeres'
function in the cell?

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
They're outside of
the cells, right?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.064 align:middle line:84%
So then, how do they cause
the cell to regenerate?

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: The telomeres
are inside the cells.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, they're inside, OK.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.311 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: They're
inside the nucleus

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
at certain phases
of the cell cycle.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But the-- they're-- like
the shoelace analogy,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.964 align:middle line:84%
they're actually part
of the chromosome.

00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They're actually just
the tips the chromosome,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
which are found
inside your cells.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the shorter
that those get,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
then the cell starts to
shrivel and shrink and not

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.082 align:middle line:90%
replicate in a healthy way.

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And it's
been speculated

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
for close to 20 years that
somehow the telomeres fold back

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
onto the chromosomes to
turn genes on and off,

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or effect their
expression levels.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And now it's been
actually shown,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
just in the last few
months, that that's actually

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:90%
what is happening.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:90%
That the telomeres fold back.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And when the
telomeres get shorter,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
they're less able to
reach over to those genes.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm, hm.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
That is fascinating.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's been a new
and recent discovery,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
even since the film
came out, basically?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: The discovery
that-- the proof-- I mean,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
it was speculated,
because it was like, well,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:90%
how else could it be happening?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But the proof kind of just
came a few months ago, yes,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:90%
after the film was finished.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So really,
the cure to aging

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.225 align:middle line:84%
does have to do with
telomeres and telomerase.

00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It really-- I mean, there's
many different solutions,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
but that's a big one, isn't it?

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I think
there's no way we're ever

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
going to see a cure for
aging unless we figure out

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
how to solve the telomere
shortening problem.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And once we solve the telomere
shorting problem, that

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean we've cured
aging; it means that we, like,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'll give myself
another 30 to 40 years of life

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
figure out how to--

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Healthy.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah,
healthy life, too.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Figure out how to cure the next
problem that causes us to age.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I think of them like
sticks of dynamite

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:90%
that are burning inside of us.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And which stick of dynamite
has the shortest fuse,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, is the telomeres
on the tips of our chromosomes.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean there's
other sticks of dynamite that

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:90%
aren't burning out there.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, my opinion is
the healthy part.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And you, Molly, would love
to live a ripe age healthy

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and not fall prey to the
degenerative diseases that

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But what does your mindset
have to do with that?

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.836 align:middle line:84%
Do you really believe
that that's possible?

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think we just need to
get people in front of Bill.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so interesting,
the science out there.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And most of us who don't
have a science background,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:84%
or aren't up to
date, don't realize

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that it's a real science
and what they have learned.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the future is promising,
you know, for health.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And people, instead of
getting older and more ill,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.825 align:middle line:90%
staying healthier longer.

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the key.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because aging is
just broken down cells

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
not regenerating or regenerating
the wrong way, right?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.927 align:middle line:84%
And that-- a disease, I
mean, disease is, right?

00:07:58.927 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: They're broken down.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:90%
They-- yeah.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a phase
when the cells get

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
really old that
they do break down.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.339 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's long after
the aging really has occurred.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
The aging has actually
occurred by the changes

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
in gene expression.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
We've been able, at least when
Petri-- human cells in Petri

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
dishes show that when we
re-lengthen the telomeres,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the genes actually go back
to the exact same expression

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.391 align:middle line:84%
patterns that they had
when they were young.

00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Which means the
cells didn't really break down.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:90%
They just changed.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And that change is reversible.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
detoxification, though.

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, doesn't
that have to do,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to
regenerate the cell,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you want to regenerate it
without the toxins in it,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the toxins are going to
go away by other mechanisms

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
like with Aubrey de Grey,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
he's very right when he
says that we accumulate

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of junk in our cells
as our cells get older.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a chance
that if we can lengthen

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres,
that junk is going

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:90%
to disappear all on its own.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Simply by the fact that when the
junk will quit being produced,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and as the cells divide,
the junk gets diluted out,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
there's no more junk.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that's
what's going to happen,

00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, we
won't know until we

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.771 align:middle line:84%
have a way of preventing the
telomeres from shortening.

00:09:20.771 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the natural
detoxification mechanism

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
inside the cell will just
be enhanced and work better,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.855 align:middle line:90%
one would hope.

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:27.646 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Exactly.

00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope that's the way, yes.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.616 align:middle line:84%
So also, you had said,
both, I believe, in the film

00:09:32.616 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
or at some point, that
the telomeres start

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:90%
shortening after we're born.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.687 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
automatic-- is that--

00:09:38.687 --> 00:09:40.728 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: No, they start
shortening from the day

00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:41.554 align:middle line:90%
you're conceived.

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh that!

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I think, as long
as there's still telomerase

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
being produced-- the earliest
stage that I've heard that you

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
can see telomeres shortening is
at the eight cell embryo stage.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.665 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: You can
still see telomeres.

00:09:56.665 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
When you go to 16 cells,
apparently, there's

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.525 align:middle line:84%
still-- there's some shortening
that you can observe there.

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:02.025 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's
one cell that's

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
not having any
shortening, and that cell

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:84%
ends up becoming your
reproductive cells.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.226 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: But the other
cells all start shortening.

00:10:11.226 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So you're aging from
the day you're born,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
or the day you're conceived,
but you don't really

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
start showing the signs
of aging until much,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.827 align:middle line:90%
much later after you're born.

00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've got
to be growing also?

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
The cells have to be
in growth and decline

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.449 align:middle line:90%
at a different rate, right?

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, there's
development and there's aging.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Those are actually
two different things.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.293 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: So what
we're talking about

00:10:32.293 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
is controlling the
aging without really

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:90%
controlling the development.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine if we
took a 65-year-old person,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
let's say we find a way to
reverse that person's aging,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.966 align:middle line:84%
that person would
go back to about 24.

00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I think most
developmental scientists

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.457 align:middle line:84%
say that we pretty much quit
developing when we're 24.

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
reverse development, just

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:90%
reverse the aging.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I mean,
what I hear you

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
talking about is not necessarily
living to be 1,000 years old.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You're really talking about
improving the quality of life

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
while you're on
the planet, and not

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.424 align:middle line:84%
falling prey to the
degenerative diseases, right?

00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
you're talking about?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Exactly, exactly.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So the whole living
to 1,000 is just

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
a sexy way of bringing
people into a topic.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.629 align:middle line:84%
But you're really talking
about health, in my opinion.

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: And who knows?

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
We might live to be 1,000.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what happens
if we, as Terry Grossman

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:84%
talks about, the
bridges that we cross?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And his famous
saying of, like, we

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out a way to live
long enough to live forever.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can figure out
ways of continually stopping

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
each of the processes
that cause us to aging--

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
cause us to age,
then eventually,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
we're going to reach
a point where we're

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be solving the
problems faster than we age.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we just keep
on going and going.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're always going
to be run over by trucks.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.433 align:middle line:84%
We're always going
to fall off cliffs.

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We're always going to have
disputes, family disputes,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and shoot each other, you know?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hopefully not.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Not in

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not in
your relationship.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.405 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up the
topic of living forever.

00:12:01.405 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
If you were to live
forever, you chose--

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%
you found your life partner.

And this is truly

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:09.342 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Oh, absolutely, yes.

00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: Well, I

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>2011 should go down in
history as a very important year

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's the very first
year that humans have ever

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.175 align:middle line:84%
been able to reverse aging
in any type of animal

00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The research lab in
Harvard has actually

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
been able to reverse
aging in mice.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And these mice
actually became younger

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
using telomere
lengthening technology.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:90%
So what is a telomere?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.604 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
A human being is made up
of 100 trillion cells.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And then inside of each of these
cells are found chromosomes.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
A chromosome is like
a long shoelace.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
At the very tips of our
shoelaces are found the caps.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Those are the telomeres.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.614 align:middle line:84%
When the caps of the shoelaces
get worn away to nothing,

00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
the shoelace starts
falling apart.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.113 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing happens
with the chromosomes.

00:13:37.113 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Telomeres shorten every
time a cell divides.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when a
telomere gets shorter,

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.205 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
a clock ticking.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.025 align:middle line:90%
The cell divides, it ticks once.

00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:54.292 align:middle line:84%
The cell divides
again, it ticks again.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It ticks again and it ticks
again and it ticks again.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, human
cells know how old they are.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
There's two words,
telomere and telomerase.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Telomerase is the enzyme
that lengthens the telomere.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
When a telomere gets shorter,
the clock ticks once,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:90%
telomerase pushes it back.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It ticks again,
telomerase pushes it back.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Similar to what Harvard
did with the mice,

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to figure out a
way to turn on telomerase in all

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:90%
of our cells.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've been screening
hundreds of thousands

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic chemicals,
looking for anything

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that would turn the
telomerase gene on.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.125 align:middle line:84%
Then the human cell would
then become immortal.

00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people told us we were
completely wasting our time,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.835 align:middle line:84%
but we found our very first
hit on the 57,684th chemical we

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:03.335 align:middle line:90%
screened.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
10 to 15 years in the future,
it will be a prescription drug

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that doctors can prescribe
to just about anybody.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:84%
My main reason for
doing this research is

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to extend my own
lifespan, my friends'

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and families' lifespans.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.202 align:middle line:90%
And we are so close.

>>LISA: Truly, how far away
are we from this technology?

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
In the movie you
say we're so close.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:90%
But how close is close?

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.922 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, what
we found is that--

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and most of it,
what we discovered,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is through gene
therapy techniques.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If we produce a little
bit of telomerase,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres will get
a little bit longer

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
and stay a little bit longer.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.613 align:middle line:84%
If we produce more
telomerase, they'll

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
get even a little bit longer
than that and stay that length.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we get the
telomerase to a certain level,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
then the telomeres actually
get longer than-- then

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
they just keep getting
longer, and that's

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:90%
when we've reversed human aging.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we have found
chemicals and natural products

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that will produce enough
telomerase in a cell

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:84%
without using gene
therapy techniques,

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
it will produce enough
telomerase inside of a cell

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to be about 16% of the
amount of telomerase

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
we need to totally
stop and reverse aging.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And we went from, like, I
would say 4% or 5% up to 16%

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:84%
in just a few months
of doing what's

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.416 align:middle line:90%
called medicinal chemistry.

00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And we were pretty--
all excited.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.373 align:middle line:84%
We thought, well,
in less than a year,

00:17:02.373 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be at
that 100-- that amount.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And we lost our funding at the
time, because lots of people

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.825 align:middle line:84%
did in 2008 from
the economic crisis.

00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we can get our
funding back, we can get going,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and we can be back up to having
a telomerase inducer that

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
will produce enough telomerase
inside of human cells

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to reverse aging in
less than a year.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%

you choose to do

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the plant-based, or
natural products,

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to a pharmaceutical
lab-based product?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, if the
plant-based stuff works,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.251 align:middle line:84%
we can get product into people's

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the plant extracts
that we've been testing

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
have already been
approved by the FDA.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.435 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: They have a
classification called GRAS,

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
G-R-A-S, which stands for
Generally Regarded as Safe.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So the FDA has already
approved these things.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So they can get on
the market as fast.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now we've already tested
over 10,000 different plant

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:84%
extracts, and we
haven't found anything--

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.019 align:middle line:84%
we found a lot of them that
actually-- I think 39 of them,

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
from 10,000 different plants--
we found 39 of them that

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
will induce an
expression of telomerase.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But not enough to
actually reverse aging.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They may slow down the
aging process a little bit,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
not actually reverse
the aging process.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We've tested over 300,000
different chemicals,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.134 align:middle line:84%
and we have found 900
different chemicals

00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%
that will do the same thing.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And these chemicals right now
are showing a lot more potency

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.899 align:middle line:84%
in inducing telomerase
than the natural products.

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take those
through clinical studies.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.315 align:middle line:84%
And it will take a long
time before people actually

00:18:38.315 --> 00:18:39.929 align:middle line:90%
can actually start using them.

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So but
they're, at some point

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
into the long
distant future, there

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
could be a pharmaceutical
drug that could reduce aging.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:49.756 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:50.255 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But in the immediate,
there is maybe-- you said,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%
a pond scum?

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Oh!

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Should we just go start
licking the bottom of ponds?

00:18:58.645 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, there is
a pond scum organism that

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
does not age, and it's
called Tetrahymena.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- they discovered,
Nobel Prize winners,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.112 align:middle line:84%
discovered that it had an
enzyme activity in it that

00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
kept the telomeres
from shortening.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
learn from that example.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
We found the same kind
of enzyme activity

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and completely characterized
it in humans now,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're just now trying
to teach human cells how

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.504 align:middle line:84%
to produce this
enzyme themselves.

00:19:25.504 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're training it
within your lab environment.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you don't
receive the funding,

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:90%
how long can you sustain?

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Or do you have a plan B?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, our
plan A was to continue

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:90%
looking for investors.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, I
decided that maybe the plan

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:90%
B is a better approach.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's to just start getting
some products on the market

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%

But we made it known that
if some other marketing

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
company wants to put some
products on the market,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
we will license some of
the discoveries we made.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:90%
So we've done that.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Product B is an example of that.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So is some skin
creams that are being

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.165 align:middle line:84%
sold in Australia
called One Truth 818,

00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:14.557 align:middle line:84%
and in New Zealand
called Defy Time.

00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
These are things that are
on the market right now.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
There's other products coming
along, pet products, hair care

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
products, a bunch of things that
are going to, in my opinion,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
these things are not
going to cure aging.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They might slow
aging down a bit.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They might make-- In
the clinical studies,

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.778 align:middle line:84%
the skin has been looking like
it's getting some age reversal.

00:20:35.778 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With the creams
or with the Product B?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.865 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: With the creams.

00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm!

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: But my way
of looking at this

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is that this is bringing
in royalties to my company

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:90%
so that we can do research.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And so every penny of the
royalties that we're getting

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
is going directly into research.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't gotten enough to
actually get us back on track,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
but I predict that easily
by the-- by mid-2015,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
back on track and have

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
a real drug-- and hopefully a
natural product-- by the middle

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:84%
of 2016 that we can then
start testing in humans.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, Molly, what
is it that you do?

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Are you also in the
anti-aging world?

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.325 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: I own a company
called Desert Sky Adventures.

00:21:17.325 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the health and
fitness side of what Bill does.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage people
to walk and run

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
for health and adventure.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of go hand-in-hand
to keep from getting older.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.544 align:middle line:84%
Mine is all about promoting
moving, moving through space.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And now, how did you guys meet?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: We were at a race.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Of course.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
very unique community,

00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:42.086 align:middle line:84%
that of the 100 miler,
100 plus, right?

00:21:42.086 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Actually, yeah.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:43.793 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't.

00:21:43.793 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We were just at Lake Tahoe.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.765 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole bunch of
different events going on,

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and we bumped into each
other in the hallway.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:90%
And, kind of--

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And found that you
had this thing in common

00:21:53.635 --> 00:21:55.026 align:middle line:90%
called 100 mile plus race.

00:21:55.026 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: It kind of
grew from there, yeah.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Your story is great,
that you went to a doctor

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
when you started to
run and they told you

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that you shouldn't
be running, right?

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: My girlfriend
invited me to run a marathon.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, ew, how awful.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:90%
That sounds terrible.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I had never had a
background in running.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And she encouraged me, and
told me, oh, my gosh, we're

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:90%
going to fun.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I go, how do you have fun and
marathon in the same sentence?

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even imagine.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So she kind of
hooked me into this.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to start training.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I hurt my foot, because
I didn't have a coach,

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
didn't have proper guidance,
I didn't know anything

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:84%
about running, or really
had no background.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to the
doctor, he said, oh, my gosh.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:90%
You have a stress fracture.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.261 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh!

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm training for this marathon.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And he's going, how old are you?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.406 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, that's
a weird question.

00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:50.905 align:middle line:90%
I'm 48.

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:52.002 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh!

00:22:52.002 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:90%
You're too old to be running.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Pick a different sport.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, it was the
first time anybody ever told

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
me I was too old.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I knew that advice wasn't right.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, that
started the whole ball

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:90%
rolling with, oh, my gosh.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I really want
to do this marathon,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not too old.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I properly started training.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:90%
I never had another injury.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I took a picture myself
crossing the finish line

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.299 align:middle line:84%
and sent it to him,
and said, please

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
don't tell people that
they're too old to be running.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good for you.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: It was awesome.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So that started the
whole company thing

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%

encourage every age.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.107 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That started
your company?

00:23:28.107 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Yes, it did.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then, do you do
marathons and different runs

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:90%
for causes?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.956 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: I do 5Ks,
10Ks, half marathons.

00:23:33.956 --> 00:23:35.455 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we
do in our company

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is associated with a
charitable organization.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
We raise funds for all sorts of
organizations in our community.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about distance.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I totally get that not everybody
would want to run 100 miles.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So we really want
people to walk and run

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:90%
for a mile, two miles, 5K.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.022 align:middle line:84%
We want the whole
world to be moving.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the biggest
race of all time.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.565 align:middle line:84%
I have a pretty
incredible girlfriend.

She and I travel all over the

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:90%
She's in her 50's.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I actually didn't
start running

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.479 align:middle line:90%
until I was 48 years old.

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about running;

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I just was out there all
by myself, just training,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
and I got a stress fracture.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to the
doctor, the doctor said,

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
you are too old to be
running a marathon.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like, horrified.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:90%
At 48, that's not old.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.190 align:middle line:84%
When I crossed the finish line,
I sent him a picture of me

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.782 align:middle line:84%
and said, don't tell
people that they can't run

00:25:03.782 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:90%
and that they can't exercise.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>She actually just became
the first American woman

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to complete a race
in the Himalayas.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And she ran for 58
hours, straight hours,

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:90%
to complete that race.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>It's on the only

that's open two months

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Bill and I, we
attempted it in 2010.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Nobody had ever attempted it.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.429 align:middle line:84%
So the race starts,
we're high-tailing it

00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:41.095 align:middle line:90%
up the mountain.

00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Later in the race, I had heard
that Bill took a pit-stop.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, he wasn't
feeling great.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.865 align:middle line:84%
So the whole day, I am looking
behind me going, where is Bill.

00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:58.855 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The race director shows up and
says Bill is at the hospital.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:90%
We have to fly him out.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.886 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I--
I abandoned the race.

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:90%

I can't even go there.

00:26:20.638 --> 00:26:21.327 align:middle line:90%
I really can't.

00:26:21.327 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
It just would be horrible.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
When I got into my early
20s, I found myself

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:90%
getting engaged five times.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.285 align:middle line:84%
In every single case, it took
me a day or two of depression

00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to think, oh, no.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.049 align:middle line:84%
This is not part of
my-- my overall plan.

00:27:01.049 --> 00:27:02.715 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
interfere with my plan;

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
make things happen.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.856 align:middle line:84%
And in all cases, I went and
cancelled the engagement.

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:10.272 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got-- I got
a surprise for you.

00:27:10.272 --> 00:27:10.772 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:27:10.772 --> 00:27:11.744 align:middle line:90%

00:27:11.744 --> 00:27:13.188 align:middle line:90%
>>You got me a present?

00:27:13.188 --> 00:27:13.688 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:27:13.688 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Was it from work?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>I've gone 39 years without
ever proposing to anybody,

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.724 align:middle line:90%

00:27:23.724 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I proposed to Molly.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And so we're engaged now.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.299 align:middle line:84%

I guess we're going to the
moon, according to Bill,

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
because he's got a race up

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
He's adorable.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%

inflammation that you

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.859 align:middle line:84%
guys might have from
stress fractures,

00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:08.650 align:middle line:84%

how could what you do you
deal with inflammation?

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a leading
cause of disease

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and of pain in the
body as we age.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
solutions for that?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%

anti-inflammation?

00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I think there's
plenty of research showing

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that when your
telomeres get shorter,

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:84%
you have an increased chance
of getting inflammation,

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
doing the same things
as somebody else

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
with longer telomeres that
wouldn't get the inflammation.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, going
back to running,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I've found that if you are
a consistent runner and run

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
all the time, you
rarely get inflammation.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
inflammation is

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the major causes of
injuries in running, and stuff.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, a typical person
who runs maybe once every two

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
weeks, and then runs a marathon
typically does pretty well.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But then when they get
finished celebrating that day,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and the next day
they wake up, they

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:90%
find they're stiff as a board.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that stiffness
is all the swelling

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:12.350 align:middle line:84%
from all the immune cells
migrate into the joints,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:84%
because it thinks the joints are
under some attack by something.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
injuries start occurring.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
running all the time

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
trains your body
to say, hey, ignore

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in the joints.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not some foreign
invader attacking you.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.106 align:middle line:90%
The body gets used to it.

00:29:30.106 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
when Molly and I

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
go out and run 100 miles,
usually the next day,

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:84%
we can go out and run
another 100 miles.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.999 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe never 100
miles the next day.

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:90%
But at least a 10K.

what about heart disease?

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.587 align:middle line:90%
high cholesterol, right?

00:29:52.587 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Oh, yeah.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And well, I had plaque buildup
in my arteries and stuff

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.672 align:middle line:90%
And I still do.

00:29:59.672 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
They just haven't gotten
any worse in the last,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.679 align:middle line:90%
like, 35 years.

00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With all the running
you do, it's just genetic?

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.678 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, it's
definitely genetic.

00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, I've
had my whole genome

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:90%
analyzed by 23 and me.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So I know the genes
that are-- that I have,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:90%
which I wish I didn't have.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's, as in the
documentary, "The Immortalist,"

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
it's pointed out that
I have these things.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.548 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have
the other markers.

00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I just have a few of markers.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Specifically, a gene called LPa.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that gives you high
risk of heart disease,

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but only if you have
the other markers, too.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So I have a little
bit of plaque buildup.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
exercise and et cetera

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:90%
helps decrease the chances.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
supplements that I take

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and et cetera also help decrease
the chances of that happening.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about memory
loss and Alzheimer's?

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.691 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
father's in the movie,

00:30:48.691 --> 00:30:52.845 align:middle line:84%
and he is particularly afflicted
by those types of illnesses.

00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can what you're
talking about here

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
with the telomerase
lengthening affect the memory?

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: I hope so.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely a correlation
and a lot of literature

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
showing that people that have
different forms of dementia,

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
including Alzheimer's,
have shorter telomeres

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in their blood cells,
maybe in their glial cells,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Schwann cells, astrocyte cells.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The last three cells
are cells in the brain.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But what I was
most excited about

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
was when Dr. Ron DePinho
at Harvard and his team

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
took old mice and
lengthened their telomeres

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
using a gene therapy
type of trick.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:90%
The mice actually got younger.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And certain aspects
of brain function,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
like sense of smell and
stuff like that, came back.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it might be that we might
actually be able to reverse

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:84%
brain disorders,
including Alzheimer's.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
about genetics, though?

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
What if you are
genetically predisposed

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:90%
to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's?

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.475 align:middle line:84%
Can the telomeres affect
the genetic predisposition?

00:31:56.475 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.585 align:middle line:84%
Well, anything that shows up
more likely when you get older

00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
should be able to reverse,
whether it's by genetics

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.160 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Alzheimer's,
there are genes,

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
particularly a
gene called ApoE 4.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
People that have the ApoE 4 gene
are at higher risk of getting

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I don't

00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

it gets turned on just

I look at it, especially when

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:06.262 align:middle line:84%
you're doing homologous
stem cell-- where you're

00:45:06.262 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
taking cells from your own
body and putting them back

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
into you-- is really a way
of just providing your body

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.200 align:middle line:84%
with cells that
have long telomeres.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking at a way of
just adding longer telomeres

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to the cells you
already have, instead

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:84%
of adding new
cells to your body.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.355 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of where you
are-- you've had cell damage

00:45:26.355 --> 00:45:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and the cells have died,
then, I think, stem

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.720 align:middle line:84%
cells is the only solution
and the best solution

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to do to try to
rejuvenate the tissue.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.435 align:middle line:84%
And that's what, like,
regenerative medicine is all

00:45:36.435 --> 00:45:39.540 align:middle line:84%
about, is trying to
rejuvenate or recreate

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.330 align:middle line:84%

telomeres than brain cells?

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It's all a
function of how many times

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.680 align:middle line:90%
has a cell divided?

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.082 align:middle line:84%
And so some cells-- you know,
I'm going to guess here,

00:46:00.082 --> 00:46:02.540 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't actually
gone and measured these things,

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:84%
but I would imagine that
cells of the heart, nerve

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
cells, those typically have
probably longer telomeres

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.450 align:middle line:90%
because they don't divide.

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:84%
They are terminally
differentiated.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.950 align:middle line:84%
They were created a long time
ago, and they never divide.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the telomeres don't get
shorter, except by other means.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But probably not
as drastically as,

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:22.477 align:middle line:90%
actually, cell division does.

00:46:22.477 --> 00:46:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But now, in the case
of those kind of cells,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll say the nerve
cell, for instance,

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:84%
they need what I call
caregiver cells, OK,

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.600 align:middle line:90%
in order to function.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:84%
They are surrounded
by glia cells.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And one particular one
is called Schwann cells

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that actually produce
a protein called

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.000 align:middle line:84%
myelin that coats
the nerve cells.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And so those cells,
they do divide.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, these glia
and Schwann cells,

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:84%
they do-- a Schwann cells
is a type of glia cell.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.780 align:middle line:90%
They do divide.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.374 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result, their
telomeres do get shorter.

00:46:54.374 --> 00:46:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're
going to find out

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that one of the causes
of a lot of dementia,

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.530 align:middle line:84%
including multiple
sclerosis, things like that,

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.460 align:middle line:84%
are due to the fact that the
Schwann cells quit producing

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:84%
myelin when the
telomeres get shorter.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hoping-- of
course, I keep saying this,

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.260 align:middle line:84%
because we've got a long way
to go on our research-- I'm

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
hoping that we're going to find
out that by keeping telomeres

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.017 align:middle line:84%
long might actually reverse some
of the effects of some diseases

00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
even know about yet,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.932 align:middle line:90%
like multiple sclerosis.

00:47:20.932 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's exactly
what I was referring to.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Now are there--
there are supplements

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:84%
in the market that are--
that prove-- or not prove,

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:32.540 align:middle line:84%
but they claim to thicken
the myelin sheath.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:84%
There is the oyster cell,
or the shark cartilage,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:41.250 align:middle line:90%
or the jelly-- the whatever.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Have you found any of those
to actually be effective?

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:48.145 align:middle line:90%
Jellyfish extract?

00:47:48.145 --> 00:47:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, to
be honest with you,

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I only just learned about those
just now when you told me.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there
were supplements

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:56.460 align:middle line:90%
that would improve--

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.918 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've done
many shows on it.

00:47:57.918 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I'm very
focused on the telomeres.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.556 align:middle line:84%
But boy, I'm going
to do some homework

00:48:03.556 --> 00:48:04.972 align:middle line:84%
and learn about
these supplements.

00:48:04.972 --> 00:48:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should
start taking some.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the anti-aging
industry, even depicted

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.080 align:middle line:84%
in the film, tends to
have a lot of charlatans.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.665 align:middle line:84%
And it also has some
very thin research

00:48:13.665 --> 00:48:15.040 align:middle line:84%
behind some of
these supplements.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.585 align:middle line:84%
But the minute you say the
fountain of youth, people rush.

00:48:17.585 --> 00:48:20.435 align:middle line:84%
It's been that way for--
throughout history,

00:48:20.435 --> 00:48:21.560 align:middle line:90%
throughout ancient history.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Can I make some--
give everybody advice?

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And
that's, to get away

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:84%
from actually listening
to all the charlatans

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.385 align:middle line:84%
and quacks and stuff like
that, and all the propaganda

00:48:33.385 --> 00:48:34.580 align:middle line:90%
and the focus groups.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Marketing.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.038 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Marketing
and stuff like that,

00:48:37.038 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:84%
from telling the wrong
stories, to find out

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.941 align:middle line:84%
what's really going
on, go to PubMed.

00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:42.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.370 align:middle line:90%
P-u-b-m-e-d.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.020 align:middle line:84%
That's a database of
scientifically peer-reviewed

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.620 align:middle line:90%
journal articles.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.228 align:middle line:90%
And look in that.

00:48:50.228 --> 00:48:52.436 align:middle line:84%
And some of them will be
scientific, but some of them

00:48:52.436 --> 00:48:55.370 align:middle line:84%
will be non-scientific enough
for people to understand them.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But actually see what
the studies are really

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:90%
saying about different things.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.744 align:middle line:84%
And so if you find a supplement
that people are claiming

00:49:03.744 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:84%
does this or that,
and you go to PubMed,

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and you can't even find a
study on that supplement,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.290 align:middle line:90%
don't believe it.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.820 align:middle line:90%
The study hasn't been done.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be
published in that journal,

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:15.375 align:middle line:84%
or in that database
of scientifically

00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.674 align:middle line:90%
peer-reviewed journal articles.

00:49:16.674 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if I look
up shark cartilage,

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I could see if there's
any studies there

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.462 align:middle line:84%
that proves that it
grows bone marrow, right?

00:49:23.462 --> 00:49:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And you might find
one that says it doesn't, one

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.461 align:middle line:90%
says it does.

00:49:26.461 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to, like, find a
case of where 10 papers says it

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:90%
does, and one says it doesn't.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Then if you find that,
then believe it, it works.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great advice.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can do our
own research, which

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.104 align:middle line:90%
I think is very empowering.

00:49:38.104 --> 00:49:40.416 align:middle line:90%
And it's pubmed.com.

00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:41.790 align:middle line:90%
That's terrific.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So you two are clearly in
this wonderful honeymoon

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
phase of your
lives, which I love.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the film,
you're so sweet when

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:53.692 align:middle line:84%
you say, I'm going to be married
forever and ever and ever.

00:49:53.692 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Think about that.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Think about that.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Expand on that a
little bit more.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: Well, I just
feel like our relationship

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:90%
is a grand adventure.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just make it that way, so
it's fun and it's interesting.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're always-- I
think we're respectful

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of each other's
individual independence.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We're both really
independent, but it works.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And so it's fun.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Has this movie coming
out changed your lives?

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been on the road

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: It hasn't for me.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:26.910 align:middle line:84%

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:28.350 align:middle line:84%

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERIDAN: Yeah, we

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, busy
with our missions.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.112 align:middle line:84%

00:50:34.112 --> 00:50:35.570 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make a
difference to me,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as far as
a change for us.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- I'm really
excited that it's letting

people know about anti-aging
and the real science.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.124 align:middle line:84%
I always keep saying,
Bill, you need

00:50:46.124 --> 00:50:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to get out in front
of more people

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.040 align:middle line:84%
so they understand
what's happening.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's so important.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.070 align:middle line:84%

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:90%
starting that conversation?

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Has it helped?

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, I
mean, we get a lot

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of people interested
in investing.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's rare when actually
somebody actually gets

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to the point of actually
saying, here's the investment.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But we're at a point
now where I think

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:84%
it's too late to actually
come with investors,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.130 align:middle line:84%
because we've now spent so much
energy into getting products

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to get royalties to
generate our own funding.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.432 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Yeah, I
mean, I don't know

00:51:36.266 --> 00:51:40.604 align:middle line:84%
if you've even thought about the
fact of growing into old age.

00:51:40.604 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I guess we need to get rid
of that conversation now.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But growing into,

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Accellerated years together.

there a point where

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you both want to actually stop
and enjoy what you've done?

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Well, we do.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: We do enjoy.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Yeah.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.483 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: No this is--
I've got the funnest job

00:52:34.483 --> 00:52:35.100 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:35.933 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: Me, too.

00:52:35.933 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel like every day's a joy.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not
work, it's play.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:39.335 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERIDAN: It is.

00:52:39.335 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: It is, yeah.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.616 align:middle line:90%
Very much.

00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was really cute.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
what's next for you,

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:51.079 align:middle line:84%
are you enjoying the
documentary and all the exposure

00:52:51.079 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:90%
it's getting?

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.078 align:middle line:84%
Or is there another
one on the way?

00:52:53.078 --> 00:52:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Or what are you thinking?

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I'm enjoying
it, but I'm actually

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:59.630 align:middle line:84%
getting quite anxious to
get back to the lab bench

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.730 align:middle line:90%
and do some science.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't like--
I'm not a person

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that likes talking about
what I'm going to do.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody that likes
to get the work done.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's just--
it's getting closer.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that by mid-2015, as
I said earlier, we're actually--

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be able to
get my lab coat back on

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.479 align:middle line:84%
and just focus on
all that stuff.

00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:22.895 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody else wants to
come and make a documentary,

00:53:22.895 --> 00:53:25.129 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say, not at home.

00:53:25.129 --> 00:53:25.754 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:53:25.754 --> 00:53:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're gone from the lab,
do have scientists, though,

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that are still
working on testing

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.920 align:middle line:84%
these various different
types of extracts?

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes, I do.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.774 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to get
in there with them.

00:53:36.774 --> 00:53:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Any new discoveries?

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.814 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.814 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I would say
the biggest discoveries

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:84%
we've had have been discoveries
that we've licensed out

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.131 align:middle line:84%
of the company,
because we haven't been

00:53:49.131 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:84%
able to do a lot
research ourselves.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.129 align:middle line:84%
We do some research,
but not enough.

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But we did license one
of our best chemicals

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.430 align:middle line:90%
out to a lab in New Zealand.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And they did some medicinal
chemistry and stuff,

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and proved the potency of
it and the safety of it,

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.374 align:middle line:84%
So that's, I think, the
biggest exciting discovery.

00:54:09.374 --> 00:54:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
the skin cream?

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: That's
the chemical that you

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:13.130 align:middle line:90%
put into the skin cream.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And they did clinical
studies with that.

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing
what they saw.

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And especially with the safety.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Completely safer than
ginger, ginseng, Resveratrol,

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.925 align:middle line:84%
things like that, which
are considered very safe.

00:54:23.925 --> 00:54:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's a topical?

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah,
as a top-- well,

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.422 align:middle line:84%
even when added to human
cells on a Petri dish,

00:54:29.422 --> 00:54:30.630 align:middle line:90%
it would be safer than those.

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was also done on human
skin, and in clinical studies,

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:39.720 align:middle line:84%
where actually 100, I think, 100
women, 50 placebos, 50 tested,

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.650 align:middle line:90%
were actually tested.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was
absolutely no signs

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.770 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of like
negative side effects.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Product B, what's
in the Product B that--

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is it a proprietary
blend of something?

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it several things that
allows the lengthening

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:90%
of the telomeres to be halted?

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:05.362 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I can't really
say that Product B lengthens

00:55:05.362 --> 00:55:07.320 align:middle line:84%
telomeres, because the
clinical studies haven't

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:90%
been completed yet.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.310 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is that it's a
mixture of natural products

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that there's been 37 of
them that we discovered.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.952 align:middle line:90%
And not all 37 are in there.

00:55:19.952 --> 00:55:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I think probably only
the strongest ones.

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.368 align:middle line:84%
But these are natural
products that, when

00:55:23.368 --> 00:55:26.070 align:middle line:84%
we add to human cells
grown in a Petri dish,

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.230 align:middle line:84%
it actually causes the
production of telomerase

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.032 align:middle line:90%
inside those cells.

00:55:30.032 --> 00:55:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward to
the clinical studies being

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.700 align:middle line:84%
completed, which are under
way through Isogenics.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: About how much
longer would those take?

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It can take--
sometimes clinical studies

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.340 align:middle line:84%
take four years or
more, longer to do.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'm hoping that
they'll get done quickly.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a struggle
because the techniques

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of measuring telomere lengths
are still in its infancy, too.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:84%
There's one company that I think
is doing exceptionally well

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.670 align:middle line:84%
at this-- a company called
Life Length in Spain.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trying to do
some of the clinical studies

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:08.960 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's not
an easy thing to do.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.081 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just great
to know that this exists.

00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It give us hope, if
anything, and mostly

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.550 align:middle line:84%
towards living healthier and
reversing a lot of illnesses

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that really cause a
poor quality of life.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.940 align:middle line:90%
So keep doing what you're doing.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
imparting your knowledge.
