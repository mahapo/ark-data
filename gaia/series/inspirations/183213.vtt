00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: What if
you are the change

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:90%
the world is waiting for?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
What if you've been made
wrong your entire life,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and you suddenly
realize that you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:90%
haven't done anything wrong.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You've done, actually,
everything right.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
What if choosing yourself is
what your freedom really is.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the questions
that Dr. Dain Heer asks.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
He is the co-creator of
Access Consciousness.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And after his amazing
book, "Being You,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:10%
Changing the World," Dr.
Dain has a new book out

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:10%
called, "The Return
of the Gentleman,"

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:10%
which is a much
needed conversation

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:10%
for both men and women.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.862 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Thank you
for being here.

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAIN HEER: Ah, Lisa,
thank you for having me.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So great.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was just talking about that
in the beginning of being you,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
really being you, and not
being made wrong for being you.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you give me an example
of what that looks like?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>>HEER: Well, what it looks
like is, when you're being you,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.745 align:middle line:10%
you like the person looking
back at you in the mirror.

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:10%
You realize you have
different points of view

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.572 align:middle line:10%
than other people,
but they're not wrong.

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And other people's points
of view aren't wrong.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They're just their
points of view.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And you start to have a
sense that the possibilities

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that you've always
known should exist

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:90%
can actually come to fruition.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're not living in the
sense anymore of, I'm wrong,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and it'll never work
out, and the future

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:90%
won't be any greater.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You start living
in the sense of,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm actually cooler
than I thought I was.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually not wrong.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.885 align:middle line:10%
But I don't have to make anybody
else wrong to not be wrong.

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:10%
I don't have to try
to prove I'm right.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.222 align:middle line:10%
That all goes away.

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:10%
So the self-judgment
systems that we have

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:10%
start to unravel themselves.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.313 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
have a sense of,

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to create something
different as my future,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and I actually can.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it being made
wrong by society or people,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.693 align:middle line:84%
your family, or what
does that look like?

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
What does that
judgment look like?

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: The answer is yes.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
typical parent.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
They try to show their
child right from wrong

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
as though that's the
job of a parent here.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
My point of view
is, as a parent,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
you're here to show your
children how to be successful

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
in life and how to actually
get a sense that you have value

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and know where the boundaries
are and know when you can push

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
them and when you can't.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So we get the
judgment from the time

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
we're tiny about
what's right and wrong.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we're so aware
that we take that in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:90%
and we use it against us.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
We get it from teachers.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
We get it from friends.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at any
group of teenagers.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
They sit around, most of
them, not all of them,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of them
sit around judging

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%
everyone and everything.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things for me

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is to see teenagers who have
had Access Consciousness

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
classes, when they've been in
the classes their parents have

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
attended for a
couple of years, they

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
don't sit around doing
judgment of everybody else.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.038 align:middle line:84%
They literally sit around
talking about possibilities.

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And they go, we have this
thing going on in our school.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
What can we do to change it?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
That's where they're
being us comes in.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.002 align:middle line:84%
Because if we talk about
being you, people are, like,

00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm awake.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm being me.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, no, you're awake.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You're being all the
stuff that you learned

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
you were supposed to be, not
what you would actually like

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:90%
to be, even, for most people.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It moves you into more
of an activist perspective

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:90%
of what you care about, right?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Absolutely.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And an activist
perspective from the place

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of being active and
creating your life.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.495 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
that, when I wrote "Being You,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Changing the World," there were
a lot of people who were, like,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
but the world is
too big to change.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, I
do understand that.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking about
first is being you and changing

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:90%
this world that is your world.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we
become the inspiration

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
for other people around
us to have this kinder,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
gentler perspective
with ourselves,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
to have more joy with ourselves
to come out of wrongness that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.702 align:middle line:90%
changes the world around us.

00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
interesting, because I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
can see how that judgment
from others and ourselves

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:90%
get locked into our body.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know so
much about the body,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
you're a doctor of
chiropractic medicine.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll call it that.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: We'll call it that.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We'll call it that.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
ability to see where

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:90%
it's also stuck in the body.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So that shows the emotional
and physical connection

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have, from our
thoughts and our feelings

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
getting lodged in
the body is, when

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
you look at someone
in pain in their body,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:90%
what is it that you see?

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, what
I perceive for me

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is I perceive the stuck
energy, if you will.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to make it
sound that generic.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I do
that is because that can

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
come from thousands of things.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what I find is,
where people twist something

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
into a lie in their world, and
then that lie is what sticks,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and the lie is what keeps
it perpetrating itself.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's, like,
for example, if you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
were told, when you were
younger that you're stupid,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
or you're not generous
or something like that.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a lie, OK,
and it's also a judgment.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.975 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have this
judgment that's not true--

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
judgment is never true.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is always a lie,
whether it's right or wrong,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
good or bad.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But that may be a
story for another time.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
this, when somebody's

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
been living with
this, they take it,

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
make it something

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that stays with them
so that they don't have

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
to try to think about
it anymore-- like, OK,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that I'm this way,
and this is bad and wrong.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they do
is they find a way

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to solidify it in their body
so that it can be with them all

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the time, so they know when
they're being bad and wrong.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, what
most people have learned

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is a way of being in
the world is learned

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
when I'm bad and wrong, so I
don't be bad and wrong anymore.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That anchors it.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Yeah, and that's their
sum total of most people's

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
lives is, they know that
they're bad and wrong.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
They just have
this sense of that.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And now their only choice is
to try not to be bad and wrong.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does that
have to do with creation?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
We're never looking
for the possibilities,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
because we're always on
this bad/good right/wrong

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
system of judgment in that
paradigm, which takes us out

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:90%
of being us.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's why
there's depression.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
unhappiness is being

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in that container of judgment
constantly, judging your life,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
judging yourself in your
life, and others around you.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not a win-win.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: It is.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a lose-lose.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.213 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And then, if you
couple that with the fact

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:29.082 align:middle line:84%
that we're all so highly
psychically aware that we pick

00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
up on other people's thoughts,
feelings, and emotions

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and judgments-- like, if
you've ever walked into a, room

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
you were having a good day,
and you walk into a room,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is sad,
and you're, like,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:90%
instantly your body feels sad.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
You get sad.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:90%
You're like, what happened?

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not yours.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
That was what you
just walked into.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But we do it every
moment of our lives,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and nobody's ever
acknowledged it that we do.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.307 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Same thing happens
when change happens.

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You walk into something, and
then it gets thrown at you,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:90%
and there's a change.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And a situation-- change
is never really gradual.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It does tend to happen pretty
fast these days, doesn't it?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: True story,
faster than ever.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Faster than ever.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So how do we deal
with that using

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.622 align:middle line:84%
the tools of Access
Consciousness, which,

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
by the way, is a
huge body of work.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.663 align:middle line:84%
Can I just talk about that for
one sec before we go into that.

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:15.165 align:middle line:84%
You really have-- how long have
you been developing Access.

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, I've been
part of developing it

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:90%
for the last 19 years.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Gary Douglas,
that's the founder,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
started it 30 years ago.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And to say it's a
huge body of work

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
is even an understatement
at this point.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Between all of the access
facilitators in the world,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
we have, I don't know 100
books, maybe a few more.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We've got over
10,000 facilitators.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But we address everything from
relationship, to being you,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to money, to giving energies
you can use with your body.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Every aspect of reality is
really addressed by this.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's called Access
Consciousness for a reason

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
because the only
difficulty-- the only time we

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
create a difficulty in
our lives is when we don't

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.058 align:middle line:90%
function from consciousness.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
When we function
from unconsciousness

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
or anti-consciousness,
that's the only time

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
we create a difficulty
in our lives.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
If we go against our
knowing is one good example.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:90%
We know how well that turns out.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people have been
taught that they don't know,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
so they're living lives that
go against their knowing.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:90%
What we're doing is--

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:84%
our target is to bring
your awareness back to you.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Our tag line is, empowering
people to know that they know.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
about us getting

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to the awareness of
what we truly are,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
but not from a
separationist perspective.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are, like,
I'm going to go live in a cave

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:90%
to find out who I truly am.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.752 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, that's
not going to work.

00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Because once you get
back to your family,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:90%
you're going to forget it all.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.081 align:middle line:84%
You need to find
out, how do you deal

00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
with your family, your life,
this reality, politics,

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.770 align:middle line:84%
your body, your
job, all of-- money?

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you be present in
the face of all of that

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
and not lose you?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So that goes back to
the question of change.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
When those types of things, we
think that they're one way--

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and we've kind of
worked for them

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to be that way,
like you're saying.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
We've really gathered all
of our unconsciousness

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.405 align:middle line:84%
and all of our judgments, and
we've set something the way

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
that we think we need it
to be, like a relationship

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.628 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
way I needed to be.

00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And then it changes.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Damn it.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it hurts.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, or a job.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Well--

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it changes.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: It only
hurts if you have

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
a fixed point of view about
how it was supposed to be.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.942 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can we talk about that?

00:09:20.942 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Yeah, well,
here's the big thing.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.193 align:middle line:84%
Two things, number one is,
when something changes--

00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
in other words, if you're
asking for something

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
different and greater, when that
different in greater shows up,

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
it is always going to
look different than you

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:90%
thought it would, always.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, yeah.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.185 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I mean, if we just take
that in, for a moment, and go,

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:90%
whoa.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, if
you choose something

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
different and greater,
it's going to show up

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
different and greater.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: It's going to show
up different and greater.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And we keep thinking different
must be less and wrong

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't match our
projection and our judgment

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and our expectations.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I found
is, if we are willing to give up

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
our projections, our
expectations, and our judgments

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
of how something is
supposed to look,

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
how it's supposed to show up,
our projections, expectations,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and judgments of ourselves,
our projections, expectations,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and judgments of our partners,
what starts to happen

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is the universe can
give it to us in any way

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have a
point of view limiting it.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
What if someone's doing
something horrible and, like,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
a loved one-- like, I
just talked to someone,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and their ex-husband is
doing something horrible.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at that
as a possibility, Dain?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Well, OK.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have to realize that
started a long time ago.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Why do I say that?

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things I found,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest things
I found that gives people

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of freedom in their
"relationship issues,"

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
if you will, is I
will ask them, OK,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
so did you know this person
was this type of person

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
before you got
together with them?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.263 align:middle line:84%
Every single time,
the answer is yes,

00:10:56.263 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
even when the person wants
to say, no, they weren't.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.575 align:middle line:84%
They took me out for
flowers, and now they

00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
tie me in the basement,
and don't let me out.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
For flowers-- no,
they took me out.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:84%
They gave me flowers and
took me out to a nice dinner,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:90%
how about that?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we know this is
the thing, once again,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
that we've got to get.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can ask somebody
a question like that,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
and they go, oh, my gosh, yes.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I saw the signs.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I saw the signs are one.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But even that is a
disconnection from our knowing.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Like Gary tells
this wonderful story

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:84%
about working with this lady
who, she'd been married for 16

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
years, her husband left
her, and she was devastated,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and nothing he did
was changing it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he was doing a
private session with her.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.298 align:middle line:84%
And they were almost all
the way through the session,

00:11:43.298 --> 00:11:44.657 align:middle line:90%
and nothing could changed.

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we get there,
what we do is, we go,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
there must be a
lie here somewhere.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like people
to have that awareness

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.007 align:middle line:84%
because, if you're trying
to change something,

00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's not changing,
there's a lie there somewhere.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do
is ask the question,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:90%
where's the lie here?

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And what is the lie,
spoken or unspoken?

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.598 align:middle line:84%
If you ask that enough,
what will happen is,

00:12:02.598 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll spot the lie, and
then the whole situation

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:90%
would lighten up.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Because a lie always
makes us heavier.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:84%
What's true for you
always makes you lighter.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:90%
A lie always makes you heavier.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he was working
with this lady,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
devastated after her husband
left and finally said to

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:90%
her, wait a minute.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So because she was
devastated that he left,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
he said to her-- he
got a hit in his head.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her, so when
did you leave the marriage,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
six months before you got
married or six months after?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And she went,
six months before.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.147 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Like, she knew who
this guy was six months before.

00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And he was not a nice guy.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.483 align:middle line:90%
He was a total jerk.

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And Gary said, why did
you go through with it?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, the wedding
invitations were already

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
sent out.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So for $400 of
wedding invitations

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and a bit of embarrassment
with friends and family,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
you stayed with this
person for 16 years--

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 16 years.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: --to try to prove
that you didn't have

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the awareness in the
first place and to try

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to prove that he was
who you decided he was,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:90%
not who you knew he was.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, that can change
an entire perspective.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Entire.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It actually gives
the responsibility back

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to the person for the
choices that they made.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.027 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And not to be wrong.

00:13:11.027 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: That's crucial.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It is not to be wrong.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is the other--

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
we have so many weird things
that go on in this world

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that we all just take for
granted as though it's real.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.583 align:middle line:84%
And so in Access Consciousness,
we take a look at these things

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and go, wait a minute.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:90%
That's heavy.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
That's not contributing
to that person.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:84%
What other possibility
is available?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.957 align:middle line:84%
And you notice I ask
a lot of questions.

00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:31.757 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:31.757 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a good though.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But a question
always opens up

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:90%
other doorways, a possibility.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
An answer always
closes them down.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
A question empowers;
an answer disempowers.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so to the extent that
you can ask questions

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
about something-- but
make it a real question.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Not, I'm asking a question
so I can feel better.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, really,
what else is possible?

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
What's going on here that
I haven't acknowledged?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So with this lady as an
example, what was going on

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.153 align:middle line:84%
was that she knew, and she
went against your knowing.

00:13:58.153 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I say, when
somebody is being terrible,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.037 align:middle line:84%
like with your friend, or
whoever you were talking to,

00:14:04.037 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
it's like, what I would do is I
would get them to acknowledge,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:90%
when did you know?

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And really nail them to
the wall on it, though,

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
because unless they get
where it really happened,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:90%
things aren't going to change.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But this is where-- you know
that statement, the truth

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:90%
shall set you free?

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, I would
say, what is true

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%
for you shall set you free.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.072 align:middle line:84%
And when you can-- and all it
takes is to acknowledge the lie

00:14:26.072 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
because, if we're going
along and everything is cool,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and then things twist out of
control or twist into a yucky

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
place--

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a lie there.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: There's some
lie there, whether it's

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
a lie we bought from
somebody else, something we

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:90%
told ourself, doesn't matter.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So what ended up happening
with this lady is

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
she just went like this,
and opened her mouth,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and opened her eyes, and
she was, like, oh, my god.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And she had freedom
for the first time

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
since her relationship
had broken up.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Freedom, yes.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
That's ultimately
what we're after.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
That whole idea of, what is
true makes you feel lighter is--

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:90%
it's so perfect.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to check it
out here in this video.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You can really see what
Access Consciousness is about.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So what happens in the
room during a Being You class

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:84%
is something I don't even
know if I can explain.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
The closest description
of it I can give,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:90%
really, is kind of like magic.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And is so it's
indescribable because, what

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you see in the room is,
you'll be in a room with 100

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.148 align:middle line:90%
or 200 or 300 other people.

00:15:30.148 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have somebody
get up at the microphone

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
because I have open questions.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.793 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask any question
that's available for you.

00:15:35.793 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have somebody ask
this question about something

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.733 align:middle line:84%
that has been sticking
them their entire life,

00:15:40.733 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the main thing they've
been judging themselves

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%
for their entire lives.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They've had it for sometimes
25 years, sometimes 50 years.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And you see, through
using the Access tools,

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and I facilitate them,
you see this unlock.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:90%
You feel it unlock.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You can see their
face be different.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
You can feel their
body be different.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
their world changes.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And what you recognize is,
if they can do it, so can I.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, multiply that by
a few hundred people.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Multiply that by
some people working

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
on stuff with their
bodies that they

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
let change, some people
with their relationships,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people on
self-esteem and happiness.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And you start to recognize
that the world that you thought

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:84%
was not changeable is
totally malleable if you just

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
have the right tools.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And after you have 20 or 30
people who go (EXPLOSION SOUND)

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:10%
into a whole
different world, then

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:10%
what happens for you
is, you go, I want that.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.038 align:middle line:10%
Why am I stopping
myself from having

00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:10%
it because I need to make
somebody else's point of view

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:10%
right or some point of view I
decided in the past correct?

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that to myself?

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have everything
that's actually possible,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and nothing is standing
in my way anymore.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Bring it on.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is this magic that

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is facilitated by
all of us together,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
coming together in a
room full of people

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
who truly have your back, who
are there for the greatness

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
to choose and what's

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
possible to change and step into
is an experience like no other.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when Access
Consciousness is really created

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:90%
by a group of people doing it--

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and now there are
hundreds of thousands

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.881 align:middle line:84%
of people that really
ask these questions

00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
and make themselves
feel lighter and give

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.256 align:middle line:84%
other people permission
to feel lighter,

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and it really is spread.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I love this because your sister
created a book of your memes.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read some of these
because these are sentences

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that come out of Dain's
mouth that really open up

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
possibilities like he was
talking about, like this one.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It is, "Nobody is
valuable enough

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%
to make yourself wrong for."

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Explain that.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, what we tend
to do is, we tend to make,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
especially the most judgmental
people in our lives,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the meanest people in
our lives, so valuable

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that, if they tell us something
about us that is mean, unkind,

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
or designed to make us
feel wrong, we buy it,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and we believe it.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%

tend to be bosses.

But there's-- see, here's
the interesting thing is,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
if we're not willing
to be made wrong,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
we either change the
situation with the boss,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
or they treat us differently
than they treat everybody else.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Or we go find someplace
else, get another job,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.172 align:middle line:84%
and, oftentimes, become
the boss ourselves.

00:18:21.172 --> 00:18:23.172 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what about
that phrase of, the way

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself is how
others will see you?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you change your value
in order for other people

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:90%
to see that value?

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well you can't change
it in order for other people

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
to see that value, because
that's the same hamster

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
trail that we're
on, the habit trail,

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%
running in the same circle.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel better
about me so you like me more.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm going to feel better
about me so I like me more.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So I like me.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I like me enough,
your point of view about me

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
truly does not matter.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.033 align:middle line:90%
And when I say that--

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
now, but you also
have to realize,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.825 align:middle line:84%
in the world we live in, to have
that point of view, people go,

00:18:57.825 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, that's arrogant.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.982 align:middle line:90%
That's selfish.

00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
No, actually, when you
have that point of view,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
you become kinder.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
You become more humble.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The people who do
arrogance are insecure.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The people who are
selfish are insecure.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize that
the universe provides.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
What this gives you
is the awareness

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that you are part of the
universe, number one, that you

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
have value, number two, and
that everything is provided for,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and that you can ask for
and receive everything.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.993 align:middle line:84%
It's totally different
than what we're

00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
told, pretty much, like
everything else in this world

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.375 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes
so much sense.

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're really
truly valuing yourself,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
other people think.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And to go after your own
personal compassion and caring

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
is really, when you
truly value yourself,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
it comes down to that.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it comes down to
compassion and caring

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and loving and
valuing the world.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: And that, right there--

00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we talked about being
you, changing the world

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I see.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And that's
why I wrote it.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
But that's exactly what it does.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It truly allows you to finally
have that caring for the world

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that you've always had,
but not be destroyed

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
when other people
don't receive it, not

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
be hurt when other people don't
get it in the way that you do,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.385 align:middle line:84%
but to actually have that
caring for you and the world,

00:20:11.385 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:90%
and there's no separation.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This book is, like a--

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it's called,
"Everything Daine says."

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.208 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was created--
tell us, "Memes."

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:90%
How did this get created?

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.917 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, for
those that don't know,

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
a meme is one of those
pictures with words overlaid

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
on the top of it where you can
read it and go, oh, hopefully

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
be inspired or
laugh or something.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:90%
You just get it.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I do these when
I'm facilitating classes.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll say something.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And then I shout out, meme.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I started it just
for the fun of it.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.693 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody started
writing them down and actually

00:20:39.693 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:90%
making memes out of them.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.405 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow,
this is so cool.

00:20:42.405 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, my sister, at
Christmas in 2018,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
gave me a collection
of the ones that she

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
thought were the
coolest from 2018,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.255 align:middle line:90%
from the classes I facilitated.

00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
That-- you can
find out there you

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
know you can find about their
online, Instagram, wherever,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Facebook, wherever people go
to find these things, right?

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.705 align:middle line:84%
And so she put them
together in a book

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and gave them to
me at Christmas,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:90%
so that's why we have the book.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.753 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's so beautiful.

00:21:04.753 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Isn't it great?

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.232 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: That's my sister.

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:09.735 align:middle line:84%
That is how much I'm
cared for by my sister.

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And well, that's
one example, yes.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This one is, "The
choice you make today changes

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
the future you have tomorrow--

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.873 align:middle line:84%
or it creates the future
you have tomorrow."

00:21:20.873 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
"The choice you
make today creates

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:90%
the future you have tomorrow."

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's true because I've
been through this experience

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
where I realized that
complaining is only because I'm

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.638 align:middle line:84%
not in agreement with
the choice I made.

00:21:34.638 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
When I'm complaining
about something,

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I realize, well, if I really
truly choose to do something,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
then I can't possibly
complain about it.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It can never be a burden.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:90%
If I'm all in--

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Right.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.797 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the things that
I was complaining about,

00:21:47.797 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at, oh,
I'm the victim of,

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
or I didn't choose that,
that was chosen for me.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, if you really look at it--

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
like, say your child
is being a problem.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.642 align:middle line:90%
Well, you chose to be a mother.

00:21:58.642 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: You chose to be
a mother, that is true.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And you chose to parent them
in a particular way too.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.483 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we realize
that our choice creates,

00:22:06.483 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
this gives us a totally
different perspective.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, you
complain when you want--

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
you end up complaining
when you're not

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
happy with the
outcome, but usually

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:84%
when you have a projection
and expectation and a judgment

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
about what that outcome
is supposed to be.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to
that old thing again.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But if we would get away
from, undo our projections,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
expectations, and judgments,
of everyone and everything,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
including our
choices and including

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:84%
how it's going to
turn out, then we

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:90%
have nothing to complain about.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that thing about
receiving it even greater--

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.145 align:middle line:84%
because we don't say, universe
it has to show up this way,

00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not receiving
it, you say,

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I would like this or greater.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Universe, get to work.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what if
you ask for something,

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and the universe doesn't
give it to you the way

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted it?

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.042 align:middle line:90%
It's like a shorter--

00:22:53.042 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
universe, or I would like to
show this to show up this way.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
We really get-- well,
we're taught this.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to pray
for what we want,

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.987 align:middle line:84%
and to have an image
and visualize, and--

00:23:01.987 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, let's
look at let's look

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:90%
at that for just a moment.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.072 align:middle line:84%
So we have prayer, which is
to try to put it out there,

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:90%
specifically, to a higher power.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's got its
own interesting point

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:90%
of view attached to it.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
visualization as an example--

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people who
do any sort of spiritual, even

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
psychological, anything can
relate to visualization.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:90%
You cannot see the future.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
You can only perceive
it energetically.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
The future is not solid
enough to be seen.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The present is; we're
here right now having it.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:90%
The past is.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
We can feel it, and
we can get the visuals

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:90%
and the images of that.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But when we try to visualize
to create a future,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
we are severely limiting
the future that can show up.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, if it doesn't match
our vision, what ends up

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
happening is we don't allow
ourselves to receive it,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
even if it's right
here in front of us,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's dressed in
green instead of blue.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, true.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, what do you then
perceive, the feeling of it?

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Oh, sort of.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the sense of it, and
it goes beyond feeling.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.912 align:middle line:84%
Because feeling narrows
it into a band, which--

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and if you need to go with
the feeling of it for now,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:90%
go for that.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But your sense includes your
perceiving, your knowing,

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
your ability to receive.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.608 align:middle line:84%
And notice, even when I say
it, you notice you get lighter,

00:24:19.608 --> 00:24:21.358 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's opener,
yeah, it's more open.

00:24:21.358 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And that's where we want
to be in creating everything,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
it in the creation

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:90%
of our future right now.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.767 align:middle line:84%
Can we do something
for everybody?

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:29.567 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: OK, awesome, cool.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I get excited.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So rather than try
to see the future--

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.285 align:middle line:84%
so everybody--
you don't have to.

00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:39.035 align:middle line:84%
But everybody out there
who's watching me,

00:24:39.035 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:90%
may want to close your eyes.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.927 align:middle line:84%
And then what I to ask you
to do is just get the sense--

00:24:42.927 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to do
this somewhat quickly.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
You can do it more
in depth later.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like you to get
the sense of waking up

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:84%
in the mornings, most
mornings of your life,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
with this sense of
gratitude for being alive,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
a sense of gratitude
for you, as a being,

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of connection
with all other beings

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and a
sense of not having any fight

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
against those that
don't choose it

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:84%
nor any need to
ever change them.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, get the sense
of actually having

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:84%
this space of being
contributed to

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
by everything around you
that's willing to contribute.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.113 align:middle line:84%
Call it the universe, call
it god, call it spirit,

00:25:20.113 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:90%
call it whatever you want to.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's look at the
money thing, the thing

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that people try to
change most of all,

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and they try to prove they're
not trying to change it.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, here's the way
I'd like you to do.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
What amount of-- get the
sense of having whatever money

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
it requires.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.068 align:middle line:84%
Don't even try to
label the amount.

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But get the sense of the energy
of having the money that would

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
make your life total ease.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Where you could pay all your
bills with no problem, where

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.890 align:middle line:90%
you-- and don't get the how.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.345 align:middle line:90%
This is not a place for how.

00:25:48.345 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:90%
How kills it.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
OK-- and where money has
a sense of ease for you.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Where it's, like, you can
travel if you want to.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can change houses
and upgrade if you want to,

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:84%
or you can fix up the
one that you're in.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You drive a nice
car that you like.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Just get the sense of that
ease being in your world.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, with your
relationships, get a sense

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of actually having people
in your life that contribute

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
to you, that care for you, that
actually have your back, that

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
are there for you when you
need it, and that actually

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
see you as even greater than
you're willing to see yourself,

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and they're willing to tell you.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.678 align:middle line:84%
Now, also get the sense
of the relationships

00:26:26.678 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
you have right now that
you want to change.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Just get the sense of
them changing, like,

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.123 align:middle line:90%
being able to either--

00:26:33.123 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:84%
if it's not changeable
into something greater,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the relationship moves
on to something else,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and you move on
to something else?

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Or they and you change
to where you actually

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of connection
with each other.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.608 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you
to get the sense of all

00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is your future.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But don't look for when
it's going to occur

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
or that it all occurs at the
same time or how it occurs.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And just acknowledge, hey,
universe, consciousness,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking for this.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And I will do and
be anything-- and I

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
will do and be and
change anything

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I need to do and be and
change to have this occur.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, I will allow
myself to have anything.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I will allow myself to
lose anyone or anything.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.813 align:middle line:84%
I will allow myself to
gain anyone or anything.

00:27:15.813 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking now-- and
this acknowledgment

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
is to you that you're asking
and then the acknowledgment

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to the universe that
you're asking too.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.725 align:middle line:90%
But we are part of the universe.

00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:90%
We always forget that part.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We're like, oh, I've
been asking the universe.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are part
of the universe.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.477 align:middle line:90%
So this, now here's--

00:27:33.477 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I know, probably,
for a lot of people,

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
it was a little
spacious, and they're

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
like no, I need to define it.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I know you specifically
need not to define it.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the other gift that
doing it this way gives you.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can refine it more in
a specific area if you want to.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have that
exercise in the "Being You,

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:90%
changing the World Book."

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can refine it more
specifically if you want to.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But here's the one of the
biggest gifts of this.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have wanted to
create a different future,

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know what
to choose in the day

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to day of our
lives to get there.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do is
acknowledge that energy

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and recognize you want
to choose anything

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
that feels like that energy.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So if a new outfit feels
like that energy, buy it.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
If, I don't know,
coming to a Gaiam TV

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.388 align:middle line:84%
to do an interview feels
like that energy, do it.

00:28:18.388 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
If starting a new relationship
feels like that energy, do it.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a choice between
two jobs or two people

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to date, and one feels
more like that energy,

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that's the one you
want to go with.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And if none of them
feel like that energy,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:90%
don't do any of them.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an energy that
will guide you to your future.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
interesting to me is--

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.993 align:middle line:90%
for me, this is so practical.

00:28:37.993 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when we
start to talk about energy,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
are, like, energy and--

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:90%
No, we are energetic beings.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything about us is energetic
and living on this planet.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
a very practical way

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to create a totally different
future that eliminates

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
the how that sticks most of us.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't know the how.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:90%
The universe will show you how.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:90%
You just have to let it.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We don't know how.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
If you really experience that,
in the body, in this time,

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
in this place, rather than in
that place of super expanded

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:90%
spaciousness.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.415 align:middle line:84%
That's great, but it also has
to happen in your day to day.

00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes, exactly.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The day to day.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That was beautiful and
empowering in a graceful way.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I love what you
said about being--

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:84%
we are the universe,
rather than looking

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.240 align:middle line:84%
outside for the
universe to help us.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
We are the universe,
which is allowing

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:90%
us to fit in, to be us.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.938 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking earlier
about being the gentleman

00:29:36.938 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and being the
gentleman that you are.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And this level of
inclusion is what

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
you were about in
terms of men and women.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk-- we've
experienced this MeToo Movement,

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
we have experienced our
voices being heard and still

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:90%
being heard.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more to go,
and a lot more to be heard.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But also, we need
to also #NowWhat?

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing
with the conversation?

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Who are we now?

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
How do we relate to each other?

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:90%
What is consent?

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
What's the conversation now?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, there are so many
aspects to it, as you know,

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%
as I know.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things I want to
point out, with consciousness--

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:10%
you know we talked
about unconsciousness

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:10%
and anti-consciousness or
what create the difficulties.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, this area has
been experiencing

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:90%
more consciousness.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, its coming
out of the dark.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer being hidden.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But we need to take
another crucial step,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:90%
just like you said, #NowWhat?

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people have used

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:84%
this to further
their point of view

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:90%
that men are wrong, for example.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:84%
They already had
that point of view.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
just, see, I knew it.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Look what all these
men are doing.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And some men are
doing horrible things.

00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And so are a lot of women.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I say that,
that's not a defense of men.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's really make
this one clear, OK?

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if I say that as
a man, after we've just

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
mentioned the words
MeToo, then I'm

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
now an evil male
who doesn't get it.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.710 align:middle line:84%
No, what I'm trying
to do-- let me

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you my point of
view, as a man, and all the men

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:90%
that I know personally.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:84%
We are as outraged by what
created the MeToo Movement

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
as the women are and, in
some ways, even more so

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
because this is being
done in our name as men

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:90%
as though this is how men are.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.130 align:middle line:90%
No, no, this is not how we are.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that is
not my kind of man.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.773 align:middle line:90%
I am not that kind of man.

00:31:29.773 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to have a
different conversation that

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
actually acknowledges how men
that desire to be different

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
can be and how they can
actually contribute to women

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and how they don't have
to be a SNAG or a doormat

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:90%
to make that happen.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.427 align:middle line:84%
When I say SNAG, I mean
Sensitive New Age Guy.

00:31:46.427 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, those guys who are way
more sensitive than the women

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that they're with, who are--

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.652 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to be-- so we
don't have to be the doormat.

00:31:56.652 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be the SNAG.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to try
to be the alpha male.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
What we need to realize is,
we have a level of kindness.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We have a level of caring.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But we have a level of
potency that that is.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen to be a
straight man, for example,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
whenever you were a kid and
showed too much kindness or too

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:84%
much softness or too
much sensitivity,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:84%
friends who weren't
really friends,

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.070 align:middle line:84%
but other guys, other kids even
at a young age would be, like,

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:90%
you're gay.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, no,
I'm actually not.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So we've never actually had a
conversation that acknowledges

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:90%
that men have sensitivity also.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Men have caring also.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Men have kindness also.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And they have strength.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a strength in
that sensitivity, that caring,

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and that kindness.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
desire to contribute

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
to women and the willingness
to if we would be allowed to.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so interesting
because what you just

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
described, you just described
a woman, today's woman.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You described kind and loving
and caring and compassionate

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and sensitive and potent
and strong and able

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
to be ourselves and
able to be equal.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Isn't that interesting?

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.058 align:middle line:84%
What I really just
described was a being.

00:33:03.058 --> 00:33:03.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, you did.

00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I described a person.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.168 align:middle line:90%
And this artificial idea that--

00:33:08.168 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of men and women.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.002 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: --men are this,
and women are this.

00:33:11.002 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
No, we are beings
on this planet.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.753 align:middle line:90%
Some of us have indoor plumbing.

00:33:13.753 --> 00:33:16.462 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have
outdoor plumbing.

00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:90%
We have different body types.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
But we have to realize
that it's exactly that.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:90%
We are all people here.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we can show that kindness
and loving and compassion

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
for each other and
strength and support

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:84%
each other's
greatness, then that

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:84%
becomes an equal partnership
that isn't shadowed by,

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, he touched me, or I
touched him, or she touched me.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And it gets so confusing
when the physical happens.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:90%
So explain that.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, one
of the things--

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the difficulties
in the MeToo Movement

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
is, you had to do this
in order to get this.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I am the one
standing in front of you.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one standing
between you and your career.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
That is inappropriate when
anybody does that to anyone.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I do-- once again,
I do acknowledge

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
that there are some horrendous
men doing horrendous things.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
make that clear.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking
about is this idea

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.422 align:middle line:84%
of us actually getting to
have the conversation that

00:34:19.422 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:84%
allows men to be
the gift they are,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:90%
women to be the gift they are.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about this touching,

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
intimacy, where it gets to
that place, what we need to do

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
is acknowledge our awareness.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Why do I say that?

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.102 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just like
the lady that got married,

00:34:35.102 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and knew before she got
married, the guy was a jerk.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were going
to go out with somebody,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.610 align:middle line:84%
you need to know and
be in your knowing,

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:84%
if it feels heavy
for you, don't do it,

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much
they want you to.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to start looking
out for ourselves

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and having our own
backs in the situation.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.864 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: OK, So that's
first, and that is vital.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't get that,
none of the rest of it matters.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we will put
ourselves in situations.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.920 align:middle line:84%
We will end up feeling like
the victim of that situation.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we will go on
believing we are victims.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:90%
But who victimized us?

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a sense, we did by
not following our knowing.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
let's look at-- this

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:90%
is a huge conversation.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.887 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up for sec.

00:35:18.887 --> 00:35:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So in that place of the
victimization-- so the person,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.460 align:middle line:84%
the perpetrator could be very
persuasive or manipulative,

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and I know people that have
been in that situation.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So where would she be not
be the victim in that?

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Where would she take the
responsibility, I'm curious?

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, let me give you
a totally different scenario

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:90%
of the same situation.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, just for
a moment, that she

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:84%
functioned from total awareness,
that she was in total question.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Could anybody manipulate her?

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking of a friend.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.590 align:middle line:90%
She's in college.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And this boy really
got a hold of her.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And now it became--

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:84%
stalked her, and she
had to get a restraining

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.897 align:middle line:84%
order, and the parents, and
all the police involved.

00:36:01.897 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It became-- and
she said I can feel

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
where I made certain mistakes
or was too vulnerable

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:90%
or didn't see this coming.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I would
love to say to her is,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
don't judge yourself for that,
which is what you would say,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, that
would be part of it.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it's like you
have this whole bag of Access

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
tools that are beyond
the ability to describe

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:90%
in the time we have together.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I've dealt with
this with many women

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.780 align:middle line:90%
and also many men.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why, when
I talk about this,

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm, like, we've got
to include both of us.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Because looking at men as
though they're the problem

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
or that all men are wrong,
no, these type of people

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:90%
are the problem.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, sick individuals.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Yes, It's
not men or women

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that are the problem
it's these type of people

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.990 align:middle line:90%
that are the problem.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
it's, like, so when you--

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely talk to
her about judging herself.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But what I would also do is go
further and undo the judgments

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:90%
that she has of her.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.015 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one
thing to tell somebody

00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:90%
not to judge themselves.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
things that I would

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:90%
do using the Access tools.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we would go in,
and I would find out

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:90%
what her judgments were.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.202 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
hidden judgments

00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
kill us the most.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Ones we don't even
realize, because they

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.183 align:middle line:90%
don't go through our head.

00:37:21.183 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:90%
They're energetic.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.958 align:middle line:84%
And I would help her
release those first.

00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
have a conversation.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd go, OK, so tell me
what's really going on here.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
her walk me back.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would go, OK,
and I would ever

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.315 align:middle line:84%
walk me back to where
she was going along,

00:37:35.315 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and this person
entered her life.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go, what was
your awareness on that?

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because you're wrong
for not following it,

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but because, if you acknowledge
you had awareness and didn't

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:84%
follow it, and it
doesn't turn out well,

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:84%
you will make sure to
follow it next time

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.860 align:middle line:90%
and in every other situation.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
also looking at is--

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to look
back, and we tend to get

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.445 align:middle line:90%
stuck in the trauma.

00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:84%
What I'm looking
at is, how do we

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
create a different
future for this person?

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
How do we create a
future where that's

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
no longer occurring for them,
no longer reality for them?

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm also looking to get
them out of the trauma.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have this thing called
Access Consciousness bars

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that we found can literally undo
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And I mean literally,
as in gone.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's an
energetic process,

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:90%
which is just phenomenal.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you about that place
where we do abandon ourselves

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.280 align:middle line:90%
or we do abandon our intuition.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And it does scream at us and
tells us, but we override it.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
over-- that moment.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we repeat
things, and we do the same thing

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.350 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, and we
don't learn from our mistakes

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:84%
because we abandon
that moment where

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.270 align:middle line:84%
our intuition, or our
guidance, our inner self says,

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
don't do that, or this
is going to get you in

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Trouble.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Or there's not going to be
a pleasant consequence here.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:90%
We just ignore it.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.325 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we need to learn.

00:38:52.325 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:90%
How can we--

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Why the
heck do we do that?

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So how can we grab a hold of
that moment of our intuition

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And listen?

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Strangely, probably
the easiest way to do it,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:84%
or if somebody is
willing to do it is they

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.380 align:middle line:84%
can, either do present time, or
they can go back to the past.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we have total
recall of the past,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.120 align:middle line:84%
if we're willing to have
it, if we ask for it,

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:90%
we have a total recall.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we could go
back to that moment

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
where we knew, that moment
where we knew and didn't follow

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that knowing and undo all of the
points of view we have that led

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to us not following or
knowing, what happens now

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.183 align:middle line:84%
is that any energy
that's similar that

00:39:36.183 --> 00:39:37.600 align:middle line:84%
comes into our
world, we're, like,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.808 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, I've seen you before.

00:39:38.808 --> 00:39:40.482 align:middle line:84%
Uh-uh, I'm not going
to do that again.

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to realize
that, since we were kids,

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.652 align:middle line:84%
we were taught to cut
off our awareness.

00:39:44.652 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
were a little kid,

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and you were aware of something
that your mom didn't want

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
you to be aware of,
how wrong did she

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.520 align:middle line:84%
make you so you weren't aware
of what was going on for her?

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And how you know mom
and dad and teachers--

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and so we're taught
that we can't know.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.693 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's how it appears.

00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, this
is one of the biggest

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
destructions of our
awareness is we're

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.838 align:middle line:84%
taught from a very young
age that you can't know,

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and you have to learn it.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.463 align:middle line:84%
And then you regurgitate
the learning,

00:40:10.463 --> 00:40:11.968 align:middle line:90%
which proves you're smart.

00:40:11.968 --> 00:40:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And there's also peer pressure.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:84%
When you're saying, oh,
well, I can't be different.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I can't do this because I
need to desperately fit in

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
so that I don't stand out so
nobody would recognize me,

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.420 align:middle line:90%
because that's death.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.415 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these
things that happen.

00:40:21.415 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, exactly.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So we just desperately
try to fit in,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and we abandon ourselves
again, from a very early age

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to fit in.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.868 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Which is why
I say one more time,

00:40:30.868 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
what I see it with the kids
who come to Access classes,

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.550 align:middle line:84%
their parents don't
do that to them.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
The kid wants something
or wants to do something

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.910 align:middle line:84%
or wants clarity on something,
and the parent goes,

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:90%
what do you know?

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, they'll help them
come to their awareness,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:90%
but they go, what do you know?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.112 align:middle line:84%
And the kid goes, oh, yeah,
it's not going to work out.

00:40:50.112 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, I don't want to
go play with them.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
it's that fast, though.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But we think it's got to be
this big significance because we

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
have we have gone against
our knowing for so many years

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.682 align:middle line:90%
that it's so hardwired in us.

00:41:01.682 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we would let
go of the hardwiring,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.700 align:middle line:84%
things would start to get
spacious a lot more quickly.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But we can also look
and go, well, I'm

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:84%
grateful I got the
awareness today.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.705 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad I watched that show
because I got the awareness.

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:14.943 align:middle line:90%
OK, now what can I do?

00:41:14.943 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
you want to ask yourself

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is, what is it I
know that I haven't

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged about any
situation you have going on?

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Any one that's not so good
you want to change it,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.790 align:middle line:84%
any one that you
want to make better,

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.873 align:middle line:84%
what is it I know that I
haven't acknowledged that

00:41:29.873 --> 00:41:31.230 align:middle line:90%
would change this?

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have this terrible
question in Access,

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.967 align:middle line:84%
how does it get any
better than this?

00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Which is something you want to
ask when something good happens

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.810 align:middle line:90%
or when something bad happens.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.227 align:middle line:84%
That, again, is a
question, but it

00:41:41.227 --> 00:41:44.260 align:middle line:84%
keeps things getting better
and better and better.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you just had a situation
like the girl in college

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
you experience saying, how does
it get any better than this?

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring
out the big guns.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.878 align:middle line:84%
How does it get
any better and this

00:41:52.878 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:84%
is great for the stuff
of life that occurs.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:84%
That's not necessarily
going to work

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.053 align:middle line:84%
very well on this major trauma
that she's experiencing.

00:42:02.053 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I also
want people to know

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is, there are tools
for changing this.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We have research for 30
years, the stuff that

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:84%
goes on in this reality,
the dramas people

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
experience, the traumas, the
sadnesses, the sufferings,

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and found tools to change
a huge amount of it.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, for
me, it's, like, I love

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:90%
what I get to do in the world.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Because I suffer.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I experienced tremendous
abuse when I was a kid.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I experienced dynamic
physical abuse,

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:84%
having my naked body
beaten with belts.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I experienced emotional abuse.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I experienced molestation.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting-- and
we have had this conversation

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:90%
about the MeToo Movement--

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.692 align:middle line:84%
the people that were
beating me were women.

00:42:49.692 --> 00:42:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a circle of women
standing over me, beating me

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.942 align:middle line:84%
with belts, hitting me in
the penis as many times

00:42:53.942 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:84%
as they could because
they wanted to let

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:90%
me know how terrible men were.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Now, what's
interesting about that

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.365 align:middle line:84%
is, I didn't come out
of it hating women.

00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come out of
it hating anybody.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I always knew it could
be different than that.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh, really, you knew.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.768 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Yeah, and it's part
of what drives me forward

00:43:09.768 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to this day with, I know
it can be different,

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and I know this stuff
goes on in the world.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And people will hear me
talk, and they go, well,

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't understand us.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm, like, no, I
really, really do.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I heard it from the
time I was a little kid.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I really, really do.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be
where we get in victim mode

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.343 align:middle line:90%
and try to fight against things.

00:43:28.343 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
fight against it.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.202 align:middle line:84%
We have to get in touch
with us to such a degree

00:43:32.202 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that we will, number
one, never let

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it happen to us
again, number two,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
not perpetrate the
cycle on anybody else,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.662 align:middle line:84%
and number three realize that,
if you've experienced something

00:43:40.662 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:84%
like that, and you're still
putting one foot in front

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of the other, and you are
continuing to move and look

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:84%
for change and
possibilities, you

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:84%
have far more courage
and far more strength

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.893 align:middle line:90%
than you ever imagined possible.

00:43:51.893 --> 00:43:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
amazing example.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for sharing that.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's truly, you were not
at the responsibility or choice

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:90%
of that whatsoever.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:90%
That was something done to you.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you do choose to have
this amazing life now.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.277 align:middle line:84%
And to have, not just an
amazing life because you

00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:90%
travel all over the world.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:90%
You have freedom in your body.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:90%
You have freedom in your soul.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And you represent that for
other people by being you.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Thank you.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And knowing more of
what you've been through--

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.193 align:middle line:84%
and it brings me to tears to
know you went through that.

00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But to be who you are, it's
so beautiful to be who you are

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and to represent who
you are to other people

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and not have to even
fall into that victim

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
or having to dumb yourself down
or be someone who you're not.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Thank you.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's mutual.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: So much.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's mutual.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I have to say, I--

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.140 align:middle line:84%
am now at the place, and
have been for many years

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:84%
at the place, where that isn't
something that affects me.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And not only does it not
affect me, but, as you say,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.655 align:middle line:84%
I'm really blessed to
have the life that I have.

00:44:58.655 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look what you do, yeah.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.542 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But I also
want to say, there

00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
were a there was a lot of
effect that I had from that

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of my life, which
is also why I'm so driven.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm, like, guys,
we can change this.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to live this way.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to live in
that, all of that stuff.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I know it personally very well.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to live that way.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got to a
place 19 years ago

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.510 align:middle line:84%
where I was literally
going to end my life.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.650 align:middle line:90%
You know that part.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was part of the thing
that was underneath the surface

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.900 align:middle line:90%
that I could never get to.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
exploring this area

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:84%
in Access Consciousness 19
years ago when I first met Gary.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And it came up about
what had happened.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
having these tools

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:84%
that we use to
give people freedom

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
from this area of
abuse for years

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and to see their worlds
changed to where they actually

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.040 align:middle line:90%
get the freedom.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:84%
They actually get the beauty
of them as a being, as a soul,

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:90%
as a bright light in the world.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It's truly the greatest gift
I have ever experienced.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My challenge, as
someone interviewing you

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is to put into words the tools
that you have because they're

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.750 align:middle line:90%
vast, and they're experiential.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to
do is I want you to--

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw
at you some myths.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to use
the tools of Access

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and your knowledge to
myth-bust these memes.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.260 align:middle line:90%
These are not Dain memes.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:90%
These are other memes.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, our world is
so chaotic right now.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.880 align:middle line:90%
I say that a lot.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, what do you think of that?

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Now, here's the thing.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.350 align:middle line:84%
What's very strange about
it is, chaos is actually

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.790 align:middle line:90%
where the freedom is.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Chaos is actually when
you're not judging.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Chaos is when you're not
trying to make things linear.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is,
our world is going

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.620 align:middle line:84%
through a massive
reorganization,

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:84%
so it can become the
chaos of possibilities

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that's actually available.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you look at--

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you can look at many
political situations

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.908 align:middle line:84%
in the world, for
example, and think

00:46:51.908 --> 00:46:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the world is going to
hell in a handbasket,

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's all falling apart
because it's chaotic.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.190 align:middle line:84%
No, it's actually
breaking up the order

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that has been here for so
long, the political order,

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the financial order,
all kinds of orders.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.620 align:middle line:84%
by the way, when I talk
about these orders.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I think they mean it a
little differently than I do.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.677 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, but it's true.

00:47:09.677 --> 00:47:12.920 align:middle line:84%
It's every system is breaking
down and breaking through.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.705 align:middle line:84%
Banking and real estate
and financial and education

00:47:16.705 --> 00:47:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and political, everything
is breaking through.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to break
down first, though.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
part about this

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:27.148 align:middle line:84%
is we tend to look at that
as though it's a bad thing.

00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:29.690 align:middle line:84%
But if we get that there's an
underlying inherent chaos, that

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.210 align:middle line:84%
actually is consciousness,
that is actually

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
doing that to create the
choice, at least, if we choose.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It's our choice,
collectively, on the planet.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.310 align:middle line:84%
If we choose to create
greater possibilities,

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:41.810 align:middle line:84%
then that choice
is available to us.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But remember, your point
of view creates a reality.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't create
your point of view.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we have the point of
view that it's destructive,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.660 align:middle line:84%
that's what shows
up in our life.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.868 align:middle line:84%
If we have a point of view
that it's going to go bad,

00:47:52.868 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that's what shows up.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I also
say, ask questions.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:90%
What else is possible here?

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What's right about
this I'm not getting?

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.540 align:middle line:84%
What is it going to
take to change this?

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:84%
How can I use this
to my advantage?

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:84%
What can I be to
create a greater world?

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.020 align:middle line:84%
What can I do here to
have an effect that's

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.790 align:middle line:90%
the world I would like to see?

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Just a few questions.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I have those on a
card and keep it with myself.

00:48:13.445 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes, please, absolutely.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
awesome questions.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.028 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's another one.

00:48:17.028 --> 00:48:19.660 align:middle line:84%
When I get older, I
become irrelevant.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Oh, goodness.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.075 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you about
my friend Gary who is--

00:48:23.075 --> 00:48:23.875 align:middle line:90%
how old am I?

00:48:23.875 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm 29.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:90%
So he's, what?

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:90%
What, did you hear people?

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, Let's see, I'm 40,
something like that,

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:84%
he's 78, 77, 78,
somewhere in that range.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Age is kind of irrelevant to me.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Here's a man who
is still working

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.320 align:middle line:90%
28 days out of the month.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.300 align:middle line:90%
He works 10 to 12 hours a day.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:84%
He travels dynamically,
several weeks out of the month.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And he is part of
creating a movement.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say the head--

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're partners,
but it takes a village,

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.272 align:middle line:90%
but he's the guy.

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.480 align:middle line:90%
We always go to him for help.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We always go to him for
contribution, assistance,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.880 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.307 align:middle line:90%
Highly not relevant-- why?

00:49:06.307 --> 00:49:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Because his point of view
is not when I get older,

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:09.330 align:middle line:90%
I get irrelevant.

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is one where it is
really really, really true.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Your point of view
creates your reality.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot
of older people who

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:84%
are such a contribution to
other people in their lives,

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:84%
whatever sphere of influence,
their family, businesses,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:84%
church groups, get-together
groups, all this sort of stuff.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.730 align:middle line:84%
This is one where we need
to change the point of view.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:90%
All right, here's another one.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Change is difficult.
Change is hard.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We only hold that in place
so we don't make change

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:84%
as fast as we know it
could be because we're not

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:84%
willing to be out of
control enough and our lives

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:47.577 align:middle line:90%
be easy enough.

00:49:47.577 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Because then we would
be so different,

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.452 align:middle line:84%
people would think we had
grown three heads and a tail,

00:49:51.452 --> 00:49:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't want
to talk to us anymore.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.247 align:middle line:84%
So we don't let change occur
as easily and as quickly

00:49:56.247 --> 00:49:58.580 align:middle line:84%
as it could, because we don't
want to be that different,

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to
have things be that easy.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or out of control.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Or out of control.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.957 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
other thing that we

00:50:03.957 --> 00:50:06.590 align:middle line:84%
do is, we keep our
universe the size

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that we, alone, can
control so that it

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:13.670 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get so big that all the
universe can contribute to us.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's safe in there.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's safer--

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Oh, yeah, it's safe
in a prison cell with nobody

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.860 align:middle line:90%
else around too.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:25.580 align:middle line:84%
It's safe in a cave with--
but it's not very much fun.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to have the
changes that we're asking for,

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.520 align:middle line:84%
we need to recognize that it
truly could come with these.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.440 align:middle line:84%
We have a thing in
Access that we say.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We call it the mantra of Access
because we don't know what else

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.470 align:middle line:90%
to call it.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.540 align:middle line:84%
All of life comes to me
with ease and joy and glory.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you would say that 10
times in the morning, 10 times

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:44.677 align:middle line:84%
in the evening, you'll
start to see more

00:50:44.677 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:90%
you show up in your life.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.757 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it works.

00:50:47.757 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it works.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I just know that it works.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.940 align:middle line:84%
All of life comes to me with
these and joy and glory,

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.970 align:middle line:90%
including change.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.610 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:59.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to
start to loosen up the cog.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.160 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So what about, it's true that we
should live happily ever after.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Wouldn't
it be wonderful?

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That is a myth of magnat--

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.270 align:middle line:90%
busted.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I say busted.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:18.335 align:middle line:84%
And look, obviously, that
comes from fairy tales, right?

00:51:18.335 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it be wonderful
if that were the case,

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.080 align:middle line:90%
we lived happily ever after?

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But what that, as so many
things in the world we live in

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:84%
tell us is, you want
to get somewhere,

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't
have to choose again.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the place
where I have $1 billion,

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.410 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to ever choose
again, and I'll just be happy.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the
American dream--

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.650 align:middle line:90%
job, retire, yeah.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Yeah,
except for everybody

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that has ever gotten
where they wanted to get,

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.460 align:middle line:84%
within about three
months, they're bored.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
recognize happily

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:84%
ever after is not only a
myth, it's a destructive myth

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.820 align:middle line:90%
if we're seeking that.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.642 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, though,
I mean, from the point of view

00:51:53.642 --> 00:51:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of, I'm going to
get this, and it's

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.670 align:middle line:84%
going to make me
happy ever after.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like money.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
this amount of money.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
this relationship.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.777 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have the
perfect child, whatever.

00:52:02.777 --> 00:52:07.030 align:middle line:84%
See, for me, I am living
happily continuously,

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:09.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's a choice
every 10 seconds.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And things don't always
go right for you, obviously.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: No.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
about all of life

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.370 align:middle line:84%
comes to me with ease
and joy and glory.

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not only good
things happen to me.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.147 align:middle line:84%
Only good things happen
to me, and that way, I

00:52:19.147 --> 00:52:20.470 align:middle line:90%
can have ease and joy.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And glory is exuberant
expression in abundance,

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:23.647 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:52:23.647 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's not because
only good things happen.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, when
the crap happens too,

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.420 align:middle line:90%
it shows up with ease.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Like our house got flooded
in Hurricane Harvey.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:84%
We live in Houston,
live on the bayou.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:35.770 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 feet of water
in my room and in then

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
the entire first
floor of the house.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.075 align:middle line:84%
We had to pull out 3,500
square feet of flooring.

00:52:40.075 --> 00:52:41.200 align:middle line:90%
We had to replace cabinets.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:84%
We had to cut
drywall up to 4 feet.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We had to replace the
whole thing downstairs.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But it occurred with
this amazing ease.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:52.778 align:middle line:84%
Because we say,
everyday, Gary and I say,

00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:55.390 align:middle line:84%
everyday, all of life comes to
me with ease and joy and glory.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we expect
our life to show up as.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Without having it
as an "expectation,"

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that's really what we
know life should be.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And so it does.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So three months later, we
had a newly remodeled house.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I say newly
remodeled, we just got--

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.810 align:middle line:84%
nicer stuff on the
floor and around.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And we were in.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I know some people
who still have not

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:90%
gotten back into their houses.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.160 align:middle line:84%
My heart goes out
to them, but I wish

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.660 align:middle line:84%
they would have this
concept of, all of life

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.327 align:middle line:84%
comes to me with ease
and joy and glory.

00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Because once again, your point
of view creates your reality.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Reality does not create
your point of view.

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's your point of
view that may show up.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.410 align:middle line:90%
What shows up?

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to change
our points of view.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's easy to say.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And I understand doing it.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
it to someone who

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.810 align:middle line:84%
is so locked into
a reality, there

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.680 align:middle line:84%
is a ton of judgment
that gets thrown.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Which is why I don't--

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.512 align:middle line:84%
and see, for me, if
I've got somebody who's

00:53:48.512 --> 00:53:50.680 align:middle line:84%
locked in to a reality,
and they're not designed

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.475 align:middle line:90%
to change it, I don't say it.

00:53:52.475 --> 00:53:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you don't
try to change it.

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.642 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: No, I don't
try to change it.

00:53:55.642 --> 00:53:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to also
realize that, if we are going

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the people
that we actually are,

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be the
contribution to this world

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of caring, kindness,
acknowledgment of choice,

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.200 align:middle line:84%
potency, we have to
honor people's choices,

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.250 align:middle line:84%
even when it's not what we
think they should be choosing,

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.380 align:middle line:84%
even when it's not the
possibility for what

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.523 align:middle line:90%
they could choose.

00:54:15.523 --> 00:54:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to honor and
acknowledge their choice.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.847 align:middle line:90%
It's their choice.

00:54:18.847 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The most caring thing
we can do for somebody

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is to honor and
acknowledge their choice.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.222 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:54:24.222 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And that doesn't mean,
if your kids are doing drugs

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.805 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, you honor and
acknowledge that choice.

00:54:28.805 --> 00:54:29.920 align:middle line:90%
No, you still be a parent.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about in most of
the other situations of life.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.050 align:middle line:84%
What about, OK, one
final myth, that we

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.910 align:middle line:84%
have to work hard in
order to make money.

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.330 align:middle line:84%
No, what we have
to do is get over

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.560 align:middle line:90%
our unwillingness to receive.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.442 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is, we're growing up,

00:54:45.442 --> 00:54:46.900 align:middle line:84%
we receive all
kinds of energies we

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.240 align:middle line:84%
don't like-- judgment, abuse,
all these things we talk about,

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we put up
walls to try to keep that out.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you build a
wall, a wall is stupid.

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:90%
It's dumb.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not smart.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just a wall, OK?

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know to let in
money and let enjoy and let

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.930 align:middle line:84%
in people who love you and
keep out judgment and keep out

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:90%
all that.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.430 align:middle line:90%
So it keeps everything out.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So most of us-- and Gary told
me, when I first met him,

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:13.130 align:middle line:84%
he said there's no such
thing as a money problem.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.790 align:middle line:84%
There's only a problem in what
you're willing to receive.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, my god, so true.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So for us, if we can
get over our judgments,

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.590 align:middle line:84%
because every judgment
limits what you can receive,

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and if we can get over
our points of view,

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.357 align:middle line:84%
because every point
of view limits

00:55:26.357 --> 00:55:31.240 align:middle line:84%
what you can receive,
and allow everything

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to come in, including money,
and then start asking for money,

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and it shows up.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.065 align:middle line:90%
I'm simplifying, granted.

00:55:37.065 --> 00:55:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But most of this,
I'm simplifying

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to the best of my ability.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, there's more work
to be done, more tools to use.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
concept behind it

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:90%
and the possibility behind it.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It does I'll
start with one thing.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with your allowing
us to receive in everything

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about here.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you'd like
something in steps,

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.515 align:middle line:84%
you can take a look at
this video here where.

00:55:56.515 --> 00:55:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about five steps
of creating what you want.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.603 align:middle line:90%
Check that out.

00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: One of the things
that has come up recently,

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:06.970 align:middle line:84%
really dynamically, is
the idea of creation.

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.245 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is it?

00:56:09.245 --> 00:56:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've been speaking
about this a lot

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:13.720 align:middle line:84%
in classes lately because
I realize so many of us

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.330 align:middle line:84%
have been given some weird,
skewed point of view of what

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:84%
creation is that makes us
think it's a mental construct

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to judge
each step along the way

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and course-correct
based on our judgments

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and whether we're
meeting our goals.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.780 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work for humanoids.

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.310 align:middle line:90%
So what is creation, really?

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
part of it is, you

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:84%
need to be willing to ask
for what it is you desire.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.825 align:middle line:90%
OK, and this is huge.

00:56:38.825 --> 00:56:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me give an example
of a lady that I

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:41.617 align:middle line:90%
was working with in a class.

00:56:41.617 --> 00:56:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking,
and she wanted

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to change her money situation.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, I'm doing this
tool, and I'm doing this tool,

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing this
tool, and I really

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.542 align:middle line:90%
need to double my income.

00:56:48.542 --> 00:56:50.855 align:middle line:90%
And I said, have you ever asked?

00:56:50.855 --> 00:56:52.892 align:middle line:90%
And she went, what do you mean?

00:56:52.892 --> 00:56:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you ever asked
for that amount of money?

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.890 align:middle line:90%
She went, no.

00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, so
you've been doing tool

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.020 align:middle line:84%
after tool after tool, but
you never said, hey, universe,

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.820 align:middle line:90%
can I have this?

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.270 align:middle line:90%
She went, no.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, do that.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Because she was doing all the
stuff, but she had never asked.

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realize this is one of
the biggest missing elements

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:13.580 align:middle line:90%
in creation.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So right now, think of
one area of your life

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that you would really
like to have change.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You get the sense and the energy
and the space that it would be.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
You get the sense of the way
it would be for that to change

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.400 align:middle line:84%
or for that thing you're
asking for it to show up.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And now ask.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.362 align:middle line:90%
Just go, I'm asking for that.

00:57:30.362 --> 00:57:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking to have
that in my life.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking to have
that as my life.

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:34.753 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking to have
that in my reality.

00:57:34.753 --> 00:57:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking to have
that as my reality.

00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:37.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.887 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing you do is,

00:57:38.887 --> 00:57:41.690 align:middle line:90%
universe, hook a brother up.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Hook a sister up.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Dear consciousness, please help.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
have to acknowledge,

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to change
whatever it takes in order

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.080 align:middle line:90%
to have this show up.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you start to
be willing to allow any change

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to occur, which is
part of this asking

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and then being
willing to receive.

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have this
because this is so basic and so

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:11.210 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to creation
from consciousness

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that, without it,
you're basically

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.040 align:middle line:84%
missing 99% of what
you could choose

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and what you could create.

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:21.080 align:middle line:84%
As you do this, and you ask
for this, then what happens

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.403 align:middle line:84%
is, the stuff that is in
the way, the points of view

00:58:24.403 --> 00:58:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have that
are in the way,

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that people that are in the
way of you having this thing

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that you've been asking for,
start to present themselves

00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:34.250 align:middle line:90%
right in front of your face.

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.740 align:middle line:84%
That's when you want to use
all the other tools that you've

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
been gifted in the
tour of consciousness.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.245 align:middle line:84%
And change the stickiness
that that creates.

00:58:43.245 --> 00:58:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they, and those points
of view, and those people

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.090 align:middle line:90%
will no longer be a roadblock.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you will start to
receive what you're asking for.

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Awesome about receiving.

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.020 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we were talking about.

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.130 align:middle line:84%
When people come into
the world of Access,

00:58:56.130 --> 00:59:00.020 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest thing that
they are desiring or wanting,

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:03.860 align:middle line:84%
in your opinion, or the thing
that they don't have the most?

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: The thing they
seem to be desiring

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:11.650 align:middle line:90%
the most is themselves.

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:13.877 align:middle line:84%
And that shows up in
all kinds of ways.

00:59:13.877 --> 00:59:14.960 align:middle line:90%
They want to change money.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They want to change
relationships.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.960 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because they come
for that kind of change.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to change this
thing, a lot of them.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But they stay for the
being that they're getting.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.497 align:middle line:84%
And so all the
things that we all

00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:29.580 align:middle line:84%
want to change in this
world, they want to change.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.955 align:middle line:84%
They also want to be more of
a contribution to the world.

00:59:31.955 --> 00:59:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, by and
large, the thing they

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.250 align:middle line:84%
desire the most is to just
be able to be happy and not

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.700 align:middle line:90%
be in judgment of themselves.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, happiness
that you can really

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:44.840 align:middle line:84%
get from that freedom in
your body of not feeling

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.798 align:middle line:90%
burdened by your judgments.

00:59:46.798 --> 00:59:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes, or anybody else's.

00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:50.588 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Perceptions, and
those blocks that you have.

00:59:50.588 --> 00:59:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I ask my guests this
because I really

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.505 align:middle line:84%
want to know, what
is the biggest

00:59:53.505 --> 00:59:56.330 align:middle line:90%
reason why you do what you do?

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.740 align:middle line:90%
What's your biggest why?

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: How long do you have?

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:00.695 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We have five minutes.

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: OK, five minutes,
that should be long enough.

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.850 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's the
awareness that there

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is something different possible
for each person on this planet

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.070 align:middle line:90%
if they choose it.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have walked this
journey from being abused

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.800 align:middle line:84%
when I was younger, being in
massive amounts of judgment

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
of myself, getting to the
place I was is literally

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
going to kill myself if
things didn't change,

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
coming to Access Consciousness,
having it start to change,

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and then being part of creating
the tools that would allow

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
it to change faster
and greater for people

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.460 align:middle line:90%
and still do continuously.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've
walked this journey.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.290 align:middle line:10%
And I know, no matter where
anybody is on the journey,

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.340 align:middle line:10%
that there is so
much more possible.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.900 align:middle line:10%
And we don't, as a people,
have to suffer anymore.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
believe that we can't change

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
what is going on in our
lives and, by extension,

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
truly the face of the planet
and what's going on with it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of people
who have given up hope.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
My job, my desire more
than anything else,

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is to give them the hope,
but not only the hope,

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
but the tools to actually
make what they hope

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
is possible a reality.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To not
give them the hope,

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.660 align:middle line:84%
but to give them the
tools to realize that they

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.365 align:middle line:90%
have that inside of themselves.

01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They have that
inside of themselves.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:20.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HEER: Yeah, if I can inspire
them to know what's possible--

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.250 align:middle line:10%
know if they really get--

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.190 align:middle line:10%
this was my life before Access.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.953 align:middle line:84%
This is my life, as
I use these tools.

01:01:26.953 --> 01:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the lives of hundreds
of thousands of people

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
out there using these tools.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that it inspires them
to know that, whatever they're

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:35.760 align:middle line:90%
looking for is possible.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, does it take work?

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This is not just, oh, come to
a class, drop in, drop out,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.480 align:middle line:90%
you're clean.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.115 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:43.463 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it does take work.

01:01:43.463 --> 01:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah, it takes work.

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But anything we do that's
worth doing takes work.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And most of your
classes are virtual,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and people can watch
them on a livestream

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
or go anywhere in the country
to participate in a class.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.225 align:middle line:84%
And there's
different levels of--

01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Or in anywhere in
all kinds of countries.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.815 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
travel, nice vacation,

01:02:03.815 --> 01:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A world, anywhere
in the world, yes.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, to learn, and you make
it accessible, which is great.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Thank you.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: That's
the word Access.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Daine, for
showing us and for being here,

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
being who you are, allowing
other people to have permission

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.820 align:middle line:90%
to be who they are.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Thank you so much, Lisa.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing
this hour with me.
