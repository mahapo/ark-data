>>LISA GARR: Do you
want to know how

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:10%
to be in the right
place at the right time?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.458 align:middle line:10%
We can actually control
that with our thoughts.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And now, it doesn't
happen overnight.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to show up every day.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to be deliberately
focused on your dreams.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
You have to turn your
thoughts into things

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
with your daily practice.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:90%
That is very important.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:10%
This is the teaching of Mike
Dooley, a New York Times

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:10%
bestselling author and creator
of the wildly popular Notes

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:10%
from the Universe, which I love.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It is a philosophical
Adventurers Club

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that's now home to over
800,000 online members.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
You can be one too.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE DOOLEY: Hey, Lisa.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I get your
notes every day.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know you hear
this all the time.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But it always speaks
directly to me.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It hits me in the
middle of the night.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, it
comes in when I'm typing.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Intentionally?

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: You stay up late.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It comes in around
1:00 in the morning.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.022 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sitting
here typing away.

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, how did
he know I was up?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.878 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, thank you for those.

00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: You're welcome.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're amazing.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you
hear this a lot.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's always
good to hear it again.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where did "Notes
from the Universe" come from?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: They emerged from
really the most difficult time

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:10%
of my life.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:10%
It was like my dark
night of the soul.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:10%
It was right at the turn
of the millennia in 1999

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:10%
going into 2000.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And I had just
liquidated a business.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:10%
I was about to turn 40, which
I thought was old at the time.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
I know better now.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were a CPA, right?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, in the
earlier, earlier incarnation

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I was with Price Waterhouse for
six years doing tax as a CPA.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.093 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Then 10 years
selling t-shirts and gifts

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:90%
with my mother and brother.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The t-shirts had my brother's
art but my little sayings

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
about life, dreams,
happiness, visualize,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
picture in your mind the end
results, and things like that.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And I really wished I
could reach more people.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we even had a
following of our souvenir

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
novelty t-shirts and
gifts just for the stuff

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that I would write on them,
as well as my brother's art.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
He was quite popular as well.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of 10 years,
the trends were declining.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
We decided to liquidate
for pennies on the dollar.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I put my accountant's
visor on and realized

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I could coast for two years
before I'd run out of money,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to
make my mortgages.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.167 align:middle line:84%
And while that might
sound like a long time,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I was going
to do with the rest of my life.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I was really, really scared.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I would pray on my knees
at the side of my bed

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.095 align:middle line:90%
every single night to God.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the universe
when I'm happy.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It's God when I'm scared.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:90%
--for direction and guidance.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would bemoan, how could
this have happened to me?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
By 40, I thought I'd be
just living in the dream.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%
But I had nothing.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I had nothing other than my home
and two years' worth of savings

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
to coast.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
receive inspiration.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was way into
metaphysical thinking.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was sending
it out that I knew.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, maybe
I should do this.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You teach best what
you most need to learn,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:90%
as Richard Bach said.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going to
send out inspiration, as Mike,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and see where it goes.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And admittedly, in
hindsight I can tell you,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
compared to writing
Notes from the Universe,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
writing as Mike was
never a big hit.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But I got enough confirmation
and enough feedback,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.093 align:middle line:84%
enough gratitude saying, I
look forward to Mondays now.

00:03:58.093 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I hope you're saving
these for a book one day.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow, really?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great idea.

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:03.255 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And so because I did that,
because I did what I could

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
with what I had,
something I teach now,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:90%
which always seems insufficient.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It always sometimes
seems embarrassing.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is
not who I really am.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing
this to bide time.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It made possible the evolution
of my Monday morning motivators

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.600 align:middle line:84%
into a daily email,
Daily Wisdom from Mike,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
which made possible
me surrendering

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to this inner feeling
that I kept having.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
If I wrote as the
universe, I could say more

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.133 align:middle line:90%
and it would be more impactful.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was arrogant.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was presumptuous.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who am I to write
as divine intelligence?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But I finally surrendered
to the feeling on a Friday.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I wrote something that--

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
it always surprises
me what I write.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Not that I channel it
in a streaming way.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
But everything is channeled.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just difficult for me.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just
journaling it out,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
like maybe Neale Donald
Walsh says he does,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.525 align:middle line:90%
it might take me four hours.

00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
four hours, I'm

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:90%
like, wow, that's really good.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the
very first note was

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
something about, your attention
please, your attention please.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the universe today.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll be recording your every
thought and emotion, no matter

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
how good or bad, no
matter how generous

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
or stingy, no matter how
helpful or hurtful they may be.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And everything I record
will be played back for you

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
as soon as possible as some
type of physical manifestation

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:90%
in time and space.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.135 align:middle line:90%
That is all.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --the universe.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: --the
universe, the universe.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I saw
that it was not arrogant.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I saw that it could be light.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.475 align:middle line:90%
I saw that it could be fun.

00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And truthful.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I saw that
there was room for humor.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And truthful, that was
the most important thing.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
To say something that
we probably all read

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
before, but in a
slightly different way

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that it gets your
attention and maybe stays

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
with you until the next
note from the universe

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
on the next weekday.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Because I take weekends off.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And the humor presented itself.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
If Mike writes you an email and
punctuates it with "You rock.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Mike," it's like,
who is this Mike guy?

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And get off your cloud.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But if the universe writes you
an email, you question it less.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:90%
And you surrender.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And humor, when
the universe says

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
"you rock," the universe, which
some have said, it's levity.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
yeah, that's right.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of world
and divine intelligence

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I live amongst.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And they became and
still are really popular.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.045 align:middle line:84%
They grow by word of
mouth, as you've said.

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:42.905 align:middle line:90%
I have 800,000 subscribers.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is phenomenal.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:90%
One idea, one idea.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Which I
would have thought

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:84%
was stupid if I just sat on my
couch waiting for a good idea.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But because I started writing
as Mike, it set me up to I'll

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%
just test it out on one day.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key to living
the life of your dreams.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.437 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go down these
sucky dirt paths, I call them,

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:06.395 align:middle line:84%
before they'll turn into
the yellow brick road.

00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how many of
us have had that one idea

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
and we threw it away?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And you did it.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: It's very scary.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.235 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:15.027 align:middle line:84%
Think of all those
ideas we've thrown away.

00:07:15.027 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And you made the difference
in millions of people's lives.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And they live for those notes.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:90%
And they're humorous.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that humor
gives us a different energy

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:90%
for something to come in on.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like a conveyor belt.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: People open up.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:90%
They are accepting.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And it has worked out.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it has worked out.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.367 align:middle line:84%
And then as you did
The Secret-- you

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
were one of the wonderful
future teachers in The Secret.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And that also took
a whole other level.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
That kind of raised
the bar quite a bit.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Changed my profile.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Made possible more books.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Made possible larger
audiences in my world tours.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I was touring and writing
before The Secret.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But that took it
to another orbit.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in your tours
all over the world,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
did you find that people
all over the world

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
had the same problems
and they wanted

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.565 align:middle line:84%
the same things, no matter
what culture, what language?

00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Basically, yes.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely the
same, whether Moscow

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
or Capetown or Johannesburg
or Kuala Lumpur.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:90%
But there are differences.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
a strong energy

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%
that comes from a population.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I find some places
that's a bit more elevated,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:90%
a bit finer of a vibration.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
There's more joy in
Africa, ironically,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
where I'm asked, what about
the poor people in Africa?

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:90%
Do their thoughts become things?

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't have to
worry about the poor people

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:90%
They're into family.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:90%
They're into the present moment.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
They're into joy.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're not following
social media like we are,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
at least when I was there.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
dancing, and this.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's
different priorities.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But basically, so the
same, so the same.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Basically wanting
more happiness.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And they might recognize
that in Africa more.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
How can we take this up
and include everybody?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Whereas here-- and this has
become a big part of what I

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:90%
teach--

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
we think we know how
to get to happiness.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I call them the cursed hows.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We think the new house, the
job title, the perfect partner,

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:90%
or the perfect body.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We mess with the cursed hows ad
nauseum in the Western world.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in other parts of
the world, there's more of,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I want joy.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I want more freedom, more
financial freedom even.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Rather than dollar
amounts and deadlines,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
where we are into the
minutiae to such a degree

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:90%
we forget for our happiness.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.645 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost sight
of what it's all about.

00:09:47.645 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it is true.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have this
lack, the sense of lack,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.827 align:middle line:84%
as we're one of
the most abundant.

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:56.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Poverty
of consciousness.

00:09:56.285 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The countries that feel like
they have been labeled poverty,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
they have richness
and abundance.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.933 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
that completely 100%.

00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
here to talk about is

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
how you can change that reality,
whatever your reality is.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But there is a tool
that we all have.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can use it
as a sword, or we

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
can use it as something that
makes us the happiest person

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's right here.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Our thoughts become things.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's the end all, be all.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:90%
It is not a sometimes thing.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It works with all
of our thoughts.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.668 align:middle line:84%
Although, our positive
thoughts are more inclined to

00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
more quickly become the things
and events of our lives.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a tangent we can look at.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.735 align:middle line:90%
But it overrules karma.

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place for a
conversation about karma.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It overrules ancient
spiritual contracts.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a place for that.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:90%
It overrules life lessons.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:90%
It overrules archetype.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: You choose in the
moment what to focus on.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's those
thoughts alone that

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
will become the things
and events of our lives.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And not getting the degree
to which this is true,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.068 align:middle line:84%
the degree of its absoluteness,
we give our power away.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, maybe it wasn't
my thoughts becoming things.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was the
universe's desire for me.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was, I was a
pirate in the 12th century.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe-- so there
goes your power.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It was not those things.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I gotta
tell you this.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Because OK, what if it's
other people's agendas?

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I really want this one thing,
but this other person's

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.915 align:middle line:90%
blocking it.

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Can I influence that
person with my thoughts?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: If you're
a micromanager,

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have trouble
with other people getting

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
in your way.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
going to think they

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
need to behave in a certain way.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
think your happiness is

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
something they might hold the
key to, or part of the key to.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's really infuriating.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Obviously we do this
in relationships

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
or when seeking
the ideal person.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:90%
We know 200 people.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And we think, oh,
it's gotta be her.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:90%
It's gotta be Trixie.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I know it's Trixie.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
If we zero in on Trixie,
we have excluded 7 and 1/2

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:90%
billion other characters.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do
that is not so much

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:90%
try to influence other people.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Although, we certainly
can influence other people

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:90%
if they're open to it.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It is up to them.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
They might shut it down.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And if they were your
gateway, your gatekeeper,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:90%
you're out of luck.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But instead, if you define
the end result wisely,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:90%
the end result is not Trixie.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a rocking relationship,
a travel partner with benefits,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
you want to describe.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
In the instant you get
that kind of clarity

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
with the end result
in a partner,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
or a business partner,
a parcel, an investment,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
financial abundance,
the universe

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:90%
is like, I know how to do that.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There are 7 and 1/2
billion co-creators.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
These are in alignment with you.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:90%
These are not.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to shift
around the stage.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Unless you say, no,
it's gotta be Trixie.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you shut the door
on all other possibilities.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Or you think, oh, it's
Trixie or Bob or Bruno who's

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
going to give me a leg
up in the industry.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you've
given them so much power.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, oh
my god, you need

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to influence them if you can.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
But you might not be able to.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Instead, go to the big
picture end result,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the general area of your life
you'd like transformation in.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And then work it to the
best of your ability.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Go out with Trixie.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Be kind to Bruno.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Knock on doors.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Turn over stones.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And this way, you
leave your idea

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:90%
of the best option on the table.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We're not excluding
Trixie or Bruno.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But you leave the door
open for even better.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And not that there are
better people, obviously.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are better partners
for what your interest is.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And they can now reach you.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you've painted the
picture as a general end

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:84%
result. You got excited
about it with the minutiae.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
You have the vision boards
and the affirmations.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a great place
for all of that stuff,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
for emotional enthusiasm
and ramping up anticipation.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to show up,
show up, and show up and not

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.245 align:middle line:84%
confuse your idea of the
house, your idea of the whos,

00:14:01.245 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
your idea of the whens with
the transformation you're most

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:90%
in search of.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it really
is the universe really

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:90%
has a big part in this for you.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not just your thoughts.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
It's really your thoughts and
the universe playing together.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: There's really
only you and more you.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
universe out there.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of an old trade-off
from, God's out there, angry,

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.447 align:middle line:84%
jealous, testing,
and judging us.

00:14:30.447 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Something far closer to truth is
that the universe is out there

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
adoring you, wanting for you
what you want for yourself.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
But even that is a metaphor.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Even that is false.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:90%
The universe is in here.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:90%
We are in here.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You're in here.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We're living our dramas
and our adventures

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:90%
out right now inside of God.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And we are, more
accurately, God come alive

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in the dream of life.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're just another
part of that God.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm a part of that God.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
We're really one.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Talk about
reincarnational families.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's me and you and
everybody watching right now.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no delineation.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So to say that it's about your
thoughts engaging the universe

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It's your thoughts
engaging your higher self

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and these metaphysical
principles that

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely unfailing.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Namely, our thoughts become the
things and events of our lives.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And to present yourself,
or avail yourself of,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
such manifestations you need to
hold onto the vision, the end

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
result, the big
picture transformation,

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
get into the details,
knock on doors,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
show up, press the flesh,
make some cold calls,

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:90%
move your feet.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all of this
wiggle room and latitude

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.767 align:middle line:90%
for mindblowing coincidences.

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:90%
There ain't no such thing.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Serendipities, accidents
that might seem bad at first.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
a setup for better.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything, everything
is a setup for better.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We are eternal gladiators
of love and joy.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we really are co-creating.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.493 align:middle line:84%
And we're really actually
orchestrating the whole thing.

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:02.868 align:middle line:84%
And all of the thoughts-- so
we just had these last three

00:16:02.868 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:90%
amazing days.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And everything worked
out in this puzzle piece

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that we could never have
possibly imagined it to be.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And we thought at the
time it was a catastrophe.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And oh my goodness,
what happened?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of the three days,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we just said to ourselves, we
couldn't plan this any better.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that we
actually planned all of that

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.265 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts of what we
actually wanted as the outcome?

00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: The way that works is
you had little micromanaged end

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And we do have to do that
to get through a day.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.575 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be here at
such and such a time.

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%
I need to make a phone call.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's all fine and good.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It's when we think,
that call didn't come

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's the end of the world.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we deflate
our anticipation.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And we no longer feel optimism.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we put further away
the ultimate end result.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Your real end results are a
rocking life, a rocking career,

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:84%
harmony with those on your
team at home and in the field.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And those end results
that you believe in,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that you move with, that
are dressed up with pictures

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
on a vision board
or affirmation,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
are pressing to you all of the
serendipities and the logistics

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately
blow your mind.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But those you cannot control,
other than you ordained them

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
with end results
that required them.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how you manipulate the
circumstances of your life.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
But that's always beyond
your field of awareness,

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:90%
beyond our comprehension.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Our brain knows in design
to manage these logistics,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
account for these logistics,
prepare for these logistics.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It can't.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.827 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: It cannot do that.

00:17:33.827 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to assess
and pass judgment

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.065 align:middle line:84%
on what we like in our life and
what we don't like in our life.

00:17:39.065 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
unspiritual about saying,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't like this bucket but
I really love this bucket.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we find a
bucket we don't like,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
we change the end
result. We raise the bar.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I want harmony in
my relationships.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I want healing in my body.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I want money in the bank.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Those are great end results.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.220 align:middle line:90%
And then show up, show up.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Do your little lighthearted
micromanagement, but not

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
with attachment.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Attach to the big picture.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Attach to joy.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Attach to abundance.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Attach to healing.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:90%
And settle for nothing less.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to showing up--

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try
to get this interview,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try
to meet that person,

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm and try to
host this event,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try
to write that book--

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
do it to the best
of your ability.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Be all in.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:90%
But leave room for even better.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Leave room for a surprise.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the circumstances
disappoint, or break

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
your heart, or
whatever they may be,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a
greater good in alignment

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:90%
with your ordained end results.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have natural
end results to thrive.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:90%
So we don't even have to--

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
what is my big picture
transformation going to be?

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're hurting for
money, that's a good one.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, start there.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.422 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: If you're
like, everything's cool

00:18:46.422 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and I really love my
life, well, then just

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:90%
keep living your life.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And your divine sense
of incompletion,

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
which we're all endowed
with, which we often think

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:90%
is a curse.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Like, am I never satisfied?

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to be perfect?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: There's nothing
wrong with always wanting

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
more so long as
you don't put off

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:90%
your happiness for that more.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Be happy in the wanting.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And then that divine
sense of incompletion

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
will take that person
who has no stated goals,

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
but who lives and grooves
in their life, who's

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
out there pressing the flesh,
meeting their comfort zone,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
exceeding their comfort
zone occasionally,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
their life will
continue to improve.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just the nature
of the network of consciousness

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.460 align:middle line:90%
alive, ever-expanding.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:90%
God never stops.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.855 align:middle line:90%
We never stop as parts of God.

00:19:30.855 --> 00:19:31.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:32.697 align:middle line:90%
But we want it instantly.

00:19:32.697 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:90%
We want it now.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
happen necessarily.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.528 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: That's why I get to
do workshops and write books.

00:19:37.528 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Because it is that simple.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:90%
But we need to cool our jets.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stop
passing judgment

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
based on what our physical
senses are showing us.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
There is room for fine-tuning
this art of living your dreams.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And so there's work to be done.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it is.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here
at Mike Dooley talking

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:90%
about thoughts becoming things.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.698 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:56.698 --> 00:19:58.626 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever heard the
expression be careful of what

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
you wish for because
you just might get it?

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I bet you have.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, not only
have you heard it,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:90%
but I bet you believe it's true.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:84%
You've also heard about
and believe in the powers

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of positive thinking.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And no doubt you've heard
about the art of visualization.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You could probably
even share a story

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
or two of how visualizing has
worked wonders in your life.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason you've heard
all of these expressions.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason they resonate
for you and for virtually

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
every person, regardless of
nationality, on planet earth.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You know the truth, even if
you haven't yet given it words.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Instinctively, you
know that you're

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
powerful, worthy,
and deserving of all

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that your heart longs for.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And instinctively,
you know that you're

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
a divine, magnificent
spiritual being for whom

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.415 align:middle line:90%
all things are possible.

00:21:02.415 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.076 align:middle line:90%
In three simple words--

00:21:10.076 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Thoughts
become things.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:10%
That's the principle.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:10%
Thoughts become things.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Not sometimes, but often.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And not just your positive
thoughts, but the other ones

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it is an
immutable law as rigid,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
as predicted, and every bit
as dependable as gravity.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, with regard
to this principle

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
operating in your life,
you can't ever turn it off.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't bad news.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome news.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Because they're your thoughts.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And every minute
of every day you

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
get to choose exactly what
you're going to think.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And with this principle, you
can bring virtually anything

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine into your life.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just limited
to material things.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine more love,
more joy, more laughter.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I love that.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
We can never turn it off.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I love the certainty
that you have in this.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It is your belief system
and your conviction

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that enables us to have the
same when you say, this is law.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.345 align:middle line:90%
And you live like that.

00:22:42.345 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I believe
really firmly--

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and this may even come
off abrasively, what I'm

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
about to say, to some at first.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe that
the truth is absolute.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It is knowable.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It is benign.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And to those folks who say,
everyone has their own truth,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:90%
I want to cringe.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You are throwing your
power out the window.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
To think everyone
has their own truth

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
is like, we'd be slipping
and falling around.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And walnuts would
turn into elephants.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And you could not bank
or depend on anything.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
While there are a million roads
to Rome, not one of those roads

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
changes Rome.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
Rome is the truth.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has their
own way to truth.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But what's so
vitally important--

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and what I most want to
convey to my readers,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
my audiences-- is
that this is absolute.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is a good thing.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:90%
This is great news.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:84%
This is that part
of God in you that

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
streams your circumstances,
your life, into place.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the power you have.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And to take anything and
use it to dilute this,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I think, patently obvious
truth of consciousness

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:84%
creating reality is risking
a major setback in life.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's the truth,
consciousness creating reality.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Absolute.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the
immutable truth.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.535 align:middle line:90%
That is Rome.

00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: That's Rome.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Nothing, nothing, nothing,
nothing can change that.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And somebody might say,
well, God could change that.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are alive here.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the adventure of life,
in these sacred hallowed jungles

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
time and space, to
see what can happen.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, that statement puts
God on the outside looking in.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no God or universe
on the outside looking in.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Which is not to say that
God isn't infinitely more

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
than me or you or
everybody alive--

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:90%
infinitely, unimaginably more.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's not out there.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's in here.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We are of God.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
We are by God.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:90%
We are for God.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:90%
We are pure God.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And it is God's thoughts.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
This is what we are.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Thinking, spiritual
beings of God

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that form and craft this
magnificent adventure where

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
every single day, no matter
what happened the day before, we

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.765 align:middle line:84%
can love and be loved,
create, and adventure.

00:25:08.765 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All over again.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: --heal.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like this
is heaven on earth.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And not that heaven
couldn't be grander.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's pretty darn good here.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, then OK,
so challenging on this.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts become things.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I want a million dollars.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.786 align:middle line:90%
I know you've heard this before.

00:25:27.786 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: You can have it.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.255 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now?

00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's not
a spontaneous thing.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Something even more
miraculous happens,

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, when you want
a million dollars

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and you've bought the
ticket, bought the ticket

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
to play in these sacred jungles.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.965 align:middle line:90%
There's realities without time.

00:25:43.965 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:90%
There's realities without space.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
There's realities we could
never wrap our head around.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But here, clearly,
there's momentum.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We're living a communal
dream, if you will,

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of seven and 1/2
billion co-creators.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And so there has to be kind
of an agreement, a grid--

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
like Greg talks
about, like Dr. Joe

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
probably talks about--
where they match science

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:90%
to spirituality.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And the grid says that
Paris has the Eiffel Tower.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's not going to
be an Eiffel Tower here.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And the grid says that
there was a yesterday

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and a today and a tomorrow all
springing from an eternal now.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So we bought a ticket where
there's these physical laws,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:90%
these energy coordinate points.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Where physically,
it will one day

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
be explained exactly how
our thoughts become things.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But until then,
we're in this soup.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And unlike a
nighttime dream, which

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
is otherwise identical
to the daytime dream,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.483 align:middle line:84%
except there's a lone dreamer,
not seven and 1/2 billion.

00:26:38.483 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:84%
In a nighttime
dream, I can think,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
gold coins and a
million dollars,

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's in the palm of my hand.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
In a dream where there's
this continuity that we agree

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:90%
to called time and space both.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
ticket we bought.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.793 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: That's the
ticket we bought.

00:26:50.793 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
But which does not limit us.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It just slows the
manifestation process down.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So instead of manifesting a
million dollars spontaneously,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the more miraculous thing
that starts happening

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
is its nearest equivalent.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:90%
And I mean equivalent.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean a million
dollars in gold coins,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
or stock certificates, or
your business ballooning

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:90%
overnight, blowing up.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The nearest equivalent
is being pressed to you

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
in the moment you
had that thought.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And to experience it, to
merge this now with that now--

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:90%
we call the future--

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:90%
you need to show up.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
You need to get out.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You need to maintain
the thought--

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.953 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The next step,
next step, next step.

00:27:28.953 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And the next step,
to kind of string the moments

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.793 align:middle line:84%
together, you have
to vigilantly hold

00:27:34.793 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that thought of a
million dollars.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.502 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:27:37.502 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%
It's going go out the window.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.567 align:middle line:84%
That's why you want to get
excited about it emotionally.

00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
A million dollars,
great, a million dollars.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.442 align:middle line:90%
What's a million dollars?

00:27:45.442 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
A million, can I even
comprehend a million dollars?

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's lay flat sleep receipts
all around the world.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
A million dollars is a home in
Florida and a home in Mexico.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
A million dollars is freedom
for my wife and my daughter.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:84%
A million-- now
I'm dressing it up

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'm feeling some passion.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to carry
me through the moments.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the
thought that goes in one ear

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:90%
and out the other.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And while I hold
that passion, I need

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to do my best, which will
always seem insufficient.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I need to do my best to now
move towards a million dollars.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:90%
So buy the lottery ticket.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Start the business.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Expand the business.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Write the book.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Ask for a raise.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Move towards abundance.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You must, you must, in your own
way, in your own calculations,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
do your best to
move towards that

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
which you want while
holding the vision,

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:84%
while enjoying your life,
while giving yourself

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:90%
permission to be happy now.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you've already
manifested so much

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:90%
through you and everyone else.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:52.135 align:middle line:84%
And so you can enjoy the journey
and prepare to be astounded.

00:28:52.135 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the knuckleheads
who have a million dollars.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be the
sharpest tool in the shed.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
a goody two shoes.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You just have to have
the audacity to believe.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And believing in it will come
when you hold onto that thought

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and move with that thought.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then what
happens commonly--

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and I've done this-- is
immediately those thoughts come

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:90%
in, equally if not bigger.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
You don't have it now.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to get there?

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:90%
What is a million anyway?

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Wait, that's a lot of zeros.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm at 10.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Then you move on.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Am I being selfish?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Is it too materialistic?

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.380 align:middle line:10%
Big money, big problems.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, you fritter it away.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:10%
But one of my
favorite epiphanies

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:10%
of my life in these years, 19
now, that I've been teaching

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:10%
is a recognition that
everyone can have,

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:10%
before I'm done speaking, of our
innate inclination to thrive.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We are here as the eyes
and the ears of God

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:90%
to just rock this joint.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is why God
would want to be me and you.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And God most wanted to
be you when you were born

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and most wanted to be-- we
are who God most wanted to be

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and still most wants to be
for our mere presence here.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And where God goes,
God can have God's way.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I can have my way when I
understand wisely chosen end

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
results, I keep the energy,
and I understand at long last--

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%
my favorite new teaching point--

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:90%
my inclination to succeed.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Which means it's as if
my positive thoughts are

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:84%
at least 10,000
times more powerful

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:90%
than my negative thoughts.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't have to
be positive all the time.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to remember what

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the dream was every single day.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.325 align:middle line:90%
Go out and enjoy your life.

00:30:32.325 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Visualize no more
than once a day,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:90%
no longer than five minutes.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Get back to the here and now.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And the proof that will
help those watching achieve

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:84%
the tipping point to recognizing
this crazy inclination

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to succeed is taking
stock of our own lives.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:90%
We all smile more than we frown.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.663 align:middle line:90%
We all laugh more than we cry.

00:30:53.663 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
We want to say it's a jungle
out there in a bad way.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
We want to say, oh, it's
survival of the fittest.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Eat or be eaten.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants money.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that one.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.247 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, no, look, you've
blown the lid off of survival.

00:31:05.247 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching right now has
blown the lid off of survival.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
we're still here.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: We have clarity
more than we're confused.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:84%
We have health more
than we're sick.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.043 align:middle line:84%
We have friends more
than we're alone.

00:31:13.043 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:90%
So a crazy degree.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have money more than
we're broke to a crazy degree.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.803 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've never
been in a place

00:31:20.803 --> 00:31:22.720 align:middle line:84%
where there's been no
one to call in our life.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've almost never been in
a place where we're in the red

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:90%
financially.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we realize this
propensity, this inclination,

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to thrive and we kind
of reassure ourselves,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you want a million
bucks, you can have it.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:90%
You can so have it.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.198 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that thriving
piece is important.

00:31:38.198 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because one would think that the
level that they thrive in life

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:90%
is the million bucks.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's better than
a million bucks.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
That level of thriving and
loving and being alive,

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.666 align:middle line:84%
if you really look at
it, exceeds a price tag.

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's also--

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: You're
not asking for much

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
if you want a million dollars,
if you want $100 million.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:04.150 align:middle line:84%
That we are here is so much more
than whatever we could do here.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could have Oprah
Winfrey's net worth times 10.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't compare to
the fact that you are you.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
This unique precious
window through which

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
God, which is just the
bigger part of ourself, God

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:90%
can peer out at her creations.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --can see.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And the wonder of it
all that we are even breathing

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:90%
is so mind boggling.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.797 align:middle line:90%
And joy can be found in that.

00:32:29.797 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And then if you want to
decorate the tree with a million

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
dollars, or a new best
friend, or a rocking career,

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:90%
you got it.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:90%
You can even worry.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You can be negative.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
In my dark days, the
dark night of my soul,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I would speak at a rotary club.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:90%
They'd be very unappreciative.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get
thoughts become things.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:90%
This was 19 years ago.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Great organization.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But my talks 19 years
ago didn't go over well.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd go home and bad
mouth my life to my mom.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd bum cigarettes off of her.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I was miserable.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
When is my life
going to take off?

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And I still prevail.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I still would
visualize once a day.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I still had a vision board
to keep my spirits up.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I still would be
firm with myself

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that it's like, you
are here for a reason.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You're inclined to succeed.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we're all pushed
onto greatness every single day.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And just reminding myself that
a little bit amidst my worries.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --changes
everything, right?

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It all happened.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.405 align:middle line:90%
My life is a fairy tale.

00:33:26.405 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's also
other things that you

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
can create with this, not
just money and things.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
video, where you can really

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.872 align:middle line:84%
change the way
that you experience

00:33:36.872 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things in your life.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.755 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:33:38.755 --> 00:33:40.588 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: This is why
people think they need

00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:42.180 align:middle line:10%
to mess with the cursed hows.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I'm here physically.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:10%
I want to be there physically
in abundance with friends

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:10%
and no credit card debt.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:10%
So I must physically
wrangle this whole thing.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:10%
Brain is too small to
figure out the hows

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:10%
of any dream come true.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:10%
The brain's function
is to define what

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:10%
you want in terms of the end.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:10%
The instant you
define the end result,

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.250 align:middle line:10%
divine intelligence knows how.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:10%
And the sequence of
events necessary for there

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:10%
to be a manifestation
that mirrors

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:10%
the end in mind, the
thought, will play itself out

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:10%
as we take action.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:10%
We only need to
have an end result,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:10%
show up, show up, show up.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:10%
Then the end will force the
circumstances of our lives

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:10%
that will yield these so-called
coincidences, serendipities,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:10%
and happy accidents that will
bring about a manifestation

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:10%
mirroring the starting point.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:10%
This is thoughts
becoming things.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not literal.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't happen in two seconds.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:10%
There is a morphing
of your entire life.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:10%
The circumstances
begin changing.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And the circumstances
change because you've

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.360 align:middle line:10%
issued new marching orders
with a new end result.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And you showed up every day,
in spite of appearances,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:10%
so that all of a sudden you
could be in the right place

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:10%
at the right time
experiencing that aha moment.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:03.265 align:middle line:10%
Who said-- woo hoo--

00:35:03.265 --> 00:35:05.595 align:middle line:10%
who said--

00:35:05.595 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I love that part.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:84%
People really get so
excited about your words.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.115 align:middle line:90%
Because it makes so much sense.

00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us
an example of how

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
this has worked in someone's
life, other than just your own?

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.065 align:middle line:84%
People that have told
stories and given you

00:35:20.065 --> 00:35:22.065 align:middle line:84%
examples of how this
really worked and showed up

00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:90%
in their life?

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Oh, a fun
story from so many years

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.205 align:middle line:90%
ago was a woman wrote to me.

00:35:27.205 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she was
reading Infinite Possibilities.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about
demonstrations and acts

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:90%
of faith.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is another
financial one.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But you're right--
it works with love.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It works with money.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It works with healing.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing it
doesn't work with.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
illustratively when

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
a material world

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and everyone wishes
they had more money,

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.370 align:middle line:84%
it happens to be a very
handy point of reference.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.543 align:middle line:84%
So this woman was reading
Infinite Possibilities.

00:35:56.543 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
thoughts becoming

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:90%
things, creative visualization.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And she became aware of a
basketball bar sponsorship

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:84%
where if anybody could
sink a basketball

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
from cross court
on one throw, they

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:84%
would get from the
bar a million dollars.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so she organized
a family meeting

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
where everyone was assigned an
act of faith, a demonstration.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:84%
In addition to visualizing
about winning the million

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.230 align:middle line:84%
dollars, which her brother
was the one signed up

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to throw the
basket, everyone was

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.385 align:middle line:84%
assigned to pretend as if
it had already happened.

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's called
the demonstration,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:84%
acting as if it has
already happened.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.928 align:middle line:84%
This is a little different than
baby steps in the direction

00:36:42.928 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:90%
of your dreams.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This is like going beyond
and playfully pretending

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're already living
the life of your dreams.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So one person was assigned
to the live entertainment

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:90%
at the celebration party.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Another person was
assigned to sending out

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:84%
invitations to all of
their friends and family

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate the basket being
sunk in one shot cross court.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else was assigned
to alerting the media.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:90%
So everyone had a job.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And they all had to literally
do everything they could,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
bar actually executing it,
in a playful, pretending way

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.983 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate their belief
that this was going to happen.

00:37:17.983 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm
telling you the story

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
because Theo, her brother,
sunk the basket on one

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.075 align:middle line:84%
throw across court, got a
check for a million dollars.

00:37:25.075 --> 00:37:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my god,
it really happened.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And that was a fast one.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But they did it
in a playful way.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
best, lighthearted.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And they added in
these demonstrations.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Like the story I shared
with Rhonda Byrne

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that eventually made its way
into the book The Secret.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It was not in the
movie The Secret.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The woman who was at one of
my events in Sydney, Australia

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:84%
said, Mike, I've brought
my dinner partner.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:90%
This is my manifestation.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And she proceeded to tell
everybody at the table

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.697 align:middle line:84%
the story of her being
single for much longer

00:38:00.697 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:90%
than she would like.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to do more
than just visualize it.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So she playfully pretended
throughout her home

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that there was somebody
she was sharing it with,

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:90%
the man of her dreams.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So she stopped parking in the
middle of the two-car garage,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.787 align:middle line:84%
started parking on her
side of the two-car garage,

00:38:17.787 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and made room for his
car, even though there

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
was no his car or him.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
She cleaned out
a closet for him.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.760 align:middle line:84%
She started sleeping on her
side of the king sized bed.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.597 align:middle line:84%
She would occasionally set out
placemat settings for dinner

00:38:30.597 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
for two people, even
though it was just her,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and light a candle to boot.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And she pretended that there
was this great relationship

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:90%
in her life.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the dinner
party, there he was.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I met the guy.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was her manifestation,
somebody obviously

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.820 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with her desire.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe three months later,
I got an email saying,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.960 align:middle line:90%
guess what-- we're engaged.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I was doing my book
Leveraging the Universe,

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and I said, can I use your
story in my book Leveraging

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:90%
the Universe?

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes,
and guess what--

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:90%
we're already married.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:90%
So it works in love.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:90%
It works in play.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It works in money.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.660 align:middle line:90%
It works in health and healing.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Buy the shoes for
the ball that you

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
want to go to that
you're not going to.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.948 align:middle line:84%
Buy the shoes if you're
not fit enough to exercise.

00:39:16.948 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But now you're serious
and you're going to do it.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.115 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was my other
question is about health.

00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Can thoughts become
things when you

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
want to have a health
situation reversed,

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:84%
or lose weight, or
have a healthier body,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
or get motivated to work out?

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.802 align:middle line:84%
Something like
that, how do you--

00:39:32.802 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Always
and only, our body

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.170 align:middle line:90%
is our most intimate creation.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I advise when
it comes to health--

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:84%
more than just fitness--
but when it comes to health,

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:84%
always play both
ends to the middle.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Do not forgo your normal doctor.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Do not forgo his or her advice.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Cover those bases.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then go visualize, do
demonstrations, buy the running

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:90%
shoes within their guidelines.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
This positivity, this
demonstration towards--

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I am going to be
able to walk again,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I am going to get outside of
the house again, I am fit,

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I am recovering-- combined
with affirmations, combined

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:84%
with vision boards, combined
with a sense of appreciation

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and a recognition of our
inclination to succeed

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
will always be enough
to turn the tide

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and bring about
health in a safe way

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that you need not risk anything.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's interesting,
because you can really,

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it helps you with
these thoughts in your mind

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.810 align:middle line:84%
You won't go after
the chocolate cake.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.850 align:middle line:90%
You won't go after potato chips.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're constantly
reminding yourself of this

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:84%
thought becoming
this fitter body

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:84%
or this in-shape
or healthy body.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And the vision boards,
of course, help.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.497 align:middle line:90%
Because they're a visual.

00:40:50.497 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts of ways
to do vision boards, which

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.087 align:middle line:90%
is really exciting.

00:40:54.087 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And there's apps for that.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's an app for
thoughts become things.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's really cool.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Thoughts
from the Universe, yes.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thoughts from
the Universe, yes.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:90%
And so that helps a lot.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: It all helps.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:90%
It's an art.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
combination, right?

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.827 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: You can succeed
without visualizing.

00:41:08.827 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:84%
You can succeed
without affirmations.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot succeed unless
your thoughts are there.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And if vision boards or
affirmations and demonstrations

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:84%
help steer your mind there, help
prevent you from being fearful

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and negative-- which,
there is room for that,

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.300 align:middle line:84%
but if we can mitigate
it, let's do that--

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:90%
then it all helps.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And it works for absolutely,
totally everything.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:84%
There's just too many
stories of cancer remissions,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and people living with a
disease for normal life spans,

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that one has to say,
something's going on.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
conventional medicine.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not just luck.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not just their genes.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It's their focus.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's their attitude.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It's their energy.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It's their thoughts
becoming things.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you say it works
for virtually everything.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:90%
When hasn't it worked?

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Ah, ah, ah--

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.767 align:middle line:90%
this is fun and tricky.

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
things that I'll tell

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:90%
you are impossible.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is making Trixie
fall in love with you.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:84%
That is saying, my book
will be a bestseller.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
You need other people to
play that game with you.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can't be assured.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are some things
you can't make happen.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to specific other
people behaving a certain way,

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:90%
it might work; it might not.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.512 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
there's gatekeepers.

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Right,
the gatekeepers.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.210 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to saying, this
is how my dream will come true

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.377 align:middle line:84%
and you become a micromanager,
you can't see trends.

00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:36.252 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what the
currencies are doing.

00:42:36.252 --> 00:42:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't know the
political environment.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Just don't go there.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It might work.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.517 align:middle line:84%
You can sometimes
micromanage a cursed how.

00:42:42.517 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people have said, I'm
going to win that race,

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and they got the gold
medal in the Olympics

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:90%
and they beat everybody else.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And some people said, that
book will be a bestseller,

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.270 align:middle line:90%
and it became a bestseller.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.812 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
to do it that way.

00:42:51.812 --> 00:42:52.790 align:middle line:90%
That's too much stress.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.373 align:middle line:84%
How many people said that book
will do it and it didn't do it?

00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead, say, I will have a
creatively fulfilled career.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I will live in
wealth and abundance.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I will be surrounded by
friends and laughter.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I will experience health
and healing like never

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:90%
before in my life.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can have those things.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we
ever wanted anyway.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We just thought
we had to wrangle

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:90%
the hows, the whos, the whens.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
get in our own way.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The cursed hows.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really thought
and have it become a thing

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to change the president, or
have somebody new elected,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:90%
or make a bestselling--

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: No.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Those things might
work, might not work.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.702 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what you can
do is go for the outcome.

00:43:30.702 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:90%
What is the feeling you want?

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:32.945 align:middle line:90%
Do you want freedom?

00:43:32.945 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Right.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Those big picture qualities.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone's going to
visualize the gold medal

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.520 align:middle line:90%
and get it.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:84%
That can't happen there's a
very limited number of them.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's not happiness.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:90%
It could be a great goal.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can visualize
and manifest happiness.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can manifest
more friends.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can manifest
a body that they love.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can manifest healing.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we ever
cared about anyway.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:84%
We just thought, I won't
be happy until I do that.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.545 align:middle line:90%
Well, good luck.

00:44:01.545 --> 00:44:02.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not
writing books on--

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: That's
a lot of stress.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.565 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --on how your
thoughts don't become things.

00:44:05.565 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You're writing books
about the positive,

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
how they can become
things, and how

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through your
life with possibilities.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Then why would you
write the other book?

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.675 align:middle line:90%
How not to create your life.

00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: No, no,
no, no-- we're here

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to live deliberately
and create consciously.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.048 align:middle line:84%
And not that you have to
make something happen.

00:44:25.048 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:84%
If you can just go into
the happiness mode,

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.140 align:middle line:90%
go into the happiness mode.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But I know you have a divine
sense of incompletion that's

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:84%
going to say, but
what about this?

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And what about that?

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not necessarily monetary.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:90%
But you want to expand.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
God wants to expand,
become more, to be wiser,

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we've done it all
and been there everywhere

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in time and space, well,
there are, I'm sure,

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.060 align:middle line:84%
an infinite number
of other realms

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.390 align:middle line:84%
where God is now expanding,
where we are now ready to go.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this newest book
is the Beginner's Guide.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the story of this book.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, by now, 19
years after my dark night

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, I have
written about 3,000 Notes

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.040 align:middle line:90%
from the Universe.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I may say
so, many of them

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:90%
have some real nuggets in them.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, I am a
first-time, late-blooming dad.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a five-year-old daughter
that is my pride and joy.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And in talking
with my publisher,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.070 align:middle line:90%
we spoke on possible projects.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd really
like to write a book

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:90%
with my daughter in mind.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a legacy?

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Like a legacy--

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
my experience is, family
doesn't read my books.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm the brother.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm the son.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.703 align:middle line:90%
I'm the dad.

00:45:36.703 --> 00:45:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
case for a lot of us.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.828 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I'm sure
I'll be the dad.

00:45:39.828 --> 00:45:42.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, that's Mike.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So she probably won't read
my 16 books, or however

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:90%
many more I write.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But if she was to read just
one, please, dear sweetheart,

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.090 align:middle line:90%
just read one book.

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.593 align:middle line:84%
I'll dedicate it to you.
--when you're an adult.

00:45:53.593 --> 00:45:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It would be this one,
A Beginner's Guide

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.718 align:middle line:84%
to the Universe, where I've
written eight different letters

00:45:57.718 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to her, that any
person could relate to,

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.990 align:middle line:84%
sharing my own
epiphanies because

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of her being in my life.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've shared 500 of
my best, best, best Notes

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:90%
from the Universe.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And the best parts
of those notes

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.260 align:middle line:84%
whittled down to kind
of just life lessons.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So they don't come across
as Notes from the Universe.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:90%
They're just life lessons.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And it covers the gamut
from relationships

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to setbacks to
comebacks to everything

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that one would need to live
in the most harmonious, joyful

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:90%
life possible.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.885 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what it is.

00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
beautiful thing.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And for anyone who wants to get
kind of the beginner's guide.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for your daughter.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of--

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So you know it's
done really well.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think it will continue
to do well and outlast me

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.340 align:middle line:84%
in the sacred jungles
of time and space.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're young.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're going
to go watch another video

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.480 align:middle line:84%
talking about, and
really looking at, how,

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.920 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts become things.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.672 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:08.672 --> 00:47:18.432 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: By understanding
the nature of reality,

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.100 align:middle line:10%
we can then set out
to live deliberately.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:10%
No more hit and misses.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:28.480 align:middle line:10%
When it works, it doesn't work.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.100 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it works,
but we wished it hadn't.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the ones who say, life
is hard and people are mean.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the ones who say
they have no free time.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.388 align:middle line:90%
These are their end results.

00:47:42.388 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
that they didn't know

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:90%
that they were the end results.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Your friend who says,
I can't lose weight,

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I just can't lose
weight, is always right.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The universe is up there
watching and listening.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I heard you the
first 7,642 times.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.395 align:middle line:90%
Do not worry-- we're on it.

00:47:57.395 --> 00:47:59.937 align:middle line:84%
You will be in the wrong place
at the wrong time, predisposed

00:47:59.937 --> 00:48:01.521 align:middle line:84%
to the wrong food
by the wrong friends

00:48:01.521 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:84%
with no willpower
and slow metabolism.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.333 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:05.133 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:05.133 --> 00:48:09.430 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:10%
We are literally the
eyes and the ears of God

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.950 align:middle line:10%
come alive in the dream of
life, therefore pushed on

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.350 align:middle line:10%
to greatness every single
day, inclined to succeed.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:24.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the nature of a life
in the illusions of time

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and space, where each
and every one of us

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:84%
has chosen to fleetingly
forget the truth.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You chose to forget those
things, to believe in the lies,

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
have adventure.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So that you'd be gripped
by your passions,

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.257 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
reach to perfect

00:48:40.257 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and become more, and learn, and
fall in love again and again

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, in
the blink of an eye,

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.925 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wake back up
in the palm of God's hand.

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, that is so true.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.310 align:middle line:90%
That happens to us all the time.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:84%
When we repeat these thoughts
of what we don't want,

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:90%
there it is.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah, marching orders.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.367 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment.

00:49:01.367 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:90%
There's never been any judgment.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.390 align:middle line:90%
The only judgment is our own.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Divine intelligence
loves us unfailingly.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we say, I
can't lose weight--

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I see food and I gain weight--

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the universe is like,
you keep telling me.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:14.670 align:middle line:90%
We're on it.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't you worry.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why I said
earlier in the other clip,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not just our
positive thoughts.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.500 align:middle line:84%
It's all of our
thoughts that equally

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:84%
strive to become the things
and events of our lives.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So pay attention to
what you're saying.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.838 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to
what you're thinking.

00:49:30.838 --> 00:49:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to
what you're shopping

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:90%
for in the grocery store.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you buying the cheapest,
cheapest, cheapest stuff?

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.187 align:middle line:90%
What we just said.

00:49:38.187 --> 00:49:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Be intentional about it.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.380 align:middle line:90%
So this is the next question.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to create
something, a lot of people

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:90%
don't know their purpose.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what they want.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard this a lot?

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Oh, gosh,
so, so, so, so much.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
a flawed question.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it presumes
that there's something

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.960 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to be doing
or wanting, or a certain way

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.810 align:middle line:84%
you should be growing, and
all other ways are wrong.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, you're
here to see what happens.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You kind of meticulously
designed from head

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.853 align:middle line:84%
to toe this amazing vehicle
that would carry you

00:50:10.853 --> 00:50:11.770 align:middle line:90%
through this lifetime.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:12.890 align:middle line:90%
You picked your parents.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, everybody.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.250 align:middle line:90%
You picked your parents.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for the love they
would give you, maybe

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.270 align:middle line:84%
for the love they
would deny you.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.890 align:middle line:90%
But you had a plan.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And that plan was
all about love.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.520 align:middle line:90%
That plan was all about growth.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that plan was to
kind of go down a path

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.513 align:middle line:84%
so that you could be the
light bearer for others

00:50:29.513 --> 00:50:31.930 align:middle line:84%
who wouldn't have to go through
what you would go through.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.010 align:middle line:90%
There are only heroes.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.140 align:middle line:90%
There are only heroines.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But you designed this
vehicle, in large part

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.475 align:middle line:84%
to see what you
would do with it.

00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Let me be a little
bit more analytical.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Let me be a little more artsy.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Let me be a little
more inquisitive.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.275 align:middle line:84%
Let me be a little
more Forrest Gump.

00:50:48.275 --> 00:50:49.400 align:middle line:90%
--to see what would happen.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
live a lifetime,

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I do believe we come back.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation is true
and it's not true.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole notion
is based on a timeline.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And time is an illusion.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's false to begin with.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But maybe like leaves
on a tree, our soul

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:90%
lives many, many times.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And so you have one lifetime.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And you learn certain lessons.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.648 align:middle line:84%
You have certain cravings,
certain things you didn't

00:51:12.648 --> 00:51:13.690 align:middle line:90%
do that you wanted to do.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you kind of rig the
stage for your next lifetime

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.880 align:middle line:84%
so that you might go
more down this path.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.673 align:middle line:84%
And it would never be, I want
all of my lives to be rich.

00:51:21.673 --> 00:51:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to always be
gorgeous and good looking.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, you didn't.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You want
to create contrast.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: The more contrast,
the more challenged, the more

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.022 align:middle line:90%
opportunity, the more growth.

00:51:33.022 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if everybody just
loved you wherever you went

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and you won the lottery every
weekend, your life would suck.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And so you
designed it so that you

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.780 align:middle line:90%
can achieve certain marks.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's no purpose other
than seeing what will happen.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.767 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You think-- you
think your life would really

00:51:48.767 --> 00:51:51.490 align:middle line:84%
suck if every weekend
you won the lottery?

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I think
it would be boring.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
be really boring.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having moved into a life
with far greater wealth than I

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.160 align:middle line:84%
was ever exposed to growing
up, I can tell you--

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:90%
and many can tell you--

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.930 align:middle line:90%
that it's not all that.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:90%
What did Jim Carrey say?

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.573 align:middle line:84%
I wish everybody could
make $20 million--

00:52:11.573 --> 00:52:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and lose it.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: --and
have everything they

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.880 align:middle line:84%
ever wanted so that they
could see that that's not

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:90%
what life's about.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just like,
immediately other things

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:90%
fill your periphery.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Other awarenesses,
other shortcomings.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I didn't know,
and I could do better.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.582 align:middle line:84%
And then you immediately
grow in other directions.

00:52:27.582 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you were just winning
the lottery and everybody loved

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:90%
you, you would not be growing.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You wouldn't grow.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:32.603 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't evolve.

00:52:32.603 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: You'd be boring.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What you said about
reincarnation was interesting.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:41.630 align:middle line:84%
About it's an illusion because
it's not linear anyway.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Explain that and how it pertains
to thoughts becoming things.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Ah.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, so the best way
to talk about time

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.970 align:middle line:84%
is to fess up that it's
real when you're in it.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.377 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's real when you're in it.

00:52:53.377 --> 00:52:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It feels that way.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's illusionary,
but so is our whole life.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So is the whole adventure.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It's illusionary.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But the more real it seems, the
more fear, and the more desire,

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the more passion, and
the deeper the love.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, by fleetingly
believing in the lies of now

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:84%
versus later versus past
versus future versus here

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.290 align:middle line:84%
versus there versus
have versus have not--

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.780 align:middle line:84%
all lies, made possible
by time and space.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But by fleetingly buying that
ticket that we've talked about,

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
you can all of a
sudden be gripped

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
with passion that
would not otherwise

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.450 align:middle line:84%
exist if you knew that you lived
forever, if you kind of felt

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:33.310 align:middle line:84%
all of the infinite
possibilities that

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:90%
were swirling around you.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So by eating of the
forbidden fruit, which

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is what we do by thinking
that time, space, and matter,

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.670 align:middle line:90%
or the apple was real--

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the original sin-- we are all
of a sudden on this journey,

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on this adventure that's
made possible by those lies.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
piercing the illusion.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not about walking on water.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.060 align:middle line:84%
We came from that place where it
was all like, ha, ha, ha, smoke

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and mirrors.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're like, oh my
gosh, it's so real.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:01.900 align:middle line:90%
I want this.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I need you.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't need you.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And that passion,
that emotion is

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the juice that comes from
believing in these illusions.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And that make it possible to
feel like love isn't there

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:15.910 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it is
there all the time.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But by thinking it's
not there all the time,

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I want it
there all the time.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And then I fall in love.

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I feel love in a
way that I couldn't

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.320 align:middle line:84%
feel when it's just
showering upon me

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.620 align:middle line:84%
in greater realms than
where we came from.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.350 align:middle line:84%
To be here, we deny
ourselves that awareness.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And so game on.

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And then it's a linear game.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've got to
abide by the rules.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And so we believe in time.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll say in
one breath that all

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.853 align:middle line:84%
of these leaves on the trees
are happening simultaneously.

00:54:45.853 --> 00:54:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
implication that one life

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:49.000 align:middle line:90%
will lead to the next life.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.458 align:middle line:84%
Which, I was aware
that I did that.

00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:52.833 align:middle line:84%
And somebody might be watching
saying, but wait a minute.

00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:90%
You just said there's none.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, just as
there's no such thing

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.740 align:middle line:84%
as a time in the grander
scheme of things,

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.270 align:middle line:84%
when you're living
a life, it's very

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.320 align:middle line:90%
real inside that little bubble.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:90%
It feels like it.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And when
you buy the ticket

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of a series of lifetimes, if
you will-- we'll call it that.

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to be all those leaves
on that tree over there

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.160 align:middle line:90%
in that meadow.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's still going
to be the appearance

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and the sensation of time and
the illusion of a lifetime that

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.360 align:middle line:84%
preceded this lifetime
and the lifetime that

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.470 align:middle line:90%
will follow that lifetime.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, all those lifetimes
are happening simultaneously

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.770 align:middle line:84%
in a way that the brain is
not wired to understand.

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And each of them is
believing in different pasts

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and in different futures.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And the linear lie is
that we have one past.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.260 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
have multiple futures.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.780 align:middle line:90%
It depends on your decisions.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:48.220 align:middle line:84%
You also equally
have multiple pasts.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Parallels and probabilities that
each one of you think you're

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:53.620 align:middle line:90%
the only one.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's so multidimensional
it fries the brain.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The brain was not designed
to ride those waves.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Figure out this lifetime,
this here and now.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go back to all

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:10.470 align:middle line:84%
of the other realms and
possibilities and awarenesses.

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:12.220 align:middle line:84%
What's most important
for every lifetime--

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.780 align:middle line:84%
while it's fun to
smoke on those ideas--

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.135 align:middle line:84%
what's most important
is joy here and now.

00:56:19.135 --> 00:56:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It actually goes
hand-in-hand with the thoughts

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.740 align:middle line:90%
becoming things.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Because those thoughts, they
can be happening simultaneously

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:31.660 align:middle line:84%
in the divine in the right
order that need to happen.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.480 align:middle line:90%
They could ignite.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:90%
They could go away.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.560 align:middle line:90%
You could change your mind.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's
realizing that when

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:40.180 align:middle line:84%
you have that vision of
travel partner with benefits,

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it exists in another
realm right now.

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:43.920 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And that might sound
like a stretch.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And it might not be as
fleshed out as this.

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.550 align:middle line:90%
But that reality becomes real.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter
of merging this now

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.760 align:middle line:84%
with that desired now, done
so through the mechanics

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:90%
we've been speaking of.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The details, the
visualization, the baby steps,

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:02.590 align:middle line:90%
knocking on doors.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:03.423 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All of that.

00:57:03.423 --> 00:57:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And that's how
thoughts become things.

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.300 align:middle line:90%
They spontaneously exist.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But we need to merge the nows.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in your journey,
19 years now of doing this--

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how much
longer you're going to do it.

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
driving force in you.

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.490 align:middle line:84%
What is that why
where you continue

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.460 align:middle line:90%
to do this day in, day out?

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.915 align:middle line:90%
It seems like you have fun.

00:57:25.915 --> 00:57:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: I do, I do.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:34.140 align:middle line:84%
That why has been me,
really, I have to say.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And that may come off wrong.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I really believe divine
selfishness is the ticket.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when we take
care of ourselves,

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.170 align:middle line:84%
we shine our light
the brightest.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Our light will illuminate
the darkened paths of others.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I really believe it's a
sacred responsibility--

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.050 align:middle line:84%
not to make a job out of
it-- to follow our hearts,

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and to live our dreams,
and to be as grand as we're

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:90%
capable of being.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we will most
enrich the rest of the world.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's been kind
of my driving thing

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.380 align:middle line:90%
until my daughter was born.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And now more than
ever, me includes her.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I would also further define
divine selfishness as one

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.490 align:middle line:84%
in which you automatically care
about other people and those

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.290 align:middle line:90%
you love.

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, selfishness-- gaining
at the expense of others

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.760 align:middle line:90%
is not selfishnessness.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.270 align:middle line:90%
That's stupidity.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're automatically
caring about other people.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But having a daughter, as
I do now-- she's five--

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:34.380 align:middle line:90%
is my why.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's never to
the exclusion of me.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I still honor the
drummer within.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I still find plenty of time to
be my unique God expression.

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But her joy, her laughter,
her little voice, her future

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.530 align:middle line:90%
just is such a why.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It definitely takes
over, doesn't it?

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.070 align:middle line:84%
You just get smitten
with the love.

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And especially as pure as
they are when they're young.

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible experience.

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.820 align:middle line:84%
To be conscious about
it is also neat.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But I love that you called
that divine selfishness.

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.086 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
that term before.

00:59:16.086 --> 00:59:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Divine selfishness,
yeah, divinely selfish.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I really would
run the other way.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Raised a Catholic.

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I am not one today.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.800 align:middle line:90%
All due respect.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.230 align:middle line:84%
To me, the doctrine was
always to be selfless,

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to put the needs of
others before your own.

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:36.270 align:middle line:84%
God didn't come here to be Mike
Dooley so that he could honor

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:38.260 align:middle line:90%
everyone else and their needs.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.060 align:middle line:90%
That's not living.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not life.

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was a while--

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it was in the last
15 years that I

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:47.080 align:middle line:84%
realized that I could be
of service, and again,

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.030 align:middle line:90%
in a selfish way.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I could do it my
way when I wanted.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.640 align:middle line:10%
Through my website, we've raised
$1.5 million for charities.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.920 align:middle line:10%
And I've given a
large chunk of that.

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.580 align:middle line:10%
And I have found speaking in
jails and prisons and shelters

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:04.560 align:middle line:10%
that it is so rewarding to
kind of plant a seed of hope,

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.120 align:middle line:10%
reaching those who
have not yet been

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.230 align:middle line:10%
reached with the kind
of truths that I share.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.412 align:middle line:90%
That we are divine creators.

01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:10.620 align:middle line:90%
That you're not being judged.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.662 align:middle line:90%
That it's going to be OK.

01:00:11.662 --> 01:00:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That God, the universe--

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.298 align:middle line:84%
I'll use whatever
words they need--

01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:15.630 align:middle line:90%
loves you and adores you.

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And you're needed in the world.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.960 align:middle line:90%
We want you here.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And to hear them
say, Mr. Dooley,

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard anything like
that before in my whole life.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yeah, score.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Because one day, that thought is
going to grow into a beanstalk,

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
into a transformed life
that will touch more lives.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Service is the coolest
thing in the world.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
ready, on your terms.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, this was awesome.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's life changing.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You can really, truly live
your life this way 100%.

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't let those other thoughts
come in and cancel it out.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for teaching us
how thoughts become things.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's been a
great honor to be with you.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.313 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My honor, honestly.

01:01:00.313 --> 01:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for being with me.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.670 align:middle line:10%
It is my honor to
have you join me.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.920 align:middle line:10%

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

invite you to stay aware.
