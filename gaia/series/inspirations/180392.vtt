Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, and joining
me is psychologist and founder

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
of the RavenHeart Center for
Regression Therapy, Dr. Linda

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Backman.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Backman has more than 40
years of experience assisting

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
people through past life,
or what she calls spiritual,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:10%
regression to help
people understand

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:10%
their life's purpose.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Backman is also the
author of three books

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:10%

>>DR. LINDA BACKMAN:
Thank you, Lisa,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mine, too.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:84%
I am so excited about
this conversation.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So, tell me why you chose
past life regression

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
therapy as opposed to a
traditional psychology.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: In a
way, it chose me.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was a conventional
psychologist

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
for about 15 years in
private practice doing

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
what you would imagine a
general psychologist does.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:10%
I was very interested
and did a lot of death,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:10%
dying, and grief
counseling back then.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:10%
I didn't really understand why
until I fell into this work.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Then, I had a
colleague die, and I

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
had some very surprising--
back then, surprising to me--

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:90%
spiritual experiences.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so today, I really believe
I agreed to do this work,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:90%
but it happened.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.749 align:middle line:84%
And I chose it because
I found it fascinating.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What were
the experiences you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
had when the colleague died?

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Share that with us.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, so my
colleague was a man 14 years

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
younger than I.
Together, we had built

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
a group, private
practice, of psychologists

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and psychiatrists.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'd just retire
one day and hand the practice

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:90%
over to him.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, he was diagnosed
at the age of about 31

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
with a serious type
of lung cancer.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And 18 months later, the
cancer took his life,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
which of course, from a human
perspective, was extremely sad.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
what happened when

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
he passed, within
about a day, I started

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
having spiritual experiences.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, back then, I didn't
know whether I believed

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
in reincarnation or I didn't.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.526 align:middle line:90%
I'd read a book.

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to do with it.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I, apparently, wasn't ready.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
He passed and,
basically, what happened

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
for me is that I began to
feel his energy all around me.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I began to intuit him
communicating to me.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
was kind of weird.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite know
what to do with it.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see scenes in
my mind's eye of past lives

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that I believed I'd
shared with him.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, you know,
either I need my own therapist

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
or I need my own medication
or whatever, which I knew I--

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.295 align:middle line:90%
you know, I knew what--

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how
did you know it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a part of your
grieving process?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.092 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I just knew.

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
the thing when you

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:90%
fall into this kind of work.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It had never happened
to me before.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd had other grief
processes before.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%
I'd never had those experiences.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.622 align:middle line:84%
And simply, another
step I took, which

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
really made a big
difference to me,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
is I asked my
husband to sit down.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
We'd never talked
about reincarnation.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.389 align:middle line:84%
Both of us have
graduate degrees.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
we'd never discussed

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of things.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I asked him to sit down.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.915 align:middle line:84%
I explained to him
what was going on.

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he'd
just look back at me

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, honey, there, there.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:10%
There's just something
weird going on.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:10%
But he didn't, Lisa, and he
looked back at me very calmly.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.184 align:middle line:10%
And I said to my
husband, I said,

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:10%
you don't think this
is strange, do you?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, why not?

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, only now do
I remember that as a boy,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
he said, I remembered
my past lives in detail.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I knew they were past lives.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
He had never told me this,
because he'd repressed it.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:90%
So it was like permission.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like he said,
if you're interested in this,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
go for it, which,
obviously, I did.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you identify
past lives from just

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:90%
an active imagination?

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because
the past lives

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
explain something
in current life.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the past lives
have a direct connection

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
to life today.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They explain something
we're working on

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to change in life today,
which is what we call karma.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
They also can explain
a relationship,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:90%
a phobia, a physical symptom.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The unexplained, right?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Stuff that we
just can't make sense of.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So is that the soul
evolving, essentially,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
as we go through lifetime
to lifetime to lifetime?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.194 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're attempting
to do, is evolve as a soul?

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, what
I've come to understand,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
after 25 years of guiding
clients-- where I don't give

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
them the information, they give
it to me-- along with mentors

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd had, is that the soul
is required to evolve.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like,
as a soul, we're

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
required to come into body,
and we're required to learn.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And learning isn't easy.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So we gather karma, and
we also gather dharma.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.409 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're working
on in our current life.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the difference
between karma and dharma?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Karma, as most people know
is a freewill decision

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
we made in a past life that
perhaps wasn't the best

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
decision.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not a permanent
black mark on your soul.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can
balance in a subsequent life.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.217 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if you were
a neglectful parent.

00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it
always have to be bad?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.175 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it
always have to be

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:90%
something that wasn't resolved?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Could it be good?

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.443 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's
what dharma is.

00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: So that's perfect.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.543 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you're
asking it exactly--

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
a great distinction.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.441 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --exactly like that.

00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a decision
that wasn't preferable.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be something horrible

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and deep and dark and dangerous.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
But dharma means soul intention.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So at times, when
I'm guiding a client,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
their guides choose to
show them not karma.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So that isn't always what
comes up in a past life.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's dharma,
because that's what

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:90%
we accomplished in a past life.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know
we've accomplished it,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
because in life today,
we don't believe we have.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we want to,
as a soul, figure it out,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
unravel it, get to the next
step, make sense of it,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and that's why we reincarnate?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Probably?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So the misnomer
that most people have

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we grow
at the soul level

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:90%
you might say between lives.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Or we grow as a soul
because our soul

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
resides in the spiritual realm.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
We basically evolve in
body, not out of body.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So in order to grow-- it's
sort of like in order to learn,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:90%
you have to go to school.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to evolve, you
have to come into body,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and then make choices based on--

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
you have a life plan,
life intentions.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.227 align:middle line:84%
And then, you basically
come in with free will.

00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you would think
that it makes more sense

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to evolve in a
lifetime, because you

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
have people and relationships
and other things

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
to bounce off of
to help you grow.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: As a spirit,
you wouldn't know.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.635 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
know all this is valid?

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:24.932 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's
a great question.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
People ask me that all the time.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I know it's valid based
on when I guide clients--

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and I've been getting clients
almost week in and week out

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
for 25 years--

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I hear similar things, like
what happens when we die.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Like we have spiritual guides
and spiritual guidance.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't give the
clients the information.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They speak the information
during the regression.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like doing research.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a case
study method research.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
When I've heard it 10 times
or 15 times or 25 times,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.269 align:middle line:90%
it's like it must be valid.

00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are
some of those themes

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that you hear over and
over again in regressions?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: A classic one comes
to mind when you say that.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Often, a client
goes to a past life.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They have a
challenging experience.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:90%
They have a loss through death.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:84%
They had a loss
of a relationship.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:90%
They have a physical challenge.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And they cave into it.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
They cave into it and live
out the rest of their lives

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
in depression or
live out the rest

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of their lives kind
of hiding away and not

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:90%
having much of a life.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the
guides that coordinate

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the higher realm,
if you will, that

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:90%
is not what they want us to do.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They want us to take
on the challenge

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how
to grow and evolve

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
with that intrusion,
that challenge.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with it?

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we make it something
positive versus taking us down?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.427 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this why you
created the RavenHeart Center?

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, the
RavenHeart Center

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
came out of the
segue, the bridge,

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
where it was like, oh
my gosh, do I give up

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:90%
conventional psychology?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.624 align:middle line:84%
Will I ever get
a referral again?

00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Back when I was doing
conventional work,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
most of my referrals came
from medical doctors.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like when I fell into
the spiritual work, I thought,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, I'll just
get, if you will,

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
washed out of the profession.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:90%
That isn't what happened.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So the RavenHeart Center
came out of the bridge of I'm

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
going to get brave
enough to follow my heart

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and follow my passion and
let go of conventional work.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:10%
How long into it did
you make that decision?

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I was
about three years

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
into discovering
this spiritual work.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh,
I was frightened.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
People said, you might
lose your license.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.795 align:middle line:90%
I never lost my license.

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like the tagline.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It says, a mystery school for
the advancement of the soul.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, in days gone
by, back in ancient Egypt,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
there were mystery schools
where people studied the soul.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, we can
have modern-day mystery schools.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's about who
are we as a soul?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Why do we come into body?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Why do good things
happen to-- you

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
know, why do bad things
happen to good people?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's
such a big question.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: What is the point?

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.682 align:middle line:90%
There is a point.

00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is something
associated with the school

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:90%
called Raven Social Action.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And I love that
you've asked me that question.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So, as we evolve
as a soul, we have

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to be active participants
on the planet.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just about
balancing our karma

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:90%
and embracing our dharma.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's about what we do
actively in our life?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So Raven Social
Action really relates

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:90%
to pick your favorite cause.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Pick your local Humane Society.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Pick one of the progressive
organizations on the planet.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Donate your time donate
your money or do both.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Become active participants
to move humanity forward.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's what Raven
Social Action is.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you had a
past life experience, maybe,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Holocaust, you
would then volunteer

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
at a Holocaust organization
or a museum or something

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:90%
like that, right?

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people think,
well, the action has to be big.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It has to be lots of
money or lots of time.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It can be promote organic
gardening in your neighborhood.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But do something that
progresses our human culture.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it help unravel
or maybe heal that past life,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
do you think?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes?

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.664 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, that is a
wonderful way to look at it.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, because then we become--

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like
it heals that theme.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to that
theme that we talked about,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
it heals the theme of
don't cave in and just

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
sit home and don't be active,
an active participant.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Do something literal.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
what is past life regression.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
What is the experience
that someone goes through?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.993 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, the
first thing that people

00:12:10.993 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
worry about, the common
worry is, oh, it's hypnosis.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:90%
What is hypnosis?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:90%
People misunderstand hypnosis.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis, very
simply, is relaxation.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis is where we take
ourselves every day of our life

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
when we relax ourselves.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So if we're doing
something left-brained,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
the cycles per second of our
brain are at the fastest speed.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
When we naturally relax,
take a walk, listen to music,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
go in the kitchen and even
begin to cook, or something

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
like that, the cycles per
second of our brain slow down.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Our right brain, our intuitive
activity in our brain,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
becomes more, if
you will, lit up.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what I guide people
to access in regression work.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.446 align:middle line:84%
So I use breathing, guided
imagery, and metaphor.

00:12:56.446 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It surprises people how
easy it is to access

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
the first scene in a past life.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's the job of a
trained regression therapist

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to know how to open it
up, how to ask questions,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
how to deepen it.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But also, it moves
forward spontaneously.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't give the
information to the client.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
They tell me the information.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you start
with the regression--

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been through this
before with someone else.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, as you drift
off and you're in this state,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:84%
now, open your eyes
and look at your feet.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
That was where this
person started.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a specific
starting point?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have a model.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I train people in this
work, but I have a model.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the first steps,
and I do two things with that.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I say, I want you to imagine
that you can see your feet.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But I also add in, I
want you to imagine

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that if you can't see your
feet, you can touch your feet.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.751 align:middle line:84%
Because intuition
also works for touch.

00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So immediately,
you will see

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
sandals or dirt or something.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll ask the
person to look around you.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I ask very simple things
like, is it hot or cold

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
or just a comfortable
temperature?

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you sense you're
alone or not alone?

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little, tiny questions
that the client couldn't

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:90%
make up the details.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:84%
As they begin to
describe the scene,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.401 align:middle line:84%
it becomes extremely
detailed, far more detailed.

00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I say to the client when
we're finished, unless you're

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.574 align:middle line:84%
a famous novelist, I don't think
you could have made this up.

00:14:33.574 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, and
it links, usually,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:90%
with historical facts, right?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It links with facts
and also, in particular, it

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
links with the
client's current life.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.606 align:middle line:84%
It needs to explain something
about their own life.

00:14:45.606 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they
come in saying, I

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
have this issue
with a relationship,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:84%
or I have a problem with my
money, or whatever it is,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and you'll find it?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.971 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like clues in the past.

00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at Linda's
story of her own past life

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Now I don't believe
that everybody is supposed

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:10%
to have children,
because that's not--

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:10%
based on what I know, we're
not all scripted in every life

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:10%
to be a mother or father.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:10%
But if the reason you
don't have children

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:10%
is because it felt too
scary, you almost, for sure,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:10%
had a child die in a past life.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:10%
Almost for sure.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:10%
That's what brought
me, actually,

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:39.370 align:middle line:10%
into the field of psychology,
is 41 or 42 years ago, Earl

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and I were pregnant
with our second child.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:10%
We have two living children.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:10%
We were pregnant with
our second child.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:10%
That's a baby that
was born at six

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:10%
months or 26 weeks of an
average 40-week pregnancy.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:10%
We were 25 and 26 years old.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:10%
It, obviously, was
a long time ago.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:10%
And that baby lived a
short time and passed.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:10%
Changed my life.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:10%
Was it hard back then?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh, probably one of the
hardest experiences of my life.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:10%
Did it change me?

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Yes, because I ended
up in psychotherapy.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.756 align:middle line:10%
And then I became fascinated
with the grief process.

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:10%
And then I started
working with parents

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:10%
who'd had a child die,
because a lot of people

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:10%
are afraid to do
that kind of work.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:10%
It was scripted.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:10%
It was on my journey
for a reason.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:10%
I now know that I've had at
least one past life where

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:10%
I was a crummy mother, where
I was a into my own thing

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:10%
kind of mother.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:10%


00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:10%
And I needed to
experience what it

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:10%
was like to, as we say, in
general language, lose a child.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.060 align:middle line:10%
So I lost a child.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was so
important to talk about,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
challenging to understand

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:84%
the loss of a child, and
especially a newborn.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
manage the pain of it?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you did explain it
through the regression part.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment, how
did you manage that?

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
Lisa, I was young.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:90%
I was 25.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:10%
I knew nothing about what
we're talking about today.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I was 25 years old.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
This content that we're talking
about was not there in my head.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't understand it.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So how I dealt
with it back then,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:84%
long story, but I ended up
in a psychiatrist's office.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I ended up on
anti-depressant medication.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing wrong
with any of that,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to
say that at all.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I had to dig
in and understand my feelings.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually what led me
to become a psychologist.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't spiritual, so
that's an important piece.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But I found I had to work
on understanding myself.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I stopped
taking the medication

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and stopped seeing the
psychiatrist, who simply wanted

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to give me medication,
and found a therapist

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
where I could work on me.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But I became fascinated with
death, dying, and grieving.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It's why I did--

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what started it.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.579 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's why
I did that years ago

00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:24.788 align:middle line:90%
as a conventional psychology.

00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:25.587 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering why
you started with that.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense now.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So you discovered this
later, and then you

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:90%
went on to have another child.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You have two healthy children
today, adult children today.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
How can you use
past life regression

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to understand if you have
an issue with a child

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
or an ornery child or a child
that you can't understand?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they say, oh, I
didn't raise this child.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not mine.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have two twins who are
identical twins with completely

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:90%
different behavior.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.797 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that through
past life regression?

00:18:57.797 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the first thing I
would automatically say to you

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:10%
is that if you're the
parent and there's a child,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:10%
you made an agreement
at the soul level

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:10%
to be parent and child.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You came together for a reason.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that mean, if you
know that, it makes it easy?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Then, you need to
go back and track

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:90%
what happened in the past.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
What are the relationships
you had in the past?

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
That child might have
been your mother.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
That child might have
been your husband.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
What happened in that
relationship in the past that

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:90%
is showing up in life today?

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And once the client understands
the content of the past,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
then they basically
have the tools

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:90%
to work with it in the present.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have that
experience with my daughter.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even go through a
regression to figure this out,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
but we learned
that she and I were

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
separated at a very early age.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And she and I were
separated in the Holocaust.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was literally
a scene that we

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.174 align:middle line:90%
shared with each other--

00:20:04.174 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember, when she was young
and she was in the bathtub,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
and we were talking.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was the way that I
reached my hand over to her

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that we were
ripped away from each other,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and she watched my death.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said this out
loud, and she was seven.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we just started crying,
because it was such a visceral

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:90%
feeling-- it still is--

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of being ripped
away from my child.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And I always have
such an empathy,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because I can't imagine anything
worse than losing a child.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
because it happened.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And we have such a bond today.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Even when I leave to travel,
it's like an immediate,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to miss you.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like that lights up
in the strangest of ways.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with that in
this lifetime, where sometimes

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't go well and you have
such a bad relationship, where

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:90%
it's constantly igniting?

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.507 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least we have a
good feeling of being together.

00:21:08.507 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think that's
the beauty of regression work.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like a key in a lock.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:10%
It's like if you didn't
know about that past life,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:10%
then you don't have the content
to understand the feelings.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
for so many of us

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
is we beat up on ourselves
for the feelings.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we know where
they come from,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
then I think we can more easily
work on beating up on ourself.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a similar issue with one
of my children, who was also

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:90%
with me in the Holocaust.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was my baby brother,
and I was separated from him

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and taken to a camp.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
my children of today.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And when my son went to study
in Europe, my son of today,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:10%
I was a wreck.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But then I discovered--
some years later,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
actually-- that he was my young
brother that was off at school

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
on the day my house
was stormed in Paris

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:90%
when I was a Jew in Paris.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw
my brother again,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and I adored my baby brother.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
That is my son of today.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were unadjustedly
upset when he went to college?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
a mess for months.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm anticipating
that day now,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's like four years.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: But you have content.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%
That makes a difference.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I had no content.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can really
look to those past lives.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what we're
creating today that's going

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
to impact our future lives.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: What I believe
we are doing is, to me,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that is what is the purpose
of coming into body,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
is to balance our karma
and embrace our dharma.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that, I
really believe, Lisa,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that we contribute to,
we impact our future.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We impact our individual
future, but we impact our,

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.951 align:middle line:84%
you might say, group
humanity future.

00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mentioned
in the beginning

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:84%
about this impacting
people's life purpose.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And really helping them
either cement into that

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
or discover what that is our
change directions completely.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you share an example of
how that happened with someone?

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They really discovered
their life purpose

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:90%
through regression.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.191 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I could share either
about me or about a client,

00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that's what happened

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:90%
to me when my colleague passed.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And my colleague
started talking to me,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and I became fascinated
with reincarnation.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd be a
general psychologist

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life, the
rest of my working life.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I never dreamed I'd be
doing what I'm doing today.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Most psychologists
don't do what I do.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people will say,
don't you worry about that?

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And I don't.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
When we understand
our life purpose--

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and people will ask me,
clients will ask me, well,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
how do I can figure
out my life purpose?

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I do spiritual counseling,
as well as a regression.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, what are
you passionate about?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What really turns on
the juices in you?

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
What turns on our juices is
what we're meant to be doing,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
no matter whether it's growing
a garden that you've never

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.627 align:middle line:84%
grown before or doing what
you do or doing what I do.

00:24:16.627 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what about a client?

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Have they changed?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Have you had people completely
change directions, careers?

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, many times.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
People who've been an attorney
their whole life, but they've

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%
always wanted to be an artist.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And they've always had these
sort of under-the-rug sort

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:90%
of artistic abilities.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want to
own it because perhaps

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.034 align:middle line:84%
something happened to them
as the artist in a past life.

00:24:43.034 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
a relationship,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
where someone realizes that
this is the person they're not

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be with because
something happened in the past?

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I love that you're
asking me that question.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a common theme.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is that
we come into body--

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
we often connect with
someone that we're

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.882 align:middle line:90%
meant to clean up karma with.

00:25:01.882 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be a marriage.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It could just be
a number of years

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:90%
of a romantic relationship.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:90%
We clean up the karma.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we're meant to
stay with them our whole life.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And at times, I help
clients understand

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
making that decision, based
on learning about past lives.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
At times, people stay with
that original partner.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
At other times, they've
completed the contract.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The contract is over,
and they're only

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
going to find that much more
comfortable relationship

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
by letting go of what they
cleaned up so they can move

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:84%
on to what really
is in store for them

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in a very positive
way that's coming

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
in another relationship or
a type of work or whatever.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.874 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you go
into divorce court

00:25:43.874 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I had a past life
with him when I was his mother,

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.498 align:middle line:90%
and I'm done with that?

00:25:47.498 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how does that go?

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I don't.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Have I done that in my
old psychologist life?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Do the expert witness
thing, yes, I've done that.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's an
interesting question.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I've never considered that.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:84%
But I hope people
make that decision.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I, of course, don't tell
them what decision to make.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:90%
It's their choice.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:90%
But they gain information.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
It helps them know
the reason they

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
need to move on in
their life and let go

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:90%

an eye surgery, right?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you said that it helped

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of the eye surgery
by understanding the past life.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It demystifies the current--

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
or it takes the fear
out of the experience

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:90%
if you really understand it.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It
takes the fear out,

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.712 align:middle line:84%
and it gives it a
grounding in logic.

00:26:42.712 --> 00:26:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's a
really important point, too,

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
you do or what I do.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It's that we need to be
balanced left and right brained.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So we get, sometimes, emotional
content from a past life.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But then we work with
it in our left brain

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:84%
to gain an understanding
of, oh, this

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is why I'm having to go
through this challenge.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:90%
This challenge is purposeful.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going to lead me to a
different level of evolution

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of who I am as a soul.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, take something,
for example, like cancer.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
at why you might have a breast
cancer and there was an injury?

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen that
actually regress cancer?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I
guess I would say

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about a
particular client I'm

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:84%
working with right now, that she
has a breast cancer diagnosis.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:84%
She totally believes it's not
about dying from the cancer.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
She believes it's about taking
some new steps in her life

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and, you might say,
furthering her soul evolution.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:90%
So she's approaching it--

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying she doesn't
have any fear at all.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But she's approaching
it from how is this

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
going to take me further
up the ladder of my life?

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And so far, she's
doing beautifully,

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors are
pleased with her progress.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And could there be someone
maybe has throat cancer

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:90%
and they went through a hanging?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
found that to be true?

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.407 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:28:16.407 --> 00:28:17.698 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely a possibility.

00:28:17.698 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And once they've looked
and healed that lifetime, it

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.860 align:middle line:90%
starts to resolve?

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Are there guarantees?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But yes, can we, at times,
discover what's that past life

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
issue and can it
literally affect our body

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and then, you might
say, disaffect our body?

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.217 align:middle line:90%
It can.

00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really important
for people to understand.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about soul groups.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Do we incarnate with
a group of people

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.440 align:middle line:90%
that we've been with before?

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, people might say,
well, how does Linda know this?

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I know this from client
after client after client,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:84%
where what they
come upon, at times,

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
at the soul level
of a regression,

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
is a group of souls with whom
they incarnate repetitively.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So simply put, I like
to call it a soul pod.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
A soul pod means most of us have
about 10 to 20 souls with whom

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:90%
we incarnate most often.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean they're
all in our current life?

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Probably all 10 to
20 are not with us.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But it also explains
relationships,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
like why do I feel so
drawn to this person?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's because we've known
them over and over and over.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So would it
be a family member?

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it usually family?

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it usually parents, siblings?

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: No.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: No.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It is usually about
three different things.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It is usually blood family,
someone you would call family

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're not blood, someone
who either mentored you or was

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:90%
a successor of yours.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you mentored them.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to be sure that
everybody hears this piece.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
It is also your adversaries.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:10%
It is people with whom,
at the soul level,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:10%
you agreed to push each others
buttons for the sake of soul

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:10%
evolution.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So it can be I have a sibling
who is one of my adversaries.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:90%
It's all about my learning.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all about his learning.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you approach
the relationship

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:90%
differently knowing that?

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I do.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 100%, right?

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.721 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I don't know
that I can speak for him,

00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
but yes, because
it explains, oh, I

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
know what happened
in a past life.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I know why we came into body
and why I push your buttons,

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:90%
you push my buttons.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It gives me, again, that
left brain content that

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
helps explain the
right brain struggle,

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%
the emotional struggle.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you don't
get so frustrated?

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.552 align:middle line:84%
You anticipate situations,
you're not shocked by them?

00:30:49.552 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
You know what's going
to happen, kind of?

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It sort of
gives it a grounding

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
that it never had before.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It takes away I won't
say 100% of the angst.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But it takes away
a lot of the angst

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I keep
using the word content,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:90%
but it gives content.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.537 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When we were talking
about the souls as a spirit,

00:31:09.537 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
it hangs out in the
spirit realm for a while

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and then goes back
into the body.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Is there a between
life regression or a

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.824 align:middle line:84%
between life experience that
you're talking about there?

00:31:21.824 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Two things.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.025 align:middle line:84%
Probably two answers
to what you're asking.

00:31:25.025 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's important
for everybody to know,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
when we come into
body, we bring a slice

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of our soul or an aspect
or a fractal of our soul

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
into body to cause us
to be alive at birth.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:84%
The remainder of our
soul is our higher self.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're always in body
and in soul, in spirit,

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's our higher self.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I guide a type of
regression called

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:90%
between lives regression.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:10%
The only reason it's
called that is we

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:10%
work at the soul
level of the client.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Between
lives regression?

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So, I call it between
life soul regression.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It was originally written about
by a mentor of mine whose name

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:90%
is Dr. Michael Newton.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:90%
He wrote about it years ago.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
He's passed and
on the other side.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It's regression where I go
the client into past life.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We move we move through the
past life scene by scene.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:90%
We go to the death scene.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the client
doesn't literally

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're dying,
but they experience

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:90%
what caused their death.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They experience who was
there, who wasn't there.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:90%
That's all very important.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we work at the
soul level of the client,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:84%
because they follow
their journey back

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:90%
into the spiritual realm.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:90%
We work with guides.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We work with how they
planned their current life.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We work with guidance from
their guides about present life.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's soul level work,
not just past life work.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what we
went through as a soul

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to get ready to incarnate
now, the fractal

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:90%
that we bring with us?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.136 align:middle line:90%
It's very confusing.

00:32:59.136 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It's always hard
to explain this.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like what
people often don't

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
think about is our soul
is in spirit at all times,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
whether we're incarnate or not.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But when we're incarnate,
I can guide a regression,

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and the client then works
at their soul level,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
understanding possibly
more past life material,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:84%
but also understanding
current life explanation.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Usually, spiritual
guides show up.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual guides are
the conduit, you might say.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:35.682 align:middle line:84%
Clients connect with that
guidance that we all have.

00:33:35.682 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually
have video here

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
of talking about this
between life regression.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.750 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: This is
a female client,

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:10%
fictitiously named Arlene.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:10%
She says, in the
past life, she says,

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.460 align:middle line:10%
I have an argument with my
husband about our daughter.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:10%
I go to my room and cry.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm not happy with myself.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.340 align:middle line:10%
I want to be more loving
and show affection better.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:10%
I've made a mess of things
and feel very alone.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.980 align:middle line:10%
Some years later, I'm
in bed sick and dying.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:10%
I feel sick at heart.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:10%
My husband is here.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:10%
He does care for me.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:10%
He is sad.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:10%
He regrets the lack of
love in our marriage,

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:10%
as do I. How can two people
so alike be so far apart?

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.650 align:middle line:10%
It's all my fault.
Life didn't go OK.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.020 align:middle line:10%
I have made others miserable.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:10%
I tell him I'm sorry,
and he understands.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:10%
I've wasted a life
and messed up.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:10%
I've kept too much inside of me.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:10%
I did not accomplish much.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.400 align:middle line:10%
I had to marry and
felt guilty about it.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:10%
My daughter was deaf.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.199 align:middle line:10%
She loved her
father more than me.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:10%
Then, the client dies.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm going higher.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.670 align:middle line:10%
I cannot see my body any longer.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:10%
It's dark all around.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Now I feel like
I'm being pulled.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:10%
I relax and just let it happen.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm in a clearing.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:10%
It's getting lighter.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:10%
This feels very relaxing.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm stretched out.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:10%
Now I see where
I'm supposed to be.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm coming into a globe or
a dome of sorts, with points

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.460 align:middle line:10%
all around it.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:10%
This looks like countryside.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:10%
There's intelligent energy here.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:10%
I see familiar
people smiling at me.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:10%
There's a big building
with steps going up.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:10%
I can go in, but I want to just
wait and relax on the grass.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:10%
We're allowed to move at
whatever speed we choose.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:10%
Now there are a lot
of friends coming.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:10%
Some look human,
and others do not.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:10%
I recognize only some of them.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Now my husband and daughter
are coming toward me.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:10%
Husband and daughter
from current life.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And so, parentheses,
when we are incarnate,

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:10%
a portion of our
soul energy always

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:10%
remains in the spiritual realm.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:10%
This is labeled as our higher
self or our superconscious.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:10%
So that's how the
husband and the daughter

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:10%
show up in the
time between lives.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:10%
My guide arrives and says, I'm
right here, where I always am.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:10%
I've been here
all along for you.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:10%
I've been guiding you all along.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:10%
My name is Swallow.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:10%
Swallow tells me I had a
bumpy ride in the last life.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:10%
She feels sympathetic, not
angry or disappointed in me.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:10%
She assures me there are
more opportunities ahead.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:10%
She says, do not get
bogged down with shoulds.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:10%
There's more good in the
last life than you think.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:10%
The guilt was so
overwhelming for you

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:10%
that you could not
recognize the good.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:10%
You were so focused on what
you did not like in that life.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:10%
You'll feel better soon.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:10%
It's all OK.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in that
video, the person

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:90%
talked about having a guide.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice that
many people have

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:84%
guides through the
regression and currently?

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, the
bottom line is we all

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:90%
have spiritual guides.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.085 align:middle line:90%
So I have no doubt.

00:37:08.085 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And you know, people can say,
well, how do you know that,

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Linda?

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they show
up spontaneously in

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:90%
regressions all the time.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.569 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like in what form?

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: All forms, actually.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they show up
in a human-seeming form.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're a loved one.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're a
grandmother, a parent,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.960 align:middle line:90%
someone who passed on.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:90%
That can be one of our guides.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
That is almost never
our main guide.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they show
up in energy form.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they show up
as a light, a color.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's just a feel.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just an emotion
that is the trigger

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that our guide is present.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you have guides?

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I talk to
my guides all the time.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: In my head.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I call
cognitive intuition.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a
long time, Lisa,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to learn to trust this, like,
oh, I'm just making this up,

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.440 align:middle line:90%
as clients will say to me, too.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, they give me
guidance in certain cases,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:90%
if I follow it.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.540 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, like, don't talk
to your daughter about that.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, they'll say,
leave that conversation out.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I discover it was
smart to leave it out.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So they just talk
to me in my head.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's more
than your knowing.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really from somewhere else.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Something you wouldn't
really know to do or follow.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes it's
something like I'm

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:84%
inclined to go discuss something
with someone or do something.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm really going to do it.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, my guide
almost says, hang on.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Put on the brakes.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's not the best idea.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
not 100% of the time,

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I follow the suggestion.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I hear this while
I'm driving all the time.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just hear, back off.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And something
inevitably happens,

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:90%
or a speeding car comes around.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's really good
practice to learn to listen.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, and trust.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's another word
in capital letters, is trust.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
and I want

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to find out, as you can talk
about between life regressions,

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.026 align:middle line:84%
can you also talk about
future regression?

00:39:18.026 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I guess you wouldn't
regress into the future,

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:84%
but I had this experience in
a past life regression where

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I saw into a future life.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Is this normal?

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, we
call that progression.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So instead of regression,
we call that progression.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:84%
What I find happens is
when a client of mine

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.530 align:middle line:84%
either spontaneously--
or that's one

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of their goals for
the regression,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.250 align:middle line:84%
they want to get
a sense of what's

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the future.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
about that, Lisa,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is that if our guides show
us progression, future,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
they're showing us
future possibilities.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Our evolution in
life today impacts

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:90%
our future possibilities.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So that the future
isn't set in stone,

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
but how we live our life
today and whether we're

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:84%
working on our karma and our
dharma impacts our future.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we can
gain some insight

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:90%
into future possibilities.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I saw the
way that we lived,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and we lived in these
cities, but they

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:90%
were encapsulated cities.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were big, white kind
of pods, where we could move

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:90%
around, and they were large.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the outside air
was so contaminated,

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
we wound up living in these
kind of sterilized environments.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it was
really interesting,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:48.020 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
lot of teaching that

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.200 align:middle line:84%
would go on throughout
these different pods.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
You can go to a
pod of awareness,

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.067 align:middle line:84%
or you can go to a
pod of community.

00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was connected, and
that was the interesting part

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:90%
about this future.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
this from clients,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that there's future
planets or places?

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Or can you tell us
what you've heard?

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I hear
two things from clients

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:90%
that I think are important.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
One is that there are souls
embodied on Earth today

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that I call
interplanetary souls that

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:90%
primarily don't incarnate here.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.850 align:middle line:84%
They incarnate
elsewhere, and they

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.690 align:middle line:84%
incarnate in, you might say,
healthy celestial locations

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.500 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And they bring their
wisdom with them.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's one answer.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The other answer is,
yes, I have heard,

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:84%
from far more than one client,
that if, in fact, Earth

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't survive--

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that's going
to happen next year, or even

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.846 align:middle line:84%
probably in your
lifetime or my lifetime.

00:41:48.846 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But if, in fact,
Earth doesn't survive,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I have heard spontaneously
from more than one client

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that other locations are being
prepared where life will exist

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and where our souls
will incarnate.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.227 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's valid.

00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:90%
You've heard this before?

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The same situations?

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you find themes
like that happen often?

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Themes of locations.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, history
is able to tell,

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.160 align:middle line:84%
but does that
happen often, where

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:21.224 align:middle line:84%
you're hearing more and more
now of these future locations?

00:42:21.224 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
the best answer

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to that is yes,
because I've heard

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.057 align:middle line:84%
that in recent times, probably
the last three to five years.

00:42:30.057 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And I think that ties
to the struggles that humanity

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:90%
is going through on our planet--

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's real.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --right now.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is real.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And I'll just say
it in maybe a silly way--

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:90%
the jury is still out.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We, as humans, need to
step up and be active.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what social action is
about, active participants.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Or what will happen is
this planet won't survive.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these interplanetary
souls we're talking about,

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:90%
are they here--

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.120 align:middle line:84%
first of all, how
do you identify

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.620 align:middle line:90%
an interplanetary soul?

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.630 align:middle line:90%
You call them IP souls.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, let
me just say briefly,

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.124 align:middle line:84%
just a quick kind of history
of what I've learned about.

00:43:10.124 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Where did the souls
come from that

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:90%
came to Earth to start with?

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So, simplistically,
when Earth began

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to have what we call
Homo sapien life,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is that all the
souls then incarnated on Earth

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.440 align:middle line:90%
came from somewhere else.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They were souls that had
incarnated elsewhere.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.310 align:middle line:84%
They came to Earth
with the agreement

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.560 align:middle line:90%
to assist Earth to evolve.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of those souls
are what I write about

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and I've learned
about their clients

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:90%
are called Earth-based souls.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What that means is they
came from elsewhere,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:84%
but life on Earth began,
most scientists say,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.610 align:middle line:90%
40,000 to 50,000 years ago.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They have repetitively
incarnated onto Earth.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm an example of that.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Somewhere in history.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.548 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I'm an
Earth-based soul.

00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been coming here sort of
ad nauseam for tens of thousands

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.080 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I'm regressing a lot
of clients in the last 10 to 12

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
years who discover they're
interplanetary souls, meaning

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:90%
they don't regularly come here.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:84%
They come here on occasion,
and they come to Earth,

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
if I oversimplify the
explanation, because they're

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:90%
highly evolved.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And they come from
evolved, healthy locations.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:26.440 align:middle line:84%
They come to teach us how
to progress as humanity.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can it be hard
for them to adapt, though,

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
to this life, this
history, this planet?

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: My guides
pushed me a few years ago

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:10%
to write this newest
book that I've written,

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:10%
which is filled with
client material that comes

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:10%
from interplanetary souls.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:10%
And so it's about their gifts,
their wisdom, their skills,

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:10%
and their struggles.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And their struggles are sizable,
because simplistically, they're

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.040 align:middle line:90%
not used to human bodies.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not used to
human way of life.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They're not used
to human nutrition,

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.830 align:middle line:84%
socialization, human
chemicals in the air.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:90%
They struggle a great deal.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
hypersensitive, but also,

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.430 align:middle line:84%
can you identify them, like
certain characteristics?

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
If someone's
watching and they're

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.464 align:middle line:84%
starting to identify
with what you say,

00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:20.810 align:middle line:84%
what are some other
characteristics of an IP soul?

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.152 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And I'll start a
little bit with IP adults.

00:45:23.152 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, probably,
it's important for us

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to talk about IP, or
interplanetary, children.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
IP adults, again, it's
that classic thing of they

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:90%
have great wisdom.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:36.050 align:middle line:84%
They seem to see
the bigger picture.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they even
physically appear unique.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:45.862 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they are people
that wear really unusual--

00:45:45.862 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying not to sound the
least bit judgmental, because I

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:90%
don't mean it that way.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They wear unusual
color combinations.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.350 align:middle line:84%
They wear unusual
prints and plaids.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.482 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it's not
something that matters.

00:45:56.482 --> 00:45:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It doesn't matter.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They have sometimes unusual
haircuts and hairstyles,

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:90%
hair colors.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they look
average and ordinary, too,

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:09.334 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want
to overstate that.

00:46:09.334 --> 00:46:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are they fascinated
with the stars and the planets

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.500 align:middle line:90%
and astronomy?

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
one client, probably

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
from a few weeks ago, where he
said to me, after we discovered

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.370 align:middle line:84%
through his regression that
he's an interplanetary soul, he

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
said, all my childhood,
I could do nothing

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:90%
but stare out the window.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get enough of
staring out at the sky at night.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought I
was weird and strange.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said to
me, now I know why.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.477 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it gives
that context, again.

00:46:38.477 --> 00:46:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about people that
feel that they've been abducted

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
or are extremely
interested in disclosure

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and aliens and other planets
and spaceships and so forth,

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that are really
deeply connected?

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I just want
to say yes, yes, yes.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they've
been on another planet

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.910 align:middle line:90%
most of their life, lifetimes?

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:01.172 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd asked
me 25 years ago,

00:47:01.172 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Linda, do you believe
this kind of stuff?

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I'd go, oh, just that's crazy.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have
clients that begin--

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm intending to guide
a past life regression,

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and the first scene is
literally in a spaceship.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And some listeners
might go, oh, well,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:84%
the client was just
making that up.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The level of detail,
and the level of

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:90%
not only the detail of the ship.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We get literal
physical detail of what

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.680 align:middle line:84%
materials is it made from and
what do the controls look like.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.980 align:middle line:84%
The chain of command on
the ship is explained.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:84%
The interrelationships of the
chain of command on the ship

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.900 align:middle line:90%
is explained.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
There's far too many details,
in my opinion, to be made up.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems
like it's real, just

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.780 align:middle line:84%
like any other
regression in history.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.326 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have the
history books to show it.

00:47:51.326 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, Lisa,
I have no doubt it's real.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It comes up spontaneously.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't guide the regression
in that direction.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't prompt it that way.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It happens completely--
I mean, that's

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:84%
my cardinal rule
with regression,

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.340 align:middle line:90%
is don't lead the witness.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.370 align:middle line:90%
So I don't prompt it that way.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And it explains
things to the client

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that they never had,
again, content for.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do they tend to be
in a specific profession

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.680 align:middle line:84%
or here to tell us something
or impact position in life?

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything there?

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean, that's
what's really cool, in a way.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:30.200 align:middle line:10%
Some of these are tall,
muscular engineer men

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:10%
that you would never dream, in a
million years, were an IP soul.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are people that come

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:84%
in with these unusual
clothes and unusual colors

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and unusual haircuts.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:41.585 align:middle line:90%
It varies from A to Z.

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then they
somehow find themselves

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.380 align:middle line:90%
to a past life regression.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the children,
and how do you identify

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.380 align:middle line:90%
children who might be IP souls?

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think this is
really crucial, because I think

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:84%
there are so many children
that we are mislabeling

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and that we don't understand.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And they're children
with diagnoses like ADHD.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes the autistic
spectrum is a misnomer.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of these children
simply come from planets

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.140 align:middle line:90%
where they don't talk.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They have telepathic
communication.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They have healthy
lives, but they don't

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.020 align:middle line:90%
socialize the way humans do.

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But these are also children
that are phenomenally gifted.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I think about there's a little
girl that Ellen DeGeneres has

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:90%
had on her show many times.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And this little girl
knows presidents

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.899 align:middle line:90%
backwards and forwards.

00:49:30.899 --> 00:49:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very intelligent.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.273 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, she's phenomenal.

00:49:33.273 --> 00:49:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll bet she's an IP soul.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:90%
But we need to support them.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the parents of them.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have
you had experiences

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:84%
where you've
identified an IP child,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.000 align:middle line:90%
and did it help the parent?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
what I end up doing

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.760 align:middle line:84%
is you can't regress
young children.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not sophisticated
enough to be regressed.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So I often work in spiritual
counseling with the parents

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and help the parents understand
their child, why their child is

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:90%
unique in this way.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just
add, when I started

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.490 align:middle line:84%
discovering so many
interplanetary souls

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.260 align:middle line:84%
in my practice, about
10 to 12 years ago,

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.960 align:middle line:84%
one of our
grandchildren was born,

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:90%
who is now about to be 12.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And he has an
interplanetary soul.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this all
happen simultaneously

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:23.840 align:middle line:84%
for me for a reason, so
that I understand him

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and, in certain ways,
can support my own son

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and daughter-in-law.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Because he's been diagnosed
ADHD and is advanced in math

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:90%
and delayed in other ways.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.220 align:middle line:90%
He's doing much better.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With just
simple communication?

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how would that help him?

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, you're probably
from a celestial planet?

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.060 align:middle line:90%
How would that help them?

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We've not, like,
literally said that to him.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:54.260 align:middle line:10%
What's helped him is to
be accepting of who he is.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And then other
things have happened.

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:90%
His diet has been changed.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.810 align:middle line:90%
His diet has been altered.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He's taking supplements that
are making a huge difference.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.270 align:middle line:84%
His parents get him in ways
they didn't get him before.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's in a wonderful school
that understands these children

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.450 align:middle line:90%
with learning differences.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But an adult, I mean, where
they find themselves fascinated

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
with video games that are
futuristic and so forth,

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is there a way that--
or a group of people

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.490 align:middle line:90%
they can communicate with.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any way of IP souls
connecting with each other?

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I
mean, sometimes I'll

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:84%
work with a new
client, and they'll

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:37.270 align:middle line:84%
have certain issues that are
related to them being IP souls.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:84%
At times, I might communicate
and get permission

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.760 align:middle line:84%
from a different client
and connect them together.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.180 align:middle line:90%
I've done some group work--

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I
was going to say--

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: --with IP souls.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --they could
reincarnate in groups, right?

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and it's why I
wrote the third book,

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about this,
so people could read about it.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have you
found soul groups

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that have reincarnated together
that you've introduced?

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.480 align:middle line:90%
IP soul groups?

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:90%
That's not happened a lot.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I've done that a bit more
with Earth-based souls.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But I do work with
the IP soul client

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to help them discover do they
know anyone else in their life

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:21.800 align:middle line:84%
who is an IP soul, to help them
identify someone in their life.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll add in, also,
it may be important,

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, for people to know, often,
IP souls come to the Earth

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:28.970 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon for an IP soul
to come here without members

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:90%
of their soul group.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They've come as a scout.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.360 align:middle line:84%
They've come to help
prepare others from where

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.400 align:middle line:90%
they come from to come here.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So they need a lot of
support and understanding.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And skills in
order to cope on Earth.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Here,
understanding who they are

00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:84%
is one thing, but then the
socialization and workplace

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:84%
etiquette and so forth
that would help them manage

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.090 align:middle line:90%
a little bit easier on Earth.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, and acceptance.

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like they can go
into their job and focus.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But then, they need to not beat
up on themselves because they

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
go home and listen to
music for three hours

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:90%
because that's what they need.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:10.900 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.560 align:middle line:90%
That's terrific.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.830 align:middle line:84%
When you take someone through
a typical past life regression,

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a very relaxing
state, isn't it?

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It's peaceful.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, it's what we
call alpha or theta brain wave

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:26.270 align:middle line:84%
state, which if people
understand that,

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a relaxed place
where they're conscious.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.312 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a place
of greater ease.

00:53:33.312 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In a past life
regression session, have

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:40.580 align:middle line:84%
you ever discovered an illness
through the session, where

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.190 align:middle line:84%
somebody would then go
to a doctor's office

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and validate a malignant
cell or something like that?

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened?

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So you're
probably asking more about

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.140 align:middle line:84%
like what we call medical
intuitive work, where

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the client discovers,
in the regression,

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:57.830 align:middle line:90%
they currently have an illness?

00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Correct.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think no
is the best answer.

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have I
discovered information

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:09.410 align:middle line:84%
about past life that explains
literal illness the client is

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.250 align:middle line:90%
aware they have?

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But discovering an undiagnosed
illness as yet, no.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:18.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, that's good.

00:54:18.653 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's dreams,
and medical intuitives

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.000 align:middle line:90%
do that, as well.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.170 align:middle line:84%
What about you, as a mom,
being the mother of two,

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:29.355 align:middle line:84%
how do they explain
what their mom does?

00:54:29.355 --> 00:54:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, that is
a wonderful question.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.010 align:middle line:84%
One of my children
is a psychologist.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.120 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is actually
a psychologist.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And she does wonderful work
with children and families

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and forensic work and
that kind of thing.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I am actually the unique mother
and the unique grandmother.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I am much more
spiritually focused

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:54.440 align:middle line:84%
than my children are, probably
because I'm not their mother.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.960 align:middle line:84%
My children-in-law, so I
have two married children,

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.990 align:middle line:90%
are a bit more accepting.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:90%
My children are respectful.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:03.477 align:middle line:90%
They're not into this anywhere.

00:55:03.477 --> 00:55:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're not?

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They're
not anywhere near.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
at times, Lisa,

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.650 align:middle line:90%
is their friends are.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So I will meet their
friends, and their friends

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:84%
will start asking me
all kinds of questions,

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.650 align:middle line:90%
and they're fascinated.

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, my children
just kind of sit back

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.440 align:middle line:90%
and let that happen.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But remember, I'm the
mom, and I'm not the mom

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to their friends.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they find it's
fascinating, what you do.

00:55:27.295 --> 00:55:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But at least your
daughter was inspired

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and went into some
type of therapy work.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is great.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So the RavenHeart
Center is a school

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.850 align:middle line:84%
where you say you teach
people how to do past life

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.270 align:middle line:90%
regression on others.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:90%
And what is that protocol?

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.446 align:middle line:84%
Just briefly, what
would it look like?

00:55:46.446 --> 00:55:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, it's
two levels of training.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Past life regression training
is almost like regression 101.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:53.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the first training.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And the second training is
between lives regression.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I call that almost
like 301 or 401.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.100 align:middle line:90%
There's two types of training.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I train face-to-face, and I
also do the past life regression

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
training through a video
conferencing mode as well as

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.080 align:middle line:90%
face-to-face.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.310 align:middle line:84%
The between lives
regression training

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.600 align:middle line:90%
has to be face-to-face.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.800 align:middle line:90%
It's deep.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It's profound.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We practice with each other,
as we do in the past life.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But I offer both
types of training.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
very delicate type

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.960 align:middle line:84%
of work, where you're really
walking into somebody's

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.310 align:middle line:90%
subconscious mind.

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be very clear,
very careful, and very ethical.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes,
and well-trained.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm a stickler-- maybe it's
because I'm a psychologist.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:42.314 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to
be a psychologist

00:56:42.314 --> 00:56:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to be an effective
regression therapist,

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so I want people to hear
that loud and clear.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people who train with me
are absolutely not credentialed

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.160 align:middle line:90%
psychotherapists.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But it requires
training to understand

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.920 align:middle line:84%
what do you do if the client
moves forward to a next scene,

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:90%
there isn't a next scene?

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when
to move backward?

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:08.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you know what to do with
the anxious client, the sobbing

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:08.870 align:middle line:90%
client?

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right,
that's uncontrollably

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.985 align:middle line:84%
discovering something
that makes so much sense.

00:57:12.985 --> 00:57:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The
client discovering

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the Holocaust past life,
which you and I have both

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:18.199 align:middle line:90%
experienced.

00:57:18.199 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:90%
It's always purposeful, though.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.614 align:middle line:84%
And I always want to say,
it's important for people

00:57:21.614 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:90%
to understand I'm not the guru.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The gurus of my clients
are their spiritual guides

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and their soul self.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Their soul.

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.506 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And that's where
the information comes from, is

00:57:31.506 --> 00:57:33.110 align:middle line:90%
their soul and their guides.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I found that
you were on Dr. Oz,

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's wonderful that this
conversation has become more

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:40.580 align:middle line:90%
acceptable in the mainstream.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.201 align:middle line:90%
What was that experience like?

00:57:42.201 --> 00:57:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It was great.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Dr. Mehmet Oz is very
much into this kind of work,

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.170 align:middle line:84%
as is his wife, for
people who know his wife.

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.559 align:middle line:10%
He's very open to this
kind of spiritual--

00:57:53.559 --> 00:57:55.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I wouldn't have been
invited to be on his show,

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:57.960 align:middle line:10%
obviously, if that
hadn't been the case.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And so he's very into this.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I would hazard to say he's
a very experienced soul

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and is a very caring individual.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:10.070 align:middle line:10%
And so I felt like
it was a gift to be

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:14.930 align:middle line:10%
asked to do something that
was so broadly accepted

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.130 align:middle line:10%
and recognized.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It's growing.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Slowly but surely, it's growing.

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's growing.

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:20.176 align:middle line:84%
And did you get good
reaction from that?

00:58:20.176 --> 00:58:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Very much so.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, and it's great.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.564 align:middle line:84%
They watched somebody
go through a regression

00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and really got to
see how safe it is.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to be able to show that

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:33.050 align:middle line:84%
to a national audience,
that it's safe.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be through
someone who's experienced,

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that is a professional, that
goes through a protocol.

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And how to do it the right way.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, especially when
they hit upon a big picture

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:84%
like that, when somebody
really makes a big discovery.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I always ask my guests,
what is your biggest why?

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:56.430 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest reason
for doing what you do?

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I have no doubt
that I know why I do what I do,

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's because my soul
agreed to do this work.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:10%
My soul agreed to
help people discover

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:07.050 align:middle line:10%
who they are at the core.

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:12.300 align:middle line:10%
So they know why they're
here, what's happened before.

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.570 align:middle line:84%
All of us have challenges,
so it goes back to that book

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:16.600 align:middle line:90%
from years ago.

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.460 align:middle line:90%
They're not bad things.

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:24.600 align:middle line:84%
They are karmic cleanup
things and things that

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.340 align:middle line:90%
cause us to evolve as a soul.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So I honestly don't
struggle with why,

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:31.790 align:middle line:90%
but that's a beautiful question.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're unwavering.

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:35.440 align:middle line:90%
You're solid in what you do.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And you will keep
going to spread

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:40.260 align:middle line:90%
this great message to humanity.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for
sharing with us what past life

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.110 align:middle line:84%
regression is, how
to make it safe,

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and really how to let people
know that there's repeated soul

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.290 align:middle line:84%
experiences on this planet
and to find out what they are.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Thank you, Lisa.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mine, too.

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
